0,"Just called suicide hotline. Thanks, Tom.","I called the suicide hotline because I’ve been sad for a long time. Had enough norco to overdose and almost did. Instead, I called a suicide hotline and was connected with Tom. He coached cross country. I run cross country and track for my university. He said he is now a fan of my team and will watch for my name on the leaderboards. Thanks for giving me even the slightest reason to keep going, Tom.

In recent days we've been targeted by a PM troll who's been sending pro-suicide messages to people after they post here.  The admins have suspended the main account this person was using, and they're looking out for alts, but if these types of individuals sometimes try to get around their site-wide bans.  We feel it's better to let you know this might happen again so that you can be forewarned, and also so that if it does happen, we and the reddit community team will be alerted as soon as possible.

If you get a hateful, pro-suicide PM, please be aware that this person is doing this indiscriminately, and they probably haven't even read what you posted, so it's *not about you*.  

If you don't think you could handle receiving something like that, we completely understand.  In that case, your best protection is to set your messaging preference so that you can receive PMs from trusted users only before you post (anywhere, not just here) about your struggles.

1,Attempt failed. Currently in the hospital.,"I tried I really did, but the second I took the pills I instantly regretted it. I called 911. In the ambulance is when I really noticed what I had done. And having the paramedics there to calm me down and help me was everything to me. I'm currently in the hospital. I can't leave my room unless it's to go to the bathroom. I can't even close my curtain to get privacy. They took every single cable and metal object out of the room. I'm in terrible pain. I didn't sleep at all last night. Hospital beds are the worse. I miss my bed and my dog :( 

Despite the dreary scene of the hospital the nurses and doctors have been nothing but nice and supportive. The nurse who drew my blood even drew a little smiley face on my bandaid to cheer me up a little. One nurse even gave me her number in case I ever need some support. I've never been treated so nicely by a group of strangers. Every single one of them giving me a different purpose to live. Thankfully I didn't ingest too much pills to damage my body too much. Just slight kinda damage but nothing life threatening. 

But this has made me realize a lot. Life really is worth living. No matter your situation. There are PLENTY of people who can be there for you. Every single nurse and doctor here gave me thousands of resources to help me. And this has given me the will to live. 

I should be getting out by Tuesday when a psychiatrist comes to mentally evaluate me and give me permission to leave. Until then I'm in a hospital room prison being watched over like a baby but it's good to know that there's people out there who truly care. 

To all the people considering suicide. Please don't do it. It's not worth it. I truly thought I had no one and my family wouldn't care. But seeing their crying faces when the ambulance took me away made me realize that even when you think you have no one you're wrong. The selfish decision I made will be in my mind forever but it gives me a reason to go on. We're all strong enough if we really try. 

Stay strong and reconsider your choice. 


EDIT: I didn't think my post would get so much attention, seeing as my other posts wouldn't get much. I'm sorry if I can't reply to all of the comments it's really a lot! However, thank you to all the kind people and positive messages. I'm glad to see my story is helping others as well.

2,Do you guys fantasize about your suicide?,"I think about it a lot. Like I imagine how it'll play out.

0,I wish I could give my life to someone who wants to live,"Sometimes, I wish I could trade places with a terminal cancer patient who is holding onto life as tightly as he can. I do not have any enthusiasm for life, and it seems like a waste. I feel like I am going through the motions, just waiting to die... and it's going to be a long wait. I have been in therapy for 10 years, and it's constantly like this. I wish euthanasia for mental illness were a thing.

See, there is nothing in this world that brings me joy. I do not have any hobbies, and I do not have a job. I am going to be evicted if I do not find something before May, and while I have been applying, I also don't see the point. I have this black-and-white image in my head-- like a flipbook-- of me going through the motions until I am older enough to retire. I think I would rather cut to the chase because being alive hurts. There mornings where I wake up and take a handful of sleeping pills to make myself fall asleep again. That's really what I am doing... I am waiting to die.

It kind of feels good to type this out. I have not been out of my apartment for almost two weeks. It's almost like I've forgotten what the sound of my own voice sounds like. My boyfriend recently moved away, and we hardly talk anymore. My therapist dumped me (it's a long story + it was kinda my fault, so dont blame her), so I am without support (or structure). I do not have any friends. My family thinks I am being a drama queen and won't ""play"" this game with me anymore. If I were to kill myself tonight, I wonder how long it would take the world to notice. I imagine it would take a while unless my decomposing body starts to smell and a neighbor complains.

I have prescriptions for a whole cocktail of drugs, but I am not 100% certain that an overdose would be successful. I'm 80% sure since I have stimulants and relaxants and sedatives and with some alcohol-- I don't drink, so I image I don't have a lot of tolerance-- it almost feels like I can pull it off. My biggest fear is failing. I am afraid I will only have a seizure and then have to deal with the aftermath of my suicide attempt. God, I don't want to spend more time in a psych ward.

0,I was born a hermaphrodite and I want to die because of it.,"I don't even know how to put all of my thoughts down properly here. I've been having terrible emotional breakdowns lately and I have no idea if talking about it will even help. All of the problems in my life are directly tied to a condition I was born with and how I've been treated because of it.

Based on what I know, when I was born my biological sex was ambiguous and doctors tried to have me surgically ""corrected"" into a female. My parents have denied knowing anything about it, but they refuse to let me have access to my medical records even though I'm an adult. The only reasons I have information about it are because of scars, genital pain, and hormone/ internal ultrasound testing from my gyno.

Nothing about my body is sexually correct. I have breasts, but I have male pattern chest hair and pubic hair. I have what should be a vagina, but it's actually just a small hole so narrow that I can't even use a tampon, much less have sex with it. I was born with a phallus, but they shaved it down until it was the appropriate size to be a clitoris. It hurts a lot now, even as an adult. Its like a terrible stinging sensation that gets so bad sometimes that it's brought me to tears before. I can't even touch the left side of it because it stings and burns so badly. 

I've always known that something was wrong about my body, even as a kid I knew that certain things weren't right and that I didn't feel the way that other girls did. My parents refused to acknowledge it and hid everything from me.

My parents were very rigid about gender roles when I was growing up and they punished me whenever I didn't behave like my forcibly assigned sex. Most of my earliest memories are of me crying because I was forced to wear dresses, makeup, and necklaces. I vividly remember begging my mom not to pierce my ears and spending my whole childhood wishing my ears would close up again because wearing earrings made me feel deeply sick.

When I got older, it just got worse. My parents wouldn't let me have hobbies or join clubs that they thought ""weren't for my gender."" they stopped me from doing even simple things like learning to play the trumpet. They refused to ever let me cut my hair above shoulder length and would only let me wear clothes that were ""girl colors"". If I did anything that deviated from what they wanted, they would scream at me and call me a faggot or a dyke. Even now as an adult living in their house they do this, and they've said physically threatening things like ""You're not too old for us to spank you."" 

When I turned 18 I started having serious medical problems. I ended up with an exceedingly rare kidney disorder from a hormone imbalance that came from the surgeries I was forced to have as a baby. I nearly died from it that winter, but still my parents told me nothing about my medical history. 

I didn't get diagnosed until I was 20, when my pain was getting so horrific that I had to quit school and my job. I went for my first visit to a gyno and she told me that I was abnormal. I felt like a complete idiot when she told me. My parents had always pulled  me out of sex ed in school, and I was raised in such a strict religious environment that I sincerely had never seen what anatomy was supposed to look like.

And I felt so broken and stupid then. 

I was so scared of what would happen that I didn't tell my parents anything that my doctor told me. I had been dating my boyfriend for years already and I was so scared to tell him that I waited months before I said anything to him either. 

I just feel like such a failure. I was never even remotely happy as a woman, but I know that my family, my boyfriend, and everyone else could never accept me as a man either. And I've never felt like a man in the first place. I've always felt like I was something between that, even as far back as I can remember. But I know that people could never understand that. Even someone as loving, patient, and kind as my boyfriend can't fully understand how deeply this hurts me.

I feel so completely alone in the world. I feel mutilated. I feel like a disappointment to my family because I can never be what they wanted physically or emotionally. I can't take the pain anymore either. I'm constantly peeing blood and my kidney feels like a knife in my back. I've been suffering from depression and dysphoria since early childhood, and years of therapy haven't helped me. 

I just want it to end. No more talk from my parents about how my entire existence is a sin. No more feeling like I'm a horrible mistake. And no more feeling like it's going to destroy my relationship and hurt the only person who ever truly loved me. 

I wish there were a way to fix this. I wish my parents had left my body alone and raised me in a way where I could have been myself. But now I feel so lost and alone that I don't even know who or what I am.

0,nobody cares if youre suicidal until you actually commit suicide,"I often fantasize about dying. I don't want to be here anymore. it's not even so much out of sadness anymore as it is just out of thinking realistically. there's literally no point. the only thing holding me back from doing it is I don't want to do that to my parents. 
besides feeling like I just want to be dead, I also deal with intense depression and thoughts that torment me. I can't shake the feeling that something is just wrong with me and I'm never going to be happy or deserve to be happy. there's this void in me and no matter what I do, nothing fills it. 

I tried talking to my ex about this while we were dating. I told him about my self harm and how I just want to die. about the self harm, he told me to cut the ""right way"" if I wanted real results. for the depression and suicidal thoughts, he said he felt the same except he had a worse life, so his depression was more justified. he said I have a lot to be happy for. 

it just made me want to kill myself even more. but the thing is, I don't think I want to die. I just wish everything would stop and I could start over as someone else. 
and honestly, when I think about killing myself, I fantasize about it not working, but working just enough to hospitalize me. it's a sick fucking thought, I know.
I think the main reason I want to attempt suicide is so the people around me will realize that I'm not just faking it or ""choosing"" to be depressed. it's not just for attention... which is ironic to say, considering I want to do it literally to get their attention. but I just feel like, in order for my pain to be taken seriously, I need to show it to people somehow.",95icab,720.0,0.99,51.0,2018-08-08 03:03:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/95icab/nobody_cares_if_youre_suicidal_until_you_actually/,0.0,0.0,2018.0,8.0

1,"I killed my girlfriend, and now I want to kill myself.."," 

Before you read my true story, I want you to know that I'm not very good at English, as it's my second language so bare with me if I have made grammatical mistakes or anything, and honestly I really haven't opened up about this incident in my life, until today.

Anyway,

This one random late night in March 2017, I decided to download the Tinder app (probably the worst decisions in my life) , but I'm genuinely a introvert person, so it's hard for me to make conversation on spot to get to know people. Most people hop on tinder to troll, some to get laid but I was on it to find ""true love"". Fast forward to two months of most girls wanting to just party or I was to boring to form a conversation, this one random day I got super liked by this girl named Laura. We both started to talk, we both had a lot of similarities between us and she was literally 2 miles away from my place. It had been 2 weeks, we both still haven't meet but our conversations started to get more personal, and I felt a real connection between us two. We both replied long, it used to take me a good 45mins to an hour to reply, it was just how it was. It was however odd for me that she was really beautiful, and I was a ugly mf. She came from a small town family, where as me, I was a city kid, from a wealthy family (although she didn't know that for along time).

After the 2 weeks of talking, we both decided to meet up for lunch. Like when I say she was simple, she had no idea about brands or anything. I dressed up with some yeezy 750s, she didn't even know them. And some part of me liked that she was like that, because most of the times, I only wore to show off, to feel rich, to feel accepted. One thing about being rich is that, the definition of happiness is so different to what a average person would say. Like an average person has aspirations of having a nice house, a nice car, nice gadgets and all but it's different being born wealthy, like I had everything that anyone would aspire of having, it's different when you have everything. Anyway that just made me like Laura more because she was a simple person, a bit mysterious and I was always curious to know more about her.

We ended up dating for 6 months, and I knew she was the one for me, she was beautiful, she loved me for who I was, I didn't have to pretend to be this cool dude like I did with my friends, she loved the sensitive little bitch I was. Everything was going well, till (Jan 2018) she called and cried, her father was diagnosed with lung cancer at a bad stage, the doctors said they could cure it but he would only survive for a couple of months. Laura was going through some tough times, but I was always with her, trying to make her strong. She would tell me stories about her dad, like how they used to horse ride back when they used to live on farm lands, and how he would work 14 hours everyday just his both daughters could have the life that every other kid had. Tbh that got me so depressed, like the fact that her father sacrificed so much for his kids and all. But no matter what had happened over the next few months, years or the next decade or so, i said to myself that I would always be with Laura, and I wanted to marry her.

We got back to our casual routines, she was getting better and better, and on her birthday 11th of March, I proposed to her, I honestly didn't know if it was the right time or not, but I felt like I needed to tell her that I'm gonna be committed and not just saying it but i wanted to show her. Laura said yes, cried and hugged so hard that I thought she would break my bones, but I knew that this meant a lot to her.

April 11th 2018.

This part is going to be hard for me, as I am typing my fingers are twitching, I'm really scared, because to say it out is something i haven't done... Anyway, on this very day, I picked up Laura, we were driving to the hospital to visit her dad, we went on the highway. Till this high speeding car (prolly doing 150kmph) tried to overtake a vechile in front of us so we were behind this car, but suddenly suddenly the person slammed the brakes and dropped back, causing me to smash into the car. After this moment, I don't remember a thing. It felt like I died, I could hear my surroundings but I couldn't see anything, Idk how long or anything I woke up and the first thing I asked was ""what happened to laura?"" and my mum started to cry but i thought she was crying for me. I kept asking, and no one replied. Then it hit me, it hit me that she's not alive, and i couldn't understand. It all happened in a flash of a second.. The love of my life was gone, and I could do nothing about it, i didn't know how to take it in, it fucked me up. I only had minor injuries, but I was mentally dead.

Fast forward to a month, I still was in shock, infact I still am.. I went to visit her family, to apologies, but couldn't even let out a word, just cried out loud, but somehow they understood my pain. Laura's dad seemed to be weaker, her mum always had a smile on but she looked so bad, she was in shock and it just made me feel worse and worse. A week later, I found out that Laura's dad had passed away, i wasn't ready for the funeral, I didn't go to laura's too because I couldn't accept it but my mum told me that I had to go to comfort her mum. But laura's mum had completely changed, she didn't want to hear anything from anyone because two of the most people in her life had passed away and I honestly could do nothing but cry looking at her.

Fast forward it to now, there hasn't been a day I felt that I could have done better, I could have reacted better, and if i had turned the other way, maybe I could have died instead of laura, maybe she survived she could have been with her dad for the rest of time, maybe seeing her daughter would have kept him alive for a bit longer, maybe the mum would have been brave having her daughter around. I know it's not my fault, i've heard people say that constantly, it's not fault bro"" but I could have done better, to prevent it, and that is stuck in my mind, and always will. I honestly have no hope for life, I just want to die, i can't get over these thoughts, I just hope I die real soon.... It's not that I want sympathy but I just can't deal with it, it hurts.",9rq2jd,648.0,0.98,61.0,2018-10-27 00:19:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/9rq2jd/i_killed_my_girlfriend_and_now_i_want_to_kill/,0.0,0.0,2018.0,10.0

0,"They'll let you be homeless but tell you suicide is ""never the answer""..","Honestly, this is one of the most puzzling things about society. People tell you that ""we don't live in a vaccum. everyone has people who care"" along with other shamings of suicide calling you ""cowardly"".

But when you want to live...oh no. You're entitled to nothing. If you don't do well in school your parents kick you out and you end up homeless liviing on a cardboard box. 

But remember, don't kill yourself because ""people care about you so much""

It’s close to midnight. It’s dark and cold. My door is closed. As I lay about to fall asleep I hear something. I’m half awake half asleep so I don’t really acknowledge it. I turn on my right side and try to fall asleep again. But then I hear something. I open my eyes too scared to turn back over to see what it is. It sounded like someone was crawling beside my bed. Here I lay, trying to figure out what it is. Then I hear a very loud “hey!” Yelled right in my ear. I instantly sit up and look around my room but of course I see nothing. I must just be paranoid.

It was a few months after my mom married him. I never really liked him. When he did what he did, I was too young to understand what it meant. He’d put me on his lap, grab my sides and butt when my mother was working. He called me his “favorite”. It was just touching then. How I wish it never had to be more. 
~••••••~
2007
We had just got back from a family party the first time it happened. It was really late at night and my mother went to sleep as soon as we got home I remember being half awake as she told him to carry me to bed as I was already sleeping from the car ride home. Their room was upstairs mine was in the basement. As he put me to bed he started touching me. By then I was awake. He was on top of me and told me to be quiet as he held his hand over my mouth. I remember crying and looking out my bedroom window counting in my head thinking of when it was going to be over. I was in so much pain. When he was done, he told me again how I was his favorite. I couldn’t do anything but cry. The next morning my mom was already gone at work and there I was, stuck in a house with a monster. 
~••••••~
2013
It was going on for a few years now. Yes, I did want and try to tell my mom about it, but I was so scared she wouldn’t love me anymore and would blame me for it happening so I never did, because he said if I told, she wouldn’t want me anymore. In school my grades dropped, my attendance dropped, and I’d never pay attention. I felt so alone and so scared. Yes, I did self harm as I felt that the pain of that would not hurt as much as the pain from him. I did run away, and when my councilor found out, I talked to her, I told her an excuse saying I didn’t wanna go home because I hated when he yelled, I couldn’t tell her the real reason was because of what he did to me almost every night. I couldn’t tell her as much as I wanted to. I felt so isolated. She called him and he had picked me up from school, when we got home he immediately did what he did to me almost every night and said I deserved it for being bad. My mom was always out working as she worked two jobs and would really only be home 7am-12pm. 
~•••••~
2015 
A few years later and it was still happening. I was sick every morning and when I told my friends about it they joked around saying I was pregnant. I laughed along but in my head I thought, “could I really be?”. I remember stealing a pregnancy test from a pharmacy and took it as soon as I got home. It was positive. I felt sick, then and there I wanted to throw up, no not from being pregnant but from being pregnant from him, my step father. I just wanted to die. I remember a few days going by as my mom cleaned my room she found the test. She yelled at me for not being careful and was yelling at me for becoming pregnant at such a young age. Little did she know, the father was the man she married, the man that has been sexually abusing me for years, my step father. I miscarried at 10 weeks, as bad as it may sound, I was glad I did. 
~••••••~
2016
My mom had finally divorced the piece of shit after she found out he was cheating and I had so much relief after that. I thought finally no more pain. Later that year, I was constantly getting in trouble, doing drugs, trying to be cool hanging with the “bad kids”. I was expelled mid freshman year. I started going to an alternative school for kids who got expelled from high schools. There I met a friend I’ve known since kindergarten. We started hanging out everyday after school. I thought to myself that wow someone is actually being nice to me. There was this Friday where I was hanging out with a different friend when I ran into him and his friends. We decided to all hang out and we went in an ally way to drink and he had given me some pills saying it would get me “high”. Being the uncaring trying to fit in cool kid I took them and drank. My friend I was with had left with some dude that he was hanging with. So it was just me him and his other friend. We decided to go chill in a stairwell. I was so gone off whatever I had taken and from all the drinking I did. I remember him asking to have sex and I said no. I passed out and next thing I knew he was on top of me as his friend watched. I quickly pushed him off put my pants back on and as I ran down the stairway crying I seen him and his friend high five. I called my sister for a ride home but didn’t tell her what happen. When I got home I started crying to my mom but all she did was yell at me for coming home late and didn’t even ask me why I was crying. I went in my room wondering how could he do that to me? Someone I knew since elementary school. How could this happen. As I laid in bed, I thought to myself that I was nothing. I was already being sexually abused from my step dad for years and now it happens again at age 16 from someone I called a friend. By then, all I wanted to do was die. I thought after that monster was out of my life I’d be a little okay, yet it happened again from someone I knew and considered a friend.

2018
I am 18 and I try to drink every weekend I can with older friends. Because I didn’t want to be sober on weekends when I was by myself I didn’t want to be alone with my thoughts. Because on weekdays I’d be occupied by work. So weekends I’d just drink every chance I could. It was not good. Everywhere I went to drink, there was always one dude touching me and pushing his self on me. I thought to myself wow I really can’t get away from this stuff. All my life I’ve endured so much pain from people I thought were supposed to protect me. Sure I drank and maybe you think it’s my fault for putting myself in such a situation like this. I couldn’t get away from it. I thought to myself the best way out of this hell of a loop is taking myself out. I’ve attempted suicide 3 times the past year. Soon it will be my time to go, because all I feel is pain and loneliness. I’m so scarred and paranoid from the things my step father did that every night I have to sleep with ear plugs in and a blanket over my face because I’m scared that he will be standing next to me even though I know he’s gone.

5,I hate that you can’t even mention suicidal thoughts because everyone will freak out,"Even if you have them and know you won’t act on them. I get in phases where every time something upsets me I have very graphic images of all the ways I could kill my self. My OCD urges it on, and my irrational side tries to tell me it’s the best option. I have too many responsibilities for that ever to be an option, though, even if I have doubts that I’ll ever be “happy.”

But I can’t say this to anyone because they’ll freak out. They’ll think they should call a hospital, or tell someone in my family, or at the very least treat me differently or not let me tell dark jokes. And all those types of reactions end up doing are further isolating me in my own mind while pretending to be relatively fine on the outside.

5,I jumped off a (small) bridge,"Surprise! I lived. The water was quite a bit deeper than I thought, and luckily there were no rocks or tree branches just below the surface. I went headfirst, so any debri would have likely killed me outright, or knocked me out and caused me to drawn. 

I still got a concussion just from the water (FYI, concussions suck. Do not recommend). And after I somehow managed to not drown anyway, I swam to shore. Holy crap was it a long, cold walk home. 

Believe it or not, I didn’t think it was that big a deal. It didn’t really feel like a true suicide attempt. More like it blurred the lines between ‘self harm’ and ‘suicide’. Before the jump I had figured a ~90% chance I’d live if the water was deep (I was gambling a lot on that “if”). 

When I got home I told my family, thinking they would just let me go to sleep with some asprin, maybe take the next day off. Nope. Not a chance. We went *straight* to the ER. Then I was volunteered to go to the inpatient psychiatric unit. 

The psych ward. I was pretty terrified. I didn’t think I was worthy of such care. My issues were mild, weren’t they? It was just (extreme) self harm. 

I spent five days in the hospital. And frankly they were some of the most incredible days I’ve ever experienced in my life. I dealt with both extreme pain and euphoria. At several points, I *was* the hysterical, crying, inconsolable woman who you’d expect to find in a padded room wearing a straight jacket. 

But they didn’t do that to me. They talked to me, and they helped me. They gave me the mental and emotional tools to help myself. Somehow, they got me to admit that I *wanted* to live, even though I desperately believed I didn’t deserve to. I’m trying to remember, every minute of every day, that I *do* deserve to live. 

Anyway... that’s kinda my little story. 

TL;DR: Jumped off a bridge, landed in a psych ward, got legit help.

Edit: wow thanks for the support everyone! I’ll try to answer your questions in more detail when I get a chance.

Right as I was about to “go out” my leg began to swing up and reached a ledge. It was my last strength. I pulled myself up with my remaining core strength and leg strength so that I was parallel with the bridge. This gave me room to breath again. I swung my arm up and around the rail so that I could attempt to take the belt off and I knew I only had one shot at this. I was successful, but my body gave out after the belt was free and I dropped into the water.

5,Attempted suicide a few hours ago and I'm shook and so scared.,"I've been at my all time rock-bottom for the past few days and I've been crying every night. It all accumulate this morning when I tried handing myself after my parents left for work. 

It's left me absolutely shook. Even writing this I'm shaking and my breathing is unnatural. I'm so scared, I'm really fucking scared. This is my first attempt so I've never felt anything like this before, the tears, the shaking, all of it. I can't stop crying, I can't believe this is real. Who knows if I'm gonna even be here next week, the way things are going I'm unsure, and this frightens the hell out of me.

I've had a therapist for the last 6 or so months and it really helped, but as soon as I stopped I instantly when back into my depressive state. I don't want to be stuck talking to a therapist my entire life. So I haven't been back and I don't plan too. 

If you've read this far, thank you so much for hearing me out, I just had to say this, I feel sick after what's happened.

Much love to everyone out there. Together, we'll get through this, all of us.

Edit: I really don’t care for what comes after I die.  I just know that it’s better than dealing with what’s here for me. Trust me, I’ve tried my best to keep moving forward in this world, but it’s all been pointless. I have no fear of being dead; I just struggle with the natural human instinct of fearing/avoiding pain. If there’s one thing in this life that I’m sure of, it’s that I want to die and it’s not a fleeting thought. I think about it the majority of every day.

The fact that so many individuals in the comments feel similarly is heartbreaking. Some of us are not fortunate or strong enough to go on living. Some of us have been beat down by life one too many times. I wish that was not the case, but unfortunately it is. It’s really saddening to see.

8,Therapy was the worst thing that happened to me,"A few years ago when I was suicidal I was lied to by my therapist and told we were going to the hospital for an emergency prescription change. At the time, it made sense. But looking back I feel like such an idiot. 

As I got to the hospital I was honest about how I felt suicidal, but made no plans to commit suicide, and had no method. The doctor told me that soon he’d have a discussion with me about what would be best for me. The second they got me a wheelchair I knew my mistake. I shouldn’t have been honest at all. They all lied to me. There was no discussion, no prescription change. They locked me up in the hospital and for three days I didn’t even know how long I’d be there. 

When I finally got to meet with the doctors there, they wouldn’t listen to me and continuously mocked me and treated me like a child. They were obsessed with stupid parts of my life and wouldn’t listen to my diagnosis I told them I already had (Episodic Depression or Major Depressive? I forget because it’s been a few years and we’ve talked about other things) what I do remember is that at the end of the week they said they diagnosed me with the one I already said I have, like it was new!!!! Like THEY diagnosed me and not my psychiatrist at college!! 

One of the stupid things they were obsessed with was my relationship with my best friend (who is a guy- I’m a woman) and I had to repeatedly clarify he was a friend and they kept trying to get more information about it. It was so fucking weird. Like they asked me who my support system was and I said, “my friends, like this girl, that girl, and Guy” and they’re like WHO IS GUY!!!!!!!!!!! Like it would be such an enlightening thing for me to elaborate on even though I already said he’s a friend of mine. 

I had made some friends while I was in there. Some I still keep in contact with. But worst was just that Im now thousands of dollars in debt from this whole experience. 

I had nightmares for weeks. The anxiety of being locked up completely against your will with no way to contact the outside world but a monitored phone did real damage to me. Having no privacy, no real clothes, being constantly treated like a child- it was all so terrible. 

It sucked. It wasn’t worth it. I’ve learned to NEVER tell a therapist you’re suicidal.",bodzsr,534.0,0.98,114.0,2019-05-14 04:15:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bodzsr/therapy_was_the_worst_thing_that_happened_to_me/,0.0,0.0,,

I'll logically be on the streets and at that point I will kill myself. But why let it go that far?

I'm a loser and I'm okay with that. Not being a loser is seriously too much work. Giving enough shit to learn useful things is too much work.

8,"I asked last Saturday if ""Anyone there"" ? You answered. Thank you. I was half way through my suicide attempt.","I was on this site last week and need someone that I didn't know.

I have a toxic abusive relationship, I cannot find a shrink to save my life (Literally. ha), I'm going through a divorce, my soul mate died (dog), I'm having to move states, find work, find a new home, and am living with my parents as of my psychiatric hospital release the day before yesterday.

I had been half way through, and had 2 methods essentially.  I took a medication to make it so I wasn't scared to do it. In the closet I was in, I had my phone, I'd already filled out my suicide note, and dictated in my legal will and burial details what needed to be done. I wanted to go forward.  I can't now, but think if it were again ... I would have not called for help but just let one of the methods run its course and go to sleep. I wouldn't wake up again. I am still ok with that idea.

I stood in the closet and had a fraction of a second that I was sobbing trying to pump myself up and asked if anyone was here.  It didn't save my life, but it gave me a second to think that wasn't thinking about the problem, it was writing and reading. I put \*\*\* \*\*\* down. I called my husband (STBX) and was taken by ambulance.  I was put in a hospital for a 5 day week and am now at my parents house. Everything is locked up, I have no access to anything. I don't have my car. I'm safe.

1,"I am never ""suicidal enough"" to be heard. I am too well-dressed, too articulate, too friendly ""too"" everything to be worthy of any support.","And I am gradually withering away because of it.

Mental health professionals never take me seriously. I can see it in the hint of amusement in their eyes, their disengaged body language, their patronising tone of voice. They say I'm ""too"" well-dressed, ""too"" articulate, ""too"" intelligent. I am ""too"" kind, I smile ""too"" often, I'm ""too"" calm.

This has not only been offensive to me, but it is such an insult to people who are mentally ill and suicidal. Their implication that suicidal people are dumb, frenzied and rude slobs was - and still is - fucking preposterous.

I have tried to get help for approximately 8 years. I have begged and pleaded and been reduced to tears. But unless I'm trying to end my life right now in front of them, it doesn't matter. None of it matters. I don't matter. 

My public face is ""too"" convincing. But this was carefully created and crafted, over many years, because I had no choice. I had no option but to hide the abuse and isolation and pain I have suffered behind a smile. I was never given an alternative, and when someone glimpsed the reality behind this façade, they did nothing.

The truth is, a part of me is frightened of dying, and my survival instincts kick in when I don't want them to. But that doesn't mean I want to live, either. If I could switch off this deeply ingrained fear and just be done with it, I would. 

Why do we have to kill ourselves or almost die before people care? Why do we have to present ourselves in a specific way before we even get listened to? Why do they wait until every glimmer of hope and willingness to live has been stamped out? I hate this. I hate my life. I hate myself. Let me be what they want me to be, please.

**EDIT:** I never ever _ever_ consider others as ""dumb, frenzied, rude slobs"" by the way. I'm so sorry if I made anyone feel that way. It's simply how I interpret the reaction of mental health professionals, when they say ""But you're so clever/hygienic/pretty/well-groomed"" etc. It feels like a slap in the face, as though suicidal people are looked down on if they are well presented, and looked down on if they are not, too (but the latter apparently ticks more boxes from their point of view).
If someone is unkempt, hasn't showered, is visibly distressed or less coherent, I do NOT judge them or advocate doing so. _But using someone's appearance as a way of invalidating their pain? That's **completely** wrong._


**EDIT 2:** Thank you everyone for your supportive comments and sharing your experiences on this subject. It means a lot to me and although it is awful that this resonates with so many people, it also brings me comfort. I am sorry for not responding to everyone yet. If you have had a similarly invalidating experience, I am so sorry. I appreciate the difficulty internalising this, but it is _not_ your fault. You are not to blame for the misconduct of any medical professional, who ought to know better than to belittle us during our darkest and most vulnerable moments.


In positive developments, the crisis team visited me at home this evening. Both mental health nurses listened to me, emphasised that the way I was treated for the last 8 years was unacceptable, completely validated my feelings and showed a lot of empathy. It has restored a little bit of faith in the NHS. They are going to report back to the psychiatry team and recommend that I be allocated a Care Co-ordinator, who will be able to assist me with being prescribed the correct forms of treatment and provide support with finances and social connections. I have not allowed myself to anticipate too much, but I cried with relief after they left. I hope they keep their word. I hope they meant it. I desperately just hope. Until I receive an outcome, I will sincerely try to stay alive. I am not in a position to promise that I will survive, but I can promise that I will try, one more time.",ceryei,1837.0,1.0,100.0,2019-07-18 12:39:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ceryei/i_am_never_suicidal_enough_to_be_heard_i_am_too/,0.0,0.0,2019.0,7.0

""Have you considered volunteering/getting a job?""

Fuck yes. Fuck yes I have _considered_ every possible option and opportunity to make me **not** imagine shooting a bullet in my skull or dragging a blade across my throat or tying a rope around my neck.

Here's the problem: **It never works.**

I have had meaningful employment and voluntary roles that I genuinely enjoyed. I have socialised and met plenty of lovely people. I have spent the last six years in a loving and nurturing relationship with a wonderful man. I have taken long, beautiful strolls in nature by the river. I have fed the ducks and petted dogs and helped the elderly and looked after children. I have listened to music and played the piano and sang my favourite songs. 

The thing is, I can't walk without imagining myself hurling my body in front of a car, or drowning in the lake, or lying on the train tracks. I can't bake a cake from scratch without imagining myself plunging the kitchen knife into my wrists and bleeding out all over the counter. I can't meet new people without withdrawing, isolating myself and remembering that I am a burden. I am a parasite. I am worthless and I need to just die. I can't trust anyone because I have been abused and broken and betrayed so profoundly that everyone feels like a potential threat, the next predator. I can't work or volunteer or commit to anything without my joints aching and my bones creaking, without my mind spiralling and without my energy slipping away until I can barely move anymore. I can't enjoy a hug with my boyfriend without imagining him choking the life out of me. 

I can't do **anything** without wanting to die and picturing the multitude of ways I could end my life. I could be having an amazing day and feel so much relief because wow, for once I feel _good_. The thoughts will linger in the background and watch. They will creep a little closer and whisper in my ear and stand in front of me then climb inside my brain to remind me that they are still here - that they will **always** be here, no matter what I do to distract myself, to find hope, to find meaning. 

I'm lost. I'm lonely. I'm alienated. I'm tired. It is so difficult to find people who understand, because ""try not to kill yourself"" is not a part of everyone's daily routine. It's not on everyone's to-do list.

I have considered everything. I have tried everything. And I still want to die. Every. Fucking. Day.

3,I've gone to a hotel at the other end of the country to kill myself,"I'm due to head back tomorrow, at least that's what I've told people. I've quit my job because it's fucking pointless. None of this matters, life is arbitrary. We're thrown into a system completely devoid of any compassion, this isn't life, this is servitude and I refuse to play along anymore. I'm so fucking tired of plastering a smile on my face and pretending like everything is going to be okay. 

Have you looked at the news lately? Everything is falling apart around us, the planet is on fire, people are being rounded up, privacy is non-existent and we're told repeatedly that we have no value unless we've been commoditized. Buy this, buy that, you need this random, useless tatt but we don't! We don't *need* any of it but it's still rammed down our throats day in, day out, bombarding us from every fucking direction and I'm just exhausted. 

I can't do this for another 40 years, I'm done, I'm checking out and I don't mean from the hotel. I'm going to have a large gin and tonic while I run a bath. It might relax me amd there's a niggling voice at the back of mind screaming ""PLEASE DON'T DO THIS"" but I don't want to listen anymore. 

Mum, if by chance you happen to read this, please know that I love you and I'm truly, truly sorry for putting you through this. For what it's worth I'm so glad that you enjoyed Silverstone. I love you. I love you I fucking love you and im sorry

Edit: I'm still here. This has been the most difficult 24 hours of my life but I'm still here. I took the train back today and told my mum I needed to speak to her urgently, as soon as I saw her I told her I loved her, I told her why I went to a hotel and then I broke down in tears like an absolute mess. She told me she couldn't stand the thought of burying one of her sons, we hugged and I cried on her for about 20 minutes. I'm back at home now and reading most of the responses here has been overwhelming. I still don't think I can go on, but I think I'm going to at least try, until it becomes unbearable again anyway.",cj0tqt,1103.0,0.99,166.0,2019-07-28 20:19:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cj0tqt/ive_gone_to_a_hotel_at_the_other_end_of_the/,0.0,0.0,2019.0,7.0
4,This quote about suicide is feeling far too accurate,"""The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.""

This quote is from Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace.

I'm honestly starting to feel the flames, and the jump is looking far too comforting.",cb655d,1103.0,1.0,46.0,2019-07-09 20:11:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cb655d/this_quote_about_suicide_is_feeling_far_too/,0.0,0.0,2019.0,7.0
5,A letter to a friend who'll never read it.,"I saw you today. 

Things were good, better than good. You were smiling that idiotic smile that I love. Wearing that old and faded track pants that I begged you to throw away but you never did. Then you saw me. Your face lit up. You came towards me, held my hands and said the silliest, stupidest joke that I ever heard. You know I don't like jokes but you still make me laugh. How do you do that??

We were together after such a long time. Me nagging you, you making me laugh, falling in love all over again. It was just like old times. 

I saw you today. But then I woke up.

I wanted to hold on to you, to be with you and never let you go again, to go back into the dream where you were. But I couldn't. The harder I tried the farther you felt. 

Realization hit; I'd never see you again, I'd never talk to you, nag you, hold you, be held by you, give you the cherry on top of my ice-creams because I still don't like them. 

I hate you.

I hate you. I hate you. I hate you.

I hate you because you never loved me enough. I hate you because you never trusted me enough. And I hate you because you were in pain and you never bothered to share it with me.

Everytime I needed you, you were there. You never complained about the time. You let me cry, shout, rage when I was in pain. You helped me so much. But you never told that you were in pain. Why?? Why didn't you??

Did you not think that I'd do everything to comfort you. I may not have been able to take away your pain, but I would've held your hand through it. 

I hate you. and I'll always hate you. Because I love you. and I'll always love you. 

No one can take your place. You were entirely special. All that sickening positivity and patience. Was it all a lie then? A mask? A cover-up for your feelings?

I'm sorry I failed you. I should've looked deeper. Should've been a better friend. May be if I didn't rely on you so much, you would've been comfortable to rely on me. Is that why you couldn't even say goodbye?

I hate you and I'll always will. And someday I'm going to die as well. It may be now or eighty years from now or anytime in between. I'm going to die and then I'm going to find you in the afterlife. And I'd hit you and kick you and scratch you and strangle you and God knows what else. But I'll never let you go then. I'll always, always be with you. 

Till then, I'll hold you in my heart and dreams and memories.

I'll always love you, you perv.",c9ct10,944.0,0.99,93.0,2019-07-05 06:49:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/c9ct10/a_letter_to_a_friend_wholl_never_read_it/,0.0,0.0,2019.0,7.0

Well i was in a coma for a few days and i wrote a letter for my little sister to explain to her why i did what i did.
Little did i know, that letter would be read by everyone! And i mean everyone. I woke up and a therapist was beside me and the first thing she said was that she read my letter. I was so shocked and couldnt say anything for 3 seconds or more. Apparently she thought i didnt believed her so she just quoted the most disturbing and private part of it to me. My mother and all the people in the hospital read it too.

11,Why is it so hard for some people to accept that life just isn't that great for some people?,"Some people just get completely, utterly screwed, traumatized and limited by life, to the point that living just isn't enjoyable anymore. To the point that any wild-eyed optimism one might have had in the face of adversity just gets drowned by the utter disillusionment that no - sometimes even if there was a will, there's wasn't much of any way, and even if there still is, it's not worth finding.

I've seen people say they can't even imagine what it must feel like to want to end your life or to even be depressed. On the flip side, it's hard for me to imagine what it'd be like to not feel depression as that's been most of my life, with tiny windows of joy where it felt like my efforts to outrun my horrible background were paying off. Those windows have closed and even if there are others left to open somewhere, I don't care, because they don't even look like ways out anymore. I'm at the point someone could give me a million dollars and it wouldn't make me happy.

But guess what the worst thing of all is? You have a *survival instinct.* Living another day feels awful, but dying is still terrifying, and beyond that it's drummed into your head that you'll hurt people if you somehow think you might be able to overcome the strongest instinct of all. You don't even want to die, just for your reality to be fundamentally different, but that's obviously not how this all works.

So, you're stuck in this hell that's been aptly described like the mental equivalent to a burning building, and there's no grand purpose to it - there's no big meaning or reward for suffering through it - you just had really bad luck. You just happened to be the organism born to become self-aware within an absolutely shitty situation, to the point many people  objectively admit you were, and now you've got to either take it or leave it and both options feel pretty horrible, but one at least feels like a solution in that this whole situation simply ends.

The thing is, too, I bet if it was somehow possible for a person that feels normal, or god forbid, happy, to experience this feeling for a day, they'd totally understand wanting to leave it and be incredibly grateful they've never spent a day in the desperate void that leads one to truly consider suicide.

Keep spreading the love ❤️

Depression made me dumb, uninteresting, made me stop reading books, made me stop learning, caused me to spend days like a zombie, caused me amnesia, literally caused my brain to shrink. But the worst was the effect it had after 15 years of fucking my brain. Now I lost my mind. Now i lost that quirky weird fun personality. Now i have lost the cultured nerd that i used to be. I had to grow up getting bullied for being a nerd, for being weird, for not poisoning my mind with mindless activities and TV.

Then I grew up and I lost all of those qualities that were supposed to make me have a cool life and cool friends finally. I wanted to be in the art community, going to talks and book readings and exhibitions and come back from it open a bottle of wine and drink it around the aged wooden table which stands in the middle of the living room that is surrounded by weird and classic paintings, contemporary sculptures and talk about philosophy. I was supposed to be the cultured smart weird but interesting guy. I WAS THAT GUY. I was born to be that guy.

But depression fucked me. And for the past 5 years I had set the goal to become that person again. The real me. But i have not only failed but I have rotten even further. Depression is a disease and has to be dealt with early on, otherwise there's no point in living like a half vegetable, high on antidepressants during the day and sleeping while on benzos at night.

I lost 2 women I truly loved due to my depression. Due to them thinking that I was that cultured smart creative and deep thinker, only to find out I had nothing to talk about, I wasn't able to form arguments, wasn't able to debate on topics, hadn't read many books, didn't know anything about art or culture and was simply boring and dumb to them. It's my worst nightmare come true. People ditching and telling me I'm uninteresting. This was NOT SUPPOSED TO BE my life. I deserved to be loved and experience that love with her after years of patience, years of pain and sorrow. I persevered. I don't accept this anymore. I tried to change but it doesn't work. I can't read anymore. My brain is fucked and I've literally lost so many IQ points that i don't understand what people tell me. My brain is too slow. And while reading i forget the sentences i read after a couple of seconds so I can't connect them and comprehend the story. I live in the moment. I can only hold 5 seconds of life in my mind. I lost my creativity. My ability to imagine and see while my eyes are closed.

Oh my god we would have been so perfect for each other. She is my female version. I am her. And she is exactly the person I wanted to be. Maybe that's why I love her so much. And as mad and hurt as I am for the way she treated me, I really can't blame her for not wanting me. I wouldn't want this ""me"" either. But it hurts so much because i know how i used to be. I know how my life would have turned out without the depression. Its so fucking painful. A family member killed himself a couple of years ago and that was less painful. It was shocking but this daily constant pain, this living through my nightmares is unbearable.

&#x200B;

I have become a stupid dumb ass uncultured loser and i deserve to die. I deserve my peace. This is not me. You can have my life. I don't want it anymore. I am in hell and I want this to end.",ceaoml,609.0,0.99,128.0,2019-07-17 09:46:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ceaoml/depression_ruined_my_personality_and_my_mind/,0.0,0.0,2019.0,7.0

19,"In twenty six days, I am throwing a moving away party. I don't have the heart to tell my friends I am thinking about taking my life shortly afterwards rather than go through with my move.","It's strange to me how happy I feel now that I've picked the date. I feel at peace with the idea, but I haven't made any specific plans yet on the method.  


The reasons why I'm suicidal and why I'm moving are really similar. I feel so broken and tired. I've battled mental illness for 12 of the 24 years I've been alive. It's really drained me and robbed me of my full potential. Whenever I seem to find a little bit of calm in between big storms, things come crashing down. 

I'm a high functioning depressed person. I have an active social life. I have a good job. I have some good hobbies. I try to see a therapist and take medication. But deep down, there's a lot of darkness I carry. Nobody knows at work that I constantly question how I should take my life everyday, or if life is worth living. It's the first thought through my head when I wake up. When I've tried to open up to people, they treat me like I'm a burden or a liability. I feel so trapped in a persona that I've built for myself - I put up a facade of a happy and energetic person. I decided to set a date to move to leave everything behind and start a new life. But the big secret I carry is I don't want to start over.

I've really struggled. I've taken countless meds, I've seen a therapist for over three years. I've learned to lie to my boss or people close to me about how I've been feeling. I'm really tired. I tried to kill myself when I was 12 and got hospitalized. I thought that was a low point I would rebuild from. Six years later, when I was 18, my girlfriend hung herself. This year, I got diagnosed with bipolar II. I'm sick of countless crazy side effects from these psychiatric drugs. I don't want to keep having to try to fight this for the rest of my life.

So in 26 days, my friends will all get together for one last party. They'll say their goodbyes, and they'll make peace with not seeing me again for a long time. I think this is the time I'm going to do this. I could move 800 miles away, but that only brings me opportunity to just get hurt again. I don't want to live anymore. I love the people in my life so much, but I can't carry this anymore. I want to die so badly.  


I know this will break some people close to me. That tears me up so bad. But in the end, this is something I need to do for myself.",ca9qp2,527.0,1.0,49.0,2019-07-07 17:58:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ca9qp2/in_twenty_six_days_i_am_throwing_a_moving_away/,0.0,0.0,2019.0,7.0

My sister, later that day, *did* apologize (because mom told her to) but it seemed as if she wasn't even sorry. Her ""apology"" wasn't even sincere. She was laughing, looking away, rolling her eyes, as if the whole thing was a fucking joke.

My mom told the both of us that the situation between us has gotten way out of hand, and wants to do family counseling. My sister started arguing with mom, saying how she doesn't want to make up with me.

So I asked my sister, ""Why are you mad at me?""

Of course, she didn't answer and ignored my question. I asked over and over again, but she didn't answer it.

The next day, I told my therapist that I tried to kill myself and she told me that I had to tell my mom. I told her, and she burst into tears. I also told her about all the hurtful things my sister said to me over the years.

Mom: Why didn't you tell me any of this?

Me: I thought you wouldn't believe me, because you and dad always knew her as a nice person.

Eventually, we had to tell dad about what happened. And for the first time, he cried. I've never seen him cry before. And it broke my heart to see my parents like this.

My mom scheduled a session with my therapist on 7/29/19 *with* my sister. But I'm worried that my sister will start lying to my therapist and will try to manipulate her to make it seem like everything was my fault. But my therapist says that she is trained to not fall for that, since she knows my side of the story.

I was told that her boss was going to be there, too, because she's only involved in a session if it involves *serious* cases, such as suicide.

23,"I told my mom I'm suicidal, she forgot.","A few weeks ago I was doing a few chores with her when I broke down and told her that I hated life and that all I ever did when I woke is wishing something would kill that day because I'm not brave enough to do it myself, she called me ungrateful and I snapped and slapped her (It was wrong and I did apologize after it) she cried and that's where it ended. Today I broke down again and told her I needed help, she told me that I can talk to her whenever I want to Wich I answered ""Don't you remember what happened the last time we talked?"" She said that she did remember, that she remember how I slapped her, when I asked her if she remembers why I did and what we were talking about a that moment she just shrugged her shoulders and asked ""What were we talking about""

I'm crushed and seriously in danger of trying to commit suicide again, if my mom doesn't even remember that her own son wants to kill himself then she obviously doesn't care enough and if she doesn't, who does?

1,Chocolate saved my life,"My last serious suicide attempt was in July 2018. I had booked a hotel in a nearby city for two days for ''a conference'' and randomly packed up so it wouldn't be suspicious to my mom. I didn't want to do it in my room because in a way I didn't want to defile it? I don't know how to explain it. 
My plan was to do it as soon as I got to the hotel because thinking about it and postponing makes it more difficult and I wanted to make sure nothing would stop me. 
I opened my suitcase to grab my toiletries bag that had my pills but when I opened the suitcase, something dropped on the floor. It was my favorite chocolate, 70% dark cocoa with candied orange bits. It had a little heart sticker sticked on the wrapper. My heart dropped and I couldn't stop crying. Eventually I think I fell asleep on the floor holding the chocolate and when I woke up, I felt something I hadn't felt in years. I felt loved. My mom put that chocolate there to surprise me because she knows how sometimes I'll forget to eat when I'm overworked. 
Just wanted to share that with you because I could really use that chocolate today. I really could.",cwpqz4,1440.0,1.0,66.0,2019-08-28 19:43:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cwpqz4/chocolate_saved_my_life/,0.0,0.0,2019.0,8.0

Growing up, I was always a really weird kid. I distinctly remember that I had just seen the world differently. It seemed that my imagination had a bigger play in my life than most. Me and a friend in kind garden would squeeze batteries in our hands and pretend that we were Mario or Pokémon because neither of our families could/would buy us a game console but we were exposed to them by relatives and tv. It was so simple back then and looking back so pure,  but it felt like we were there. We didn’t have what other kids had to have fun so we became those things. As far as I know I was a decent enough kid however when my brother came along around age 4, we would fight, I would hurt him, not bad (typically young brother bs) but still enough to get beaten from my father when he got off work. My father more so was (he is still with us) a rigid, traditionally Hispanic in parenting, angry, regretful person. When he was in the house there was always a strange energy of danger even if nothing was going on. It was better to just stay quiet. This didn’t really work because my younger brother soon learned that it was an easy win when we’d bicker to just cry out loud, our dad would come in, beat my ass and I would curse my brothers name for doing so but alas it would get me to stop. My real last memory of child abuse before my teens is about 15 seconds of my dad putting me in a corner on the ground, telling me if I wanted to fight to put my hands up and when I did to just shield myself he pummeled me with closed fists. I was around 10 years old, maybe give or take a couple years, not sure, I have terrible memory of most my life. As I got older, my brother and I actually started bonding, he liked the way I started standing up to our dad no matter how bad I was beat down. He’s told me i inspired him. My mom btw is/was awesome, but didn’t really do much except yell to stop from the sidelines or leave the room since she couldn’t bear to watch. I can’t blame her, not much negativity felt towards her for I know she unconditionally loves me and that must’ve been a tough and traumatic experience for her as well. Moving forward, I’m a decent student, normally averaging around low A’s my brothers straight A’s if not 100’s, not much of a big deal there, my mom started adding incentives once we grew into our early teens (for every A we got in a semester she’d give us like 10 dollars or something, it was dope so we did well). Through out life I feel like I found connections that I would replace for my fathers love, through friendship. I grew very close and desperately wanted to fit in with my friends. I would spend hours out of the house riding bikes around the neighborhood doing dumb lil kid shit, but it was a really freeing time out I remember. Fast forward, around when I was 14, my brother 11 my mom bought me a bass guitar because I had been getting into random enough Japanese rock from the anime I would watch and to me the bassist was always the most bad ass and going crazy member, my brother came along and she bought him a guitar spur of the moment, figured it would help us bond. It did. It really did and I thank everything in this world for those times that followed because they were hands down the best years of my life. I was a shitty bassist and soon transitioned over to wanting to be a singer and my brother excelled at guitar, going onto be called a prodigy by everyone from teachers, producers and most of the respected music industry people we would eventually encounter. But at the time he was my little brother and being a fresh teen thought it would be wack to have my 11 year old brother in the band. I started a couple bands, the second one introducing my brother in as lead guitar. This was a turning point.

Back to family life, my dad started to realize he was aging and I was starting to gain my testosterone fueled teenage body, this didn’t stop anything, but only extended our fights into actual fights. My dad, a correction officer, doing manual labor his whole life handed my ass to me every time. All while telling me to kill myself and how no one loved me and I was a mistake. Nothing like this was said to my brother, unless in terms of how I’ve manipulated him into becoming just like me. I became a bit of a shitty protector of the house hold, two accounts stick out immeasurably to me. The first being (funny kind of a call back to how my brother would yell for my dad to come) my brother was upstairs and screamed Tyler help dad just hit me. In a blind fury, i bum rushed my dad onto the floor, commanded my brother to hold his arms down and pummeled him in his face, chest, balls, anywhere i could hit before he brother free all while yelling the likes of “it used to just be me, that’s where you should’ve left it”. It was a powerful moment. My father spent the rest of the week walking downstairs like a caged tiger screaming and laughing about how he was going to kill me. ‘‘Twas still a sweet victory. No fear.

I’ll speed up the rest: me and my bro made a band, everyone betrayed us, we made another and took full control of who was in it, wrote all the music, what we looked like, who we recorded with, and what not. With his help i created a two year plan to get signed to a label called Fearless Records. We played metal. It was therapeutic and empowering stuff to play after everything you’ve read thus far. 

We did it in four months.

I got a text by our newly acquired manager that we had been offered a deal by the label of our dreams. I cried and got sent home early. A record that I wrote all the lyrics to and my brother wrote all the music to, all fueled by the hate and distinction of our father son dissonance. It was the biggest victory a small town probably has seen, at least our small town. Every time he said we were garbage, we should try something else, i couldn’t sing and my brother should play something nice. Every time he laid a hand on us, put into songs and we did it in four months! Still makes me proud to this day man. 

Btw, this isn’t a story about my father.
He is not the reason I want to kill myself anymore.

The label fucked us over, made us record 3 different records each time hating something that they previously wanted and we called it quits. Our deal was good n no need to recoup anything, just disband.

This is where whatever is inside me to this day was brought into this life. A foe I don’t know if I can beat this time. Throughout the story so far, I had a flame inside of me. The whole time a purpose to prove. A will to fight. I always told people that I wasn’t sad, I was angry. And the anger forged who I was. A determined, skill ful musician, with the mane of a lion and the attitude to match, a man who did it. But when that all went away. I became a worm, but not yet.

Shit with my dad cooled off, he retired. I’m assuming his job really was the culprit of the aggression and I stopped holding the past against him. At this point I had been a dumbass at points too and figured it was not worth the energy or the negativity of keeping that cloud around. Was he still an incredibly ill informed, ego centric prick? Yeah, but I was a different person now and couldn’t be bothered with it. Most times shrugging off his comments. I had worth now.

Me and my bro made another band with just our drummer from the previously signed act, but it didn’t last long, we did an all over the place EP that was uninspiring yet everyone we showed loved it. Drummer left, became a solo artist, he’s a whole other story. I can’t help but feel as tho I’m responsible for his and my brothers mental state as I’m 3-4 years older than both of them (i was always the dad figure to them).

Fuck it tho, rock n roll, we did it once we’ll do it again. Me and my brother move to Los Angeles California in hopes of creating a new sound within the fusion realm of rap, emo, metal, and pop genres. We moved with two of my friends from NY and got a shitty two bedroom apartment and split the rooms. The other two room mates were supposedly friends for years yet fought constantly, shit talked each other and created this crazy negative space in this 1000 sqft. It was not comfortable to say the least. However the one room mate in specific, targeted my brother, who at this point basically didn’t talk to either of them. (This is point one and point 2 is my confesssion) And then there was me, i had developed an alcohol problem, not that i drank every day or even every weekend. But when i did, i became a different person, i would usuallly drink myself to sleep as well. My brother picked me up from a bar one night and while on his way i began to get robbed. I refused it and tried to buy time and ended up running to his car when he got there. Amped on on about 10 jack n cokes and the adrenaline of potentially dying, i flipped shit on my brother. Cursing him out, saying i didn’t need him, i could pay someone 20 dollars to do what he does, etc. it was awful. And it was the last straw for him. Within the next week or so he packed up, quit his job and went back home. 

I was heartbroken, but covered it up with anger. My other two room mates, if you can believe it, convinced me that i didn’t need him and that he held me back. I thought I’d be okay and he’d come back, i left our room exactly how he left it for months. He didn’t. 

This was the final nail in the coffin for my mental state to date. I spend every night analyzing the past, and i think I’ve learned that at first i created a whole identity to hating my father, then after that i created a whole identity around me and my brothers music career and once he was gone and to this second of typing it, I’m lost. I don’t know what to do. My personality feels like it’s splitting. Some days I’m this really cool extroverted ladies man guy and some days I’m a worm in my bed spending money he doesn’t have on post mates so he doesn’t have to leave the apartment. When i sit down and try to write music, i can, but i don’t feel it anymore. It’s the only skill i have. I didn’t go to a real college because of the deal, I’m not good at anything and I’m not interested in anything other than music. But there’s no inspiration left in me. Nothing really makes me happy anymore. I had a gf, nothing, broke up with her, nothing i have a new one, i miss her sometimes but for the most part nothing, i have written 6 new songs, nothing, i post a photo on Instagram, nothing, i go to work, nothing, i watch a movie, nothing. Everything just seems so pointless now, i don’t see myself as the star i once did. I don’t even believe myself when i sing, or have conversation with people. It’s like I’m watching the most boring movie about someone that i just don’t even care about. I just want him to die. I just want to stop wondering and working and fighting, i don’t want to do it anymore, and i was the relief of death. 

Idk what i expect from this but it was slightly therapeutic, thanks for listening.",cwio6u,788.0,0.99,45.0,2019-08-28 10:02:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cwio6u/my_name_is_tyler_thats_my_real_name_this_is_my/,0.0,0.0,2019.0,8.0

23,"""it will get better"" being the biggest lie ive been told. I desire suicide.","I currently suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder, clinical depression and general anxiety, and would rather abuse alcohol than take antidepressants, which I believe wouldn't help my already 'too far gone' mindset. 
I'm crushed under the weight of the simplest of daily tasks, getting out of bed in the late hours of the day and walking around tiredly with no motivation to get things done no matter how long I've slept, struggling to shower and get myself clean, suffering from loss of appetite some days to completely over indulging other days, or even just sitting up in my bed. 
I lay there for hours upon waking up, lightheaded from crying for hours in the early hours of the morning until I feel sick, staring blankly at my TV which is almost never turned off. 
I never leave my room. I store bottles of water and food by my bed so I can interact with my housemates as little as possible and drink heavily most nights and pass out drunk after hours of Xbox and minor interaction with the outside world.
I hardly have the stomach to face my housemates, ignore every phone call, mute every messaging service I use and reply to people weeks later only to find they have lost interest in staying in contact with me and decide to distance themselves before I would be able to push them away with made up situations I create with them in fear of abandonment. I fear rejection. I push people away before they get the chance to do so to me so I can say I wasn't the one who fucked up even though cutting the ones I love out for no proper reason is the very definition of ""fucked up"".
What surprises people the most is the fact that I am well aware that I have friends.
I am well aware that I have people in my life who love me and care about me so much that they want to support me and see me recover and do something productive with my life.
I am well aware that I need help. 
I am not in denial. 
But I'm made to believe I'm a selfish wreck for wanting to die.
I'm made to believe I'm a dumbass for not getting help, all the offers of support and ignoring them so I look fucking stupid despite telling people I just..can't. I don't have the energy anymore. Like, I just can't.
I had goals in life. I dreamt of a sober, healthy lifestyle surrounded by my closest friends and a loving relationship, not being unemployed and relying on benefits because I'm simply too damaged to work a proper job. Just being happy.
Unfortunately, a life like this is almost impossible for the mentally unwell. Knowing you'll have these illnesses for the rest of your life, risking your relationships with your friends and family, your significant other, and the risk of diving so low that you lose your job and end up in the dirt with nothing left or a substance addiction.
I couldn't tell you what's worse.
So far, I found someone I wanted a long lasting relationship with, we love each other and put up with the rough edges we constantly face because of my mental breakdowns and BPD making me believe he was my partner only to make me feel better about myself and that he never truly loved me and that destroyed so much. He faced paragraphs of my insecurities and self loathing, the validation seeking, the questions about whether he even really loved me and it fucked everything up. We had a 6 month break and things returned to the way they were, but once again I destroyed everything because of the shitty made up situations I made up in my head. I'm deeply in love with this person and I struggle to see it work out anymore unless I fix myself but I'm beyond help and don't know how I would even fix myself at this point. 
I have given up. 
I am tired. 
I wanted to fix myself to prove to him that I could be the best person I could possibly be, love him the way he deserves to be loved, and prove to him just how sorry I am for the drama and hurt I caused him. The verbal abuse, the drunken abuse. I look back at the things I did and I just struggle to live a day to day life knowing I caused so much hurt to the person I've loved so deeply since I met him. The person I would give so much for, to bend over backwards just to see him smile. All I think about is the memories we made together and it aches me that I'll probably never experience these things with him again because I'm so broken. Friendship with this person is hard, and I'm deeply saddened that I can't tell him just how I feel. It has driven me to believing I'd be better off dead so I can't hurt him anymore.
I also wanted to fix myself for my family. My friends. 
For myself. Things could be so good right now if I wasn't such a horrible person, so far all I've ever done is created problems for everyone that I've ever loved/everyone that's ever loved me and I can't stand this life anymore. I'm so fucking sad and I'm sick of hurting everyone I love. 
I am unlovable and don't deserve friends. 
This may be it for me, Reddit, this is the tip of the iceberg but the internet cares little for a complete strangers life troubles. 
I have a strong desire for suicide right now, and believe this is the gateway to solving my problems. 
I don't think anything could save me now.

0,"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_theory_of_suicide), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

2,Reminder: Absolutely no activism of any kind is allowed here. Any day.,"If you want to recognise an occasion, please do so by offering extra support to those who've asked for it, and by being a good citizen of the community, mindful of our tips and guidelines.

Edit:  In response to multiple requests, I'm adding a definition of activism here:  ""campaigning to bring about political or social change"".  That's straight out of the OED, we aren't making any special interpretation of it. **Any post that is primarily about raising awareness or changing perceptions is activism according to the dictionary definition and thus a violation of the community rules.**

Some examples of the most common types of activists posts we were here, all of which are totally inappropriate:  

* Advocating for changes in laws around suicide

* Advocating for change in the mental-health system 

* Advocating for changes in cultural norms or common perceptions around mental-health.  These are often related to specific days devoted to specific causes, e.g. World Suicide Prevention Day

Keep in mind that our mission here is individual peer support.  Any post that's not a request for personal support regarding current experience related to suicide is probably a rule violation unless it has the ""Mod Approved"" flair.",d2370x,1215.0,1.0,124.0,2019-09-10 05:26:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/d2370x/reminder_absolutely_no_activism_of_any_kind_is/,0.0,0.0,2019.0,9.0

9,I tried to kill myself.,"Not today, not yesterday, 9 years ago. No one knows. No one noticed. I took a bunch of pills out of various bottles my family had lying around.

I swallowed some of each, chasing them with a wine cooler. Let a few dissolve on my tongue because I liked the sickening feeling they induced. I thought that would be enough. After a few minutes of nothing happening, I swallowed more. Got dizzy. Struggled to make it to the couch. Passed out. I was passed out in the living room and my family didn’t notice. They walked by me and didn’t notice. I still remember it all vividly and think of it often. I had no regrets. I wanted to die.

My name is Hannah, I'm twelve years old

I love music and painting things and I was here once, too.

things with my family are messy. they want to love me, I think, but things can get in the way. I wasn't what they were expecting, even less so what they were hoping for. I know they'll be okay if they believe that they tried to fix me, and I hope the best for them.

 I hope everyone on here has a moment of luck for them, too, maybe one that ends up saving them from their own hands. Please just try, as hard as you can, because when you're too far gone you'll wish you had.

You are all worthy of happiness. I'm sorry life has treated you like it has, or if you're just somebody who tunes in on here to try and help, you are wonderful and appreciated.

7,I got a gun to kill myself and my parents found out about it before I could do it.,"Hello, everyone. Pretty long rant ahead so grab something if you care to read.

I'm a 17-year-old dude, I live somewhere in North Africa, I've been dealing with mental illness for more than 3 years now. I'm kinda traumatized because of all the bullying I've been dealing with since I was young, I don't really get bullied now but I can get verbally hurt as I can't really deal with the other party due to the lack of my social skills. Anyways, I didn't have any chance to make a good long-term friendship in my short life. Mostly, they get bored of me or I just push them away. I decided to go to a therapist because those problems were affecting me in a very bad way and distracting me from studying. But it didn't help much since the therapist wasn't that good. I decided to cut myself and do other forms of self-harm, whether it's starving myself or purging whatever I ate, etc.. A year later, my parents noticed my unhealthy behavior and decided to take me to a psychiatrist, I was diagnosed then with Schizophrenia and Severe Depression, I began to take medications and they helped me a lot but the side effects were taking away a lot from me, my memory was and still pretty corrupted and I wasn't able to do everyday activity, in addition to blurry vision, vertigo, etc., I was in the last year of High School and exams came so I stopped going to the psychiatrist. I got a really bad grade despite doing my best, I stopped taking my medications cold turkey. I went to a below-average college and my mental state is really declining. I was able to get a pistol but my parents found out about it. My plan was ruined and I'm under some kind of suicide watch. I really can't take it anymore, just everyone telling me to ""Man up!"" and ""A lot of people are going through worse"", I'm also kinda guilt-tripped.

I just came here and wrote this from a throwaway account because no one really listens to me, most of my ""friends"" can't really be relied on, and I felt like taking this off my chest.

1,"3 days ago was my birthday, I should’ve done it but my dog and a redditor saved my life","3 days ago was my birthday. I am getting depressed when my birthday comes since it is supposed to be a happy day, but I know that nothing special will happen.

My birthday was the worst, my friends didn’t even greet me, my boss fired up for some reason that wasn’t my fault and got mad at me, I ate alone and like nobody cares about me. I treated myself a good meal for my birthday, an Italian Spaghetti and Pepperoni Pizza. I thought of that as my last meal, and had cookies and cream ice cream for dessert. I would end it that night, or the day after tomorrow. I evaluated all the important persons in my life if I leave them. My mother would hurt, but I know she can manage. My brother doesn’t even care about me. My girlfriend is just using me since if she doesn’t have me, she’s nothing, and that’s the only reason why I haven’t left her since I know once I did that, she’ll kill herself. My “bestfriend” only talks to me when he have problems but when It is me who has problems, he’s not replying to me so I think I wouldn’t be a big loss for him. 

After hours of thinking and finally decided to do it, I remembered my dog. He would never understand what happened to me if I’d kill myself. I can’t stand the fact that he’ll wait for me to come back after a week, a month, a year, or until the day he dies because I am already dead. I cried and hugged my dog tightly. “You saved my life buddy. You’re the reason I’m still here” I said to him while he just stands there staring at me. 

After that, I just browsed reddit just today and saw something on my inbox. A stranger awarded my last post with a silver. “God loves you. Be easy on yourself.” He said to me. At that moment, I started to cry like a fucking bitch because even if I didn’t know him/her, I felt that someone hugged me and concerned about me. 

To you random redditor who gave a silver (I consider it a gold because of your kind words), I wanted to let you know that it is you who made my birthday special. I love you. 

To my dog, Bay, you’re the greatest doggo of all. Imma buy you all the treats you want. You’re the reason why I’m here. I love you so much.

the next day, my best friend took me out to eat. i told her i almost did it. and she said “i could tell a few days before that you were off. and i didn’t say anything. i’m sorry, i should have. i didn’t want you to feel like i was smothering you.” 

but it just meant a lot that she noticed and that i could talk to her about it.

14,This will get lost in a sea of Suicide notes,"I’m using this to say exactly how I feel cause I know no one will see this. 

The last time I was genuinely happy was when I was 5.. then my grandfather died. I was extremely close to him and after his death things just weren’t the same, fast forward to 7th grade my father whom I was never close to despite living in the same house decided to slowly leave his family for another family and left my mom and I alone, then my mother took him back which kissed me off and caused me to an angry child who didn’t trust anyone... which probably caused me to never have a real relationship cause I never feel good enough and I can never fully trust them. Anyways I was always socially awkward/ shy and didn’t have a lot of friends but I have 3 childhood best friends I can at least say I have but as we’ve gotten older and everyone is moving on with their lives I feel stuck. 

My life began to really fall apart in the fall of 2017 ( my second year of college) when I began to rapidly lose the vision in my left eye due to a condition I have that I didn’t even know about until the year before but the doctors said I shouldn’t worry to much about it, due to the loss of my vision in that eye I had 2 eye surgeries to try and repair it but they didn’t work which shocked the doctors. I took a semester off of school to recover and came back in hopes to finish school, then in February of this year the vision in my right eye began to slowly go away. I had to quit my job and leave school and move back in with my parents to try to “ heal”..

I eventually got a job ( which I hate with a passion) and became stuck... then I got into a car accident and totaled my car so now I’m carless. I want to go back to school and get a new car but I feel like what’s the point if I won’t be able to see in a few months, everyday when I wake up before I open my eyes I think “ am I going to be able to even see”. It sucks because surgery won’t work, I’ve tried the holistic approach too and I’m still just slowly losing my sight. I really took things like that for granted.  My parents put me in therapy and it has caused me to face things but with my looking at the bigger picture I’m like what’s really the point? 


I’ll have 3 days of me feeling like myself and”happy” then it’ll be weeks of me in a deep depression wanting to kill my self or hoping I’ll die. I told my mother I want to kill myself before I go completely blind because I couldn’t live like that ( respect to those that are blind and live cause y’all are strong.. even though y’all can’t see this) so I said I’m going to see how the rest of the year plays out cause I’m not going into 2020 like this, but it’s like when I try to get my shit together nothing goes right, I had my heart set out for this new job and everyone there was like you got the job, the supervisors liked you, the employees recommended you, etc... no call back ( I was supposed to get one yesterday if I got the job) that was my breaking point. 

That job really was a push for me to keep going but now that I didn’t get it I feel stuck again, I feel like I sound stupid and dramatic and I know this is worded horribly but I guess I’m just writing my jumbled thoughts out. I’ve been looking up easy ways to kill myself but I’ve seen that there are none... if I had a gun I’d just shoot myself, I looked up ODing on pills but it’s hit or miss and the miss will fuck you up, I thought about hanging myself but I’m black and I’d feel weird idk lol, I think about driving into oncoming traffic and hoping I’ll die but I don’t want to total my dads car cause that’s his property, I thought about cutting myself but I’ve read that that’s a slow death. 

It’s like why is it so hard to die when you want to but when life is going good then you get sick, or die, etc. I guess I sound like a bitch cause I want to die but I don’t want to feel any pain but I guess I’ll have to feel pain in the process cause afterwards they’ll be no more pain. There’s like so much going on in my head and so much to write but idek what to say tbh even though I already said a lot, all in all I’m just so tired. Tired of crying myself to sleep, crying to work, crying at work, crying alone at home, and crying myself to sleep. I’ve been trying to disconnect myself from people but it’s like I still crave human interaction that’s why I feel like a fraud cause I want to be alone but I don’t to feel alone. 

This whole thing probably doesn’t even make any sense but I’m just writing out my thoughts. No one will see this anyways or even read all of this anyways. At first I was giving myself till the end of the year but now I’m just trying to find the best method to end it.",e0h3wr,472.0,1.0,40.0,2019-11-23 12:11:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e0h3wr/this_will_get_lost_in_a_sea_of_suicide_notes/,0.0,0.0,,

I don’t wanna live because all I do is pay bills. There’s no enjoyment in my life, just constant stress and worry and fear that I’ll end up homeless. 

Everything is a struggle. I have to strategically be late on certain bills so the service doesn’t get shut off but I can pay one thing while I neglect another. Interest on my loans and credit cards makes it so I don’t seem to make progress paying anything back.

0,Raped in front of my girlfriend. feeling like giving up.," 

I don't know what to say or do, I just feel like my life is falling apart.

Three weeks ago My apartment was broken into by 4 strangers, my girlfriend was sleeping over. It was an awful, horrific long night, and she witnessed every single thing. 8 hours of prolonged humiliation and abuse.

These 4 strangers destroyed me. They shredded every bit of self-esteem and sanity I had. After the hell they put me through, they simply left me there. bleeding heavily and stunned. My girlfriend was tied up screaming, but I didn't move. It took me a while to comprehend that this is now my reality and eventually get up.

Weeks later, I am paranoid, unable to look at my reflection without feeling disgust, and I spend my time in my university lectures thinking about ending my life. I didn't tell a single soul about this because I feel so ashamed. I feel pathetic and weak. My girlfriend is the only one that knows, though everyone around has been telling me I've been ignoring them lately and calling me an asshole for it, yet I don't care. I just feel numb. I want to die, but I'm too afraid to say it out loud. That night they not only violently violated me, but they took something from me, a piece of my soul.

Anyways, ever since that night my girlfriend has been acting different. she treats me differently, touches me differently, and most importantly she looks at me differently. A few days ago while we were sitting together, she told me that it's alright if this experience turns me ""gay"" and that we don't have to continue dating. this is coming from a 19 year old girl that has common sense, it all just made me feel really bad. It just reflected how after all this, how disgusting I feel was valid, that I am gross in her eyes now.

Today is my birthday, I turn 20. I bailed on all the plans and decided to spend it alone. I'm sitting at home drinking alcohol and thinking about bashing my goddamn face in. I just feel alone in a way I never felt before. I just never thought this is where I'd be, that this would be my life.

I hope I'm posting this in the correct place, I've only had Reddit when I was younger. thanks for listening for whoever is out there. Hopefully I'll feel better for writing this.

UPDATE 1:
Two of the assailants were caught by the police today. I’ll post a more detailed update in the next few days. 
Thank you everyone for this support.

UPDATE 2:
sorry I’m late with this, I’ve just been going through a lot. I’m gonna try to give everyone a bit of closure on everything that’s went down. 
The four assailants were part of a sex trafficking gang that my shitty dad got involved with and owed a lot of money. I’m not comfortable sharing the details of this specific aspect, but I hope this general explanation is enough. 
Two of them were caught and will be most likely going to prison as they plead guilty to avoid a trial. 
I’m currently trying to get myself together, but things have been getting worse and worse mentally. I’ve been going to gym, jogging and trying my best to not lose it, I didn’t start therapy, but I’m considering it. 

Me and my girlfriend broke up and there’s no bad blood. I just need to focus on myself. 

And again, thank you everyone for the immense support you’ve given me. You have no idea how much it saved me and made me feel a little less alone. Thank you.",e8gjky,2825.0,0.99,350.0,2019-12-09 21:41:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e8gjky/raped_in_front_of_my_girlfriend_feeling_like/,0.0,0.0,2018.0,12.0
1,I’m an attractive white man from a wealthy family. The odds were always in my favor. I think I’m gonna shoot myself in the face.,"I don’t expect you to read this, just need somewhere to vent. 

Here I am again, sitting alone in front of my tiny space heater, trying to find a reason to keep going. It doesn’t help that it’s Christmas Eve. I’m basically a 24 year old virgin and have spent holidays alone for the past 5 years. I remember Bill Burr said at like 39yrs old he stopped going home for the holidays. I envy that. At 18 I went to college across the country to get away from my abusive mother, even picked a college she hated (“it would embarrass [her]”). Speaking of college, I’m still unsure whether I was molested. It’s hard to say when you wake up to some guy in your bed. The not knowing really pisses me the fuck off.

To this day my mom doesn’t think she’s done any wrong. After I dropped out I went back home for a little bit. I don’t know what I expected. A year or two later I move across the country again to get away. Now I am truly and utterly alone. I’m currently on my 22nd or 23rd dead-end job. Honestly can’t believe I’ve lasted so long at this one. I guess I look up to the store manager a lot and don’t want to let him down. I’ve seen a hundred therapists, been on a million different meds, went to rehab for 6 months, and I feel worse now than I ever have. Depression, anxiety, paranoia, they’re all too minor to describe what I feel. Had my first suicidal thought at 9yrs old. At that same age I realized I wanted a girlfriend. It was like there was a hole in my heart. I think I just wanted a female in my life because I hated my mother. But I knew I was too young and figured I’d get one later in life - nope. Never been in a real relationship. I was with a girl in high school for a couple months maybe. We sorta had sex once but I wouldn’t even call it that. Every girl I’ve tried to pursue since either wasn’t interested or I didn’t try hard enough / didn’t have enough experience to understand what they wanted me to do. Doesn’t help that I grew up afraid of my mother and hating her. 

In college I was so desperate to get laid I went on Craigslist Casual Encounters (when that was a thing) but girls from my floor found those pictures and passed them around. That shattered the little confidence I had. That is just one experience but probably the one that most changed my perspective of women. I wish I could tell those girls how much damage they’ve done. Then all my fuckups with girls just added to my pain. Dating apps don’t work it’s like my account is invisible. At this point I don’t try whatsoever. It’s as if I’ve been conditioned to not make a move. And the ironic part is I look like a model (genes, muscles, six-pack), dress well, and I’m actually very smart. The few parties I’ve ever gone to girls basically threw themselves at me and I would freak out, have a panic attack, and then leave. Alcohol didn’t help. I’m not gay. I’m just broken. A beautiful girl might look at me and give all the signs that she wants me to talk to her. She might even come talk to me first. I’ll just shut down. Afterward I’ll get angry at myself, so I’ve stopped going places where I might meet a girl because I know what’s going to happen. I’ve always found it interesting how much I relate to “ugly” guys who won’t pursue a woman because they know what will happen. And those guys take one look at me and hate me. It’s like they’re thinking “man, if I could just trade places with that guy.” Hahaha ain’t shit would change, man. You’d be just as alone and maybe feel worse than you already do.

At this point the only reason I haven’t shot myself in the face is because of my dog. My cat wouldn’t give a shit but I can’t do that to my dog. I just can’t. The sad part though is dogs vibe off you and adopt your personality, meaning he’s gone from an angel to anxious and quick to fight other dogs. So, maybe it’d be for the best if he had a different owner. Can’t exactly take him to the dog park anymore. And I’m sure you can tell how close I am to suicide because I know exactly where to shoot. For your sake I’ll spare the details. I don’t know why I’m writing this I guess the holidays are pushing me over the edge. I just can’t be alone anymore. The girl I like is a coworker who shut me down for a different coworker who went and cheated on her. And now I feel like maybe she’s expecting me to make another move?? I don’t know. But the way I am, I’m not gonna pursue a girl who shut me down. You know how hard it was to tell her how I feel? Couldn’t even do it in person had to send some stupid message. Now I have to see her every day. I guess that’s why you don’t ask out people from work. 

I have panic attacks every night and the thin walls in this ghetto apartment complex do NOT help, nor do the gunshots down the street. I have no one to call. My dad kind of understands what I’m going through but there’s only so much he can handle. Every time I talk to him I feel like he’s about to have a heart attack. My brother says I have an illness that just needs to be treated. I feel like he thinks I just want attention. Obviously I don’t talk to my mom, I actually blocked her. And the suicide hotline?!?! Don’t get me started. It’s like they want you to die. The two real friends I had forgot about me once they found girlfriends. I don’t know how much time I have left, and I always thought I was destined for big things. You’re all I have left, reddit. You and my dog. Shit, the cat probably wants me gone. 

If you read this far, thank you from the bottom of my heart.

EDIT: Thank you everyone, this was more helpful than rehab. And yes I love my cat. He’s actually really interesting, basically a real-life Garfield.

EDIT 2: I think Dave Chappelle said it best when he talked about Anthony Bourdain. That’s why I used that title. I can’t stand when people think I “have it all,” so how can I be so unhappy. Anyway thank you again, everyone. And thank you for the platinum, whatever it means, that made my day.

EDIT 3: I am either delusional or my coworkers read this post. Not sure which is worse. But it really feels like one of them read it and passed that shit along like a hot potato. I hear them talking and I hope it’s just confirmation bias but it sounds like they’re talking and laughing about what I wrote. WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING YOU FUCKS?! More gossip to gobble up? One of the guys here tried to have a real talk with me, “how bad are these intrusive thoughts getting?” I haven’t been acting different at work. Why would he ask me that? I did have people contact me saying they weren’t on this sub but found it just scrolling through r/all, so I don’t know how many people actually read this. I guess it’s possible someone I know came across it. Funny that I care when I’m so close to ending it all. Glad I got it off my chest though, was a huge weight lifted. And the support from you guys was unreal. I didn’t respond to everyone but I read every single message and comment. Speaking of which, you trolls can go fuck yourselves. It takes a special kind of twisted fuck to hide behind a keyboard and say that shit. But it turns out this post helped some people?? That’s such a foreign feeling for me I didn’t believe them. I don’t know why I’m still writing. I just hate being me.

18,I want to commit suicide on Xmas Eve just like my sibling,"My brother killed himself on Xmas Eve  when I was extremely young. I still have very vivid memories of it, and the way my family handled it leads me to believe that it didn't really bother them. No one talks about it or mentions him. They have practically erased him from our family's history. Maybe it's because they were ashamed he was gay. Or maybe they were ashamed that he died of suicide. 

Maybe both.

Either way, I want to join him.. Now that I've grown up, I understand why he did what he did. I understand that he wasn't wrong, and I don't feel like I'd be in the wrong for doing the same... I'd be doing the world a favor.

I feel like my life has done nothing but spin out of control since I was a child. It's been nothing but chaos. I was preconditioned not to ever trust. I was sexually abused and pimped out to my stepdad's friends. My mother stayed with a known pedophile while I was relegated to foster care and group homes. 

I feel like I wasn't ever even just given a fair chance. Yet, I went on to get married once a upon a time. I had two kids. I got a divorce. I started a business. I got my bachelor's degree. I bought a house. 

...And then I became addicted to alcohol. 

I made so many stupid choices leading up to now, and because of that, I now have nothing. My children moved to another state with their father after the courts decided he and his wife were better suited to be their parents. And the courts were correct. I'm a fuck up. There's no telling where we'd end up if they were here, but it would probably be within the confines of a cardboard box. I've been sober for almost this entire past yea, minus maybe four or five total slip-ups.. I thought that might fix a lot of my issues, but it hasn't fixed a thing. 

I destroyed my last relationship. I hurt my partner in countless ways. After we broke up for a month, he begged me to come back, and I swore I'd do better or try to be better. I tried as hard as I could.. but I've had to accept that being a shitty person is just who I am. I can't change that about myself, it's embedded in my personality. I broke him into tiny shards of glass, and all he could do when I tried to pick up the pieces was hurt me back. I turned a good person into a horrible, conniving man...

I can't get the job I want. All of my stuff is in storage and I can't pay the bill before the storage place puts a lien on it and keeps it all forever - even the sentimental items like the gifts my children have made for me. Their ultrasounds. Their footprints from their first day alive... My car is gone now, too.. I can't drive to get to work. I can't drive to an interview. I can't drive to a doctor or a mental hospital. I live in the middle of nowhere, and I have no resources. I can't take on new clients and make money. I've fallen as far down the hole as I can, and there's no way back up.

I've had my friends tell me that I should be proud.. that I should just stick things out, because things will get better. But things will never improve, and I haven't felt like I could tell them to what extent my life has become unmanageable.. 

There is literally no way to return to the life that I worked so hard to build, or to better myself and actually do something meaningful with my art or myself as a human being. I don't have the money, I don't have the resources, and I am too afraid to ask my friends or ""family"" for help. 

I feel like they'd be far less inconvenienced if I just didn't exist. I feel like my kids would only have to face one big disappointment instead of a bunch of big disappointments throughout their entire life. I feel like all of the work I put into becoming a valuable human life was all for nothing. I feel like I am a waste of oxygen and space. I feel like all I do is destroy people, and hurt their feelings. 

I have no one. My mother and I are estranged. My remaining siblings and I hardly ever talk. I'm incapable of nurturing a relationship. I'm incapable of being a mother just like my mother was.

I have nothing left, and I have no more motivation to continue on.

I just want to disappear. I want it to appear that I just left without saying a word. No one would notice, because I have done nothing but isolate myself from everyone. I am so ashamed of my life and what it has devolved into, and I don't want to face anyone or burden them with my problems. I don't want to keep trying to fix something that isn't fixable. 

I'm a fucked up person in a fucked up world. People keep trying to tell me that I have so much to live for - that I have so much talent and potential. People keep telling me to keep trying, but they aren't the ones who have to try so it's easy for them. They don't have to live with me, I do. I hate who I am and who I've become. 

I know that I'm sorry. I cannot even begin to describe the remorse that I feel for all of my selfish behaviors, and my depressed demeanor that just brings everyone down. I wish I had treated everyone better: my kids, my kids' dad and his wife, my friends and my remaining family...

I'm everything that I never wanted to be - practically homeless, with absolutely nothing. I have no personality. I have nothing positive to add to the world. I've become so jaded to the thought of dying - like it's going to happen someday, so why do I (and others) keep trying to delay the inevitable? 

I'm sorry if this seemed rambley. I had considered writing letters to a couple of people, but I figure putting it here - anonymously - would be better. I don't want my kids to know I killed myself... so I'm going to disappear to a place where I will never be found. I don't want to tell anyone about it in case they try to change my mind. I'm afraid they'll think I'm just begging for attention. Or maybe they will think I don't mean what I say... but I really do want to die.

21,Humanity is the worst race to be a part of,"We are like enslaved cows, we are born forced to go to school to ""get education"" so that we can be ""successful"", then we must word 9 hours a day to be able to live peacefully and those who are out of that format are either lucky or homeless. I am too a part of that format. Recently found someone that cares about me(a girlfriend) but i just can find the place in my heart to like her. She is amazing and beutiful yet i cant stop looking at other girls and wishing they were intrested in me. Im stressed as fuck from school and it all doesnt seem worth.
