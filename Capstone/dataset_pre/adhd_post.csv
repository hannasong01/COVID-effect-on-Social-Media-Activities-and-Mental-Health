0,My therapist said something I think might help others,"""In 40-some years, I have treated *many* people with ADHD. And so far every single one, **every one of you felt in their core that there was something just deeply, fundamentally *wrong* with them.** That they were inherently bad somehow, just bad people. Every single one.""

My therapist is in her 70s. She wasn't fucking around. I had never directly expressed feeling that way but fuck, she cut right to the core of me. I've felt this way my entire life. Like I was just bad, inside. Hurtful, damaging just to be around. That if people could see inside me they would hate me too.

Fuck. I feel like something has shifted in my head. I touch that feeling and it doesn't feel real any more. I don't know, I hope even one person could feel like I felt learning that this feeling isn't ME. I'm not a bad person.

5,Accepted to Harvard Law School with ADHD!!!,"I just wanted to share, this sub has been real helpful and relatable, and I just wanted to let you guys know that there is a lot you can achieve with ADHD, sometimes in spite of it, and other times because of it. Clearly, it all affects us differently, and I think plenty of people in this sub have worse symptoms than me, but I think there is a lot of upside to being a creative, emotional, and forgetful ball of energy.

7,"ADHDers need to take ""the third door""","I learned this concept last night and wanted to share.

You can think of success in life like a club we're all trying to get into. Most people will go in the front door. They stand in line, wait their turn, and work their way forward slowly but surely. A select number of exclusive people get to use the back door, the are the people who know the right person, have the right reputation, or could buy their way in. But some people can't get in through the front or the back door, they need ""the third door""

The third door is the unmarked way in. It's a window, a fire escape, a roof exit. It's hiding in the laundry cart when they bring in the linens or disguising yourself and going in the service entrance. It's a combination of timing, ingenuity, and effort, but you can keep trying until you make it in. 

I often need to remind myself that my route to success is different, but that doesn't make it any less real. The whole concept of ""run your own race"" has been reiterated to me so many times but I find it hard to stop comparing my path to others. I have to remind myself: just keep trying things, never stop innovating ways around your problems, fall down nine times and stand up ten. I think I feel my best when I'm in ""lovable rogue"" mode, because I know I don't feel good (at all!!!) when I'm in ""trying to be normal"" mode. 

Find your third door, people. 

And remember, if you get into ""the club"" - you aren't a fraud, you deserve to be there just as much as anybody else.

EDIT: Holy moly this resonated! Please everybody keep sharing your stories and experiences. Maybe we all need to see/remember the breadth of possibility that's truly out there.

10,"ADHD is not ""quirky"", it's a terribly destructive mental illness","When  I see people trivializing mental disorders it makes my blood boil.  Especially when it is ADHD because it hits so close to home. Nobody, not  even my parents could ever understand what is wrong with me. I was a  bright boy, but I simply could NOT focus for the life of me, and it made  me feel so bad about myself because I truly wanted more from my life.

I  remember when I asked people for advice about should I take medications  to treat my ADHD, everyone would keep telling me not to do it, how  those drugs are going to fry my brain, and I'l end up a meth addict or  crazy and how when they have trouble doing something they just breathe  or play some music or go for a walk and rest. And for a long time I  really tried doing everything! But I failed 2 years in university, and  that was the final straw.

I told  myself, I might become insane, or fry my brain completely by the time  I'm 40, but I would rather live 10 years in control, than live a 100  being nothing more than just an observer in my life.

I've  been on Adderall for 2 years now and only after taking it have I  realized just how much I have suffered because of my disease. It took me  so long to be able to forgive myself for all my failiures.

I  even became a much better driver.. Before, I could not focus on  ANYTHING, and it took me so long to get my driver's licence and my  instructor would always complain that I don't focus and I always felt  bad and stupid. I am a much safer driver now.

13,I think one of the worst things if not the worst thing about ADHD is when people around you assume you don‚Äôt care.,"Yes, I‚Äôm gonna forget that I had to clean the kitchen this morning and that I decided to do it in the afternoon when I got home. Yes, I might lift weights in the garage before even thinking about doing that. Yes, I might keep the house a little messy because it doesn‚Äôt bother me as much as it bothers you. Yes, I‚Äôm going to blurt some things out that I didn‚Äôt think through and make impulsive decisions that don‚Äôt make any sense at the time and you‚Äôll have to call me out on them. Yes, I truly understand the inconvenience it brings other people and I wish it didn‚Äôt have to take such a toll on anybody else. But no, it doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt love you. I don‚Äôt forget things on purpose. It‚Äôs not a matter of ‚Äúnot loving you enough‚Äù to remember these things. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt care enough about how my decisions affect others. Most of the time, I can only see so much of the big picture. Most of the time, it takes a great effort to be able to look outside myself and my perspective because there‚Äôs already so much going on in my head. And sometimes, I‚Äôm honestly too tired. From what, I don‚Äôt know exactly. Maybe I‚Äôm tired from metaphorically running up and down a long hallway full of thousands of open doors (I opened them myself of course) that I have to close but each time I close one, another opens. It‚Äôs a wild life, this one is. It sucks that they don‚Äôt understand, but I hope they know I‚Äôm gonna keep trying. I leave you with a few words from The Joker: ‚ÄúThe worst part of having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don‚Äôt.‚Äù

14,Tips for working from home from a guy who has ADD and poor executive function and has still been doing it for years:,"Tips for working from home from a guy who has ADD and poor executive function and has still been doing it for years:
1) make a workplace and ONLY do work there
2) do your regular morning stuff before going to your work place
3) shower, get dressed all that stuff, then go to the work place
4) if you need a break, get up and do it somewhere else, don't open social media in your work place.
5) don't eat food in the work place
6) remove as many distractions as possible from your work place.
7) your work place, if possible, should not be the place where your computer currently is, that is a non-productive place full of bad habits.

9,I think ADHD is bullshit.,"Just hear me out.

I know it's a recognised neurological disorder in the DSM and all, that it impacts executive functioning, emotional regulation and impulse control. I know my brain isn't neurotypical and that my struggles are real.

But at the end of the day, the person who constantly tells me my ADHD is bullshit isn't a family member or friend - it's me.

""You don't even have ADHD, stop making excuses. Stop being so goddamn lazy and just do it. Who do you think you are? Why are you so special you need drugs to help you? Just work harder. You're so undisciplined, it's embarrassing for someone your age. Everyone else can do it. Get your shit together and stop this ""it's my ADHD"" victim nonsense.""

And the familiar, weary, disgusted refrain:

""What is wrong with you?""

I know logically my ADHD is real, and something I experience every day, but I'm still my own worst enemy when it comes to stigma. It's been important for me to realise that.

Tldr; Even if you know your ADHD experience is valid, your biggest critic might still be you.

13,He stole my adderall on the morning of my MCAT exam and I feel like only y‚Äôall will understand how much this F*ed me up,"My ex-boyfriend had a substance abuse problem that slowly flourished as our relationship simultaneously went downhill. Yes his problem originally began with prescription painkillers like many other Americans, but later developed into him taking any pills he came across. I tried to be supportive as he tried (‚Äútried‚Äù) AA, NA, outpatient programs, and I even ‚Äúwaited‚Äù for him 3 months while he was in rehab. This situation happened after his first relapse following return from rehab. 

A few months ago I had a much worse prescribing GP than I do now and she would only get around to sending me my month fill about once every two months, so these pills were carefully taken, and especially precious during the intensity leading up to my first MCAT (medical college admission test, 7.5 hours long) attempt. The morning of my exam I had set an adderall (what I thought was in secrecy) in the container I keep my earplugs on my side of the bed to take as soon as I woke up. 

When I woke up there was no adderall there. I was absolutely 10/10 anxiety ridden and I screamed and cried for him to just tell me he took it so I could stop scraping the floors and searching everywhere, almost late. He SWORE to me, begging and pleading for me to believe him, that he would never take one of my pills on a morning like this. So important. The most important morning for me in our entire relationship. I begged for him to admit it, or give it back to me, and searched the floors, all the way until I absolutely had to leave. No calm coffee time, no morning review, absolute panic-stricken anxiety and anger, nothing else. 

Not too long after this I kicked him out of my house and out of my life for good. He‚Äôs now living in a halfway house in another city. Since his to toxicity was no longer in my vicinity, I unblocked his number. I asked him if he did steal my medication the morning of my exam. He finally admitted that he did, and that he was sorry. 

I can‚Äôt tell if his confession relieves me and the insanity I felt, or makes me hate him a million times more. I‚Äôm sorry for this lengthy rant, and thanks to anyone who read. I don‚Äôt feel like the Narcotics anonymous page or anyone else will understand how frustrating and hopeless I felt other than you guys. To him they were just my upper pills. To the takers, and to much of the world, we are seen as lazy, disorganized, anxious, explosive. Really, I‚Äôm just trying my best to keep up. To follow my dreams even if the expectations required are ridiculous for a person like me. That morning he didn‚Äôt steal my upper, he stole my calm, my serenity, my focus. He stole my confidence. I have no doubt this affected my score. 

After the pandemic, I will take the exam again. I will have my medication and I will not have toxic takers in my bed. Cheers to shitty learning experiences, right?! üçª Love you guys, please stay safe.

Why is this? I think there are two reasons: One, it's sort of the way many of us think and speak. A series of related thoughts or ideas, which somehow are all linked together.

Secondly, long sentences are hard to read because you need to keep the meaning of the entire sentence in the working memory, which is hard. Commas space them apart, and make them easier to handle and ""hold"" in the working memory of the brain.

What do you think? Thanks for coming to my TED talk",gjjd4l,5328,0.99,705,2020-05-14 09:55:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/gjjd4l/it_seems_adhders_write_with_a_lot_of_commas_and_i/,False,False,2020,5

5,When are we going to talk about how utterly over the top and ridiculous neurotypical advice for ADHD and sleep is?? It‚Äôs straight up fucking bonkers.,"Someone with ADHD: I really really struggle to fall asleep at ‚Äúregualr times‚Äù, no matter how tired I am I just can‚Äôt seem to fall asleep at 10 pm!!! But I almost instantly fall asleep any time after 2 am. What should I do?

NT sleep advice: You, someone who cannot conceptualize time in any way whatsoever, need to identify TWO HOURS in advance when you want to sleep and, with your executive dysfunction that makes making decisions at will almost straight up impossible, make the decision to stop whatever you‚Äôre involuntarily hyperfixating on. Then, you, with a focus disorder that makes it so that you have to be doing something at all times, sit and do nothing for 2 hours. You cannot read. You cannot be on your phone. Do not move. Do not talk to people. Just sit and do nothing. If you can‚Äôt fall asleep it‚Äôs because you Did Something and it‚Äôs your fault. Bluelight 24 hours before you want to sleep is the reason. Never look at a TV, Phone, computer, OR let one of these objects be within a 24,000 mile radius of you. Never ever go NEAR your bed unless you‚Äôre already asleep. If you are AWAKE in your bedroom¬†ever¬†you will not be able to sleep.¬†

I want to do the goddamn thing but I **can't** and that's so frustrating it's eating me alive and the guilt and stress of not being able to do it is making it even harder for me to figure out how to do it. 

but no it's always ""why aren't you more motivated,"" or ""I thought you liked \[thing\]"" or ""you're just not making the choices you need to""

I am an incredibly passionate and motivated and ambitious person and it took me until my 20s to actually accept that because I was so used to everyone telling me that I must not **want** things enough that I thought they were right and I was just a smart-but-lazy unmotivated asshole

5,This sub is the reason I fought for my mental health - In less than 3 months I became a 4.0 student and got back into my hobbies,"**EDIT:** Reading everyone's comments that I inspired them to not give up makes me so happy!! I did not expect this post to get so big and I'm extremely grateful for all of the amazing positive feedback! I just want to add that I am NOT advocating for relying 100% on medication and I do still have to put in the work to stay focused and not lose hours of my day. I still have many symptoms of ADHD that I can only control on my own! I am very safe with my medication and try to take an off-day twice a week. As for those still struggling, I'm here for you and hope you get the help you need soon! This was not to rub it in ANYONE'S face but to share my story!!!

For 23 years I was told by psych after psych that ADHD and social anxiety was not a good enough diagnosis in itself, and that I must have something else along with it. I live in a pretty conservative pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps area of the US and was told to exercise, focus, and maybe try meditation or yoga. I was always offered a prescription for Strattera and mood stabilizers with no other options - just take it or leave it. Even bringing up the possibility of trying a stimulant would cause an eyeroll from doctors.

At the time I found this sub, I was ready to give up. I remember crying my eyes out because of all the posts about seeing people doing so much better after trying medication, and wishing that a doctor would allow me to have that chance. The people here motivated me to keep trying and not give up on finding the right care team who would not only help me find medication, but also listen to me.

Every doctor in this area, and even my own family, SWORE that I could not have ADHD. For the dumbest reasons, too:

""You're too smart""

""You're too young to be on stimulants""

""...hyperactivity? You sleep all day!""

""The ADHD is caused by bipolar disorder. Adults don't have ADHD alone""

""I can't give you a stimulant because you could lose too much weight"" (I'm obese though? lol)

and many more...

I didn't give up though. I knew the mood stabilizers and SSRIs were not doing anything. And Strattera was essentially a sugar pill to me. I jumped from doctor to doctor. Each one of them agreeing that I had symptoms of ADHD but insisting that I was bipolar.

I started speaking up for myself. I started reading everything I could about mental health. I was firm in telling them that I did not believe I had bipolar disorder and it made no sense considering I don't have an issue with depression or mania. I started refusing the Strattera, with one doctor even telling me that it could take OVER A YEAR for Strattera to kick in when it still wasn't working after 8 months.

Finally, it happened. I went to a new doctor. She almost laughed at the fact that I kept being diagnosed as bipolar with no real signs of it. She was SHOOK at the fact that none of these doctors offered any other medication for ADHD and that my anxiety was ignored. She prescribed me Vyvanse that day and asked me to come back in two weeks.

My life changed that day. When I first went into her office I was failing school, unable to work, obese, unable to remember anything, all tasks being difficult to complete, picking my skin, constantly being tired, and maladaptive daydreaming for hours a day.

**What happened after medication:**

That Vyvanse, along with finding a care team that listens to me, **got me my first 4.0 ever this past** **semester**, despite COVID switching all my classes to online. It made me to **start eating healthy again**. It made me **enjoy decorating my home and keeping it clean**. It made me enjoy **working out**. It made me wake up **feeling refreshed in the morning**. It made me **realize I'm a fantastic** **programmer**. It got me **back into playing music and video games**. It got me a **cyber security internship**. It helped me **remember to reply to my friends and family, which has strengthened our connection.** Oh, and I **stopped picking my skin for the first time since I was 6 years old!!**

The other who doctors didn't listen to me or didn't ""believe"" in ADHD told me I would get addicted to meth, become underweight, and have terrible reactions to stimulants without taking mood stabilizers or anti-psychotics. They refused to look at my ADHD as a valid diagnosis alone.

**Basically, what I'm saying is to please not give up**. **If you are from a close-minded town, have a family who doesn't take you seriously, or your doctor refuses to try other forms of treatment, there is still a way for you to overcome these obstacles. Stay strong. Pay attention to how YOU feel. Be an advocate for yourself.**

I struggled with these things for years and while it hasn't fixed all my issues (social anxiety is still p bad) it has helped change me into the human I wanted to be. And I'm not even done yet.

8,ADHD has turned me into a jack of all trades but master at absolutely none,"I can‚Äôt not be doing something, with my hands even if I‚Äôm just chilling out I‚Äôm fiddling with something which means I tend to pick up crafts and hobbies all the time. Yet I never stick with them long enough at a time to become really, really good at them. 

Sewing, quilting, crochet, drawing, painting, model-making, woodworking, knitting, printed cross-stitch, coloring, writing, reading, growing house plants, cooking, baking, training my dog, landscaping, gardening, random diy stuff, Magic the Gathering, gaming, etc. I have probably somewhere between 50-100 unfinished projects, books, games, etc in various things spread throughout my house or crammed in a closet that I pick up and put down constantly. For example- I have 5 quilts in progress. One I started five years ago, one four, one eight, one I don‚Äôt even know when, and one is from elementary school. I just feel like my hobbies never fit in with other people who also do them. Sure, I sew and quilt, but half the time have zero idea what I‚Äôm doing and forget half the terminology by the time I pick it back up. Gardening my plants tend to get about halfway through before I forget about them and they die. 

I feel like ‚ÄúJack of all trades, master of none.‚Äù Definitely was made to describe someone with ADHD.  It used to really irritate me that I could never stick with something long enough  at a time to get really, really good at it- but now I‚Äôve just kind of accepted it.

3,Successfully explained ADHD.... GF was FLOORED,"I finally drove the nail home judging by the look on my girlfriend‚Äôs face. Like so many others on here, I‚Äôve tried several times to come up with ways to explain what it‚Äôs like. How this isn‚Äôt just ‚Äútrouble sitting still disorder‚Äù like people think.

If you‚Äôve ever worked retail, you‚Äôre probably familiar with the easiest way to piss off a coworker while they cash out a drawer. Just stand next to them and say random numbers in the middle of their count. The first time it happens to you, you think it‚Äôs kinda funny.... every time after that, you think like Ernie preparing to commit a hate crime. It‚Äôs the end of the shift. You‚Äôve pushed through the sensation of barbed wire wrapped around your throat while dealing with entitled shitlords. It‚Äôs late, you‚Äôre exhausted, and miserable. All you want to do is accept defeat, take the L, and go home to cry. 

I had her do it and after several tries she finally got it. But then I had my roommate chime in and she couldn‚Äôt make it past both voices. And then it clicked; every sound, or visual stimulus, or smell, or intrusive thought is a shitty coworker yelling out numbers. On good days maybe there‚Äôs only 2 or 3, whereas bad days have 10 or more.

4,"""You have no idea how emotionally, mentally, and physically exhausting it is to require 10x more effort and input JUST to meet the standard of effort of everyone around you and still fail at 10x the rate."" THAT is ADHD.","Watching Jessica McCabe's TED Talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiwZQNYlGQI from 2017 and it dawned on me that our frequent and uncontrollable penchant for strings of failures over long periods of time are the result of not being able to recover from this exhaustion before moving on to the next emotionally, mentally, and physically exhausting thing, task, conversation, activity, trip, obligation, appointment...anything.  

Those closest to us need to be reminded of this, especially the non-ADHD (so basically everyone around us, which is also emotionally, mentally, and physically exhausting for me to have to do).

Then comes the somewhat crushing realisation that you just experienced a normal day by most folks standards .

This is just a rant though.

Of course, your productivity should still be celebrated, after all you should only be comparing your present self to your past self... but does anyone else feel a bit deflated when they realise that they aren‚Äôt the fuckin flash, they‚Äôre just not being gripped by anxiety and distraction for once.

13,"I applied to an education in Psychology, 4757 applicants and only 60 spots. I got in! (Sweden)","I finally have something to feel really proud of. Hell even my parents are proud of me and that just doesn't happen. I don't think I've ever heard my mom sound proud like that before yesterday. I've basically lived in poverty for the past 15 years and felt like shit about myself for so long, I think my life is turning around at last. I got my ADD diagnosis at 27, why my countless doctors didn't think to even consider ADHD even though my journal from when I was 18ish stated I had severe concentration issues is beyond me. I'm a girl and not hyper and got good grades, I guess I didn't show the usual warning signs, but still. I'm basically Dory from Finding Nemo.

In Sweden we have a version of the SATs that you can take twice every year, and you can use the score to apply for educations. 34% of the spots avaliable are allocated to people using the SAT score (so 20 spots on the psychology programme), the rest of the spots are given to people with the highest grades. A year ago I did he test and scored higher than 99% of the people that took the test and it allowed me to get into basically any education in Sweden. (You need straight As to get in otherwise and I don't have that.) The psychology programme was listed today in the local paper as the hardest to get into out of 200 programmes at the university of Gothenburg, I feel proud as hell. It's such a strange feeling.

Don't give up people! I'm well over 30 now and I feel like my life is just beginning, it took me a long time to get here and that's okay. We may fall down over and over but if we don't stop trying we'll eventually get somewhere better. For the first time ever I feel hope for my future.

4,Let‚Äôs share life-changing ADHD tips that we‚Äôve learned...,"I‚Äôll start:

1) Waking up sucks. Buy 2 bright lamps and 2 timers. Set them up to turn on automatically 5-15 min before you want your alarm to go off. The lights will help your body realize it‚Äôs daytime.

2) Change your thermostat so the temp goes down about an hr before bedtime and gets warmer about 30 min before you wake up. The cooler temp signals your body to sleep and the warmer temp will naturally help your body wake up.

3) Learn to plan around ‚Äútransitions‚Äù. It‚Äôs easier to start things if you do them when something is ending. Example: Do your grocery shopping every Fri after work. You‚Äôre already in the car, so just stop at the store on your way home. 

4) If you need to remember to bring something with you the next day, place it right in front of the exit door so you HAVE to touch it before you leave the house. If it‚Äôs something in the fridge, put a sticky note on the exit door‚Äôs handle.

5) Have a ‚Äúmisc‚Äù basket in each room. If you‚Äôre truly unable to put something away, put it in the basket. Have a designated period of time, once a week, when your sole priority is to put everything away, all at once.

I‚Äôll add more when I think of them...",ifsln9,4112,1.0,774,2020-08-24 16:44:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ifsln9/lets_share_lifechanging_adhd_tips_that_weve/,False,False,2020,8

9,Maintaining friendships feels like a chore sometimes,"First off, I love my friends and I genuinely enjoy spending time/chatting with them. But like many other ADHD folks, I rarely miss people when they're not around, and therefore rarely get the urge to make plans with them or even randomly write to them to ask how they've been. 

I like hanging out with them, I just don't need a lot of social contact to be happy - a hang out session will usually ""last"" me a long time. Kinda like how a good meal means you don't feel hungry for the next few hours. Therefore they're usually the ones who take the initiative to ask me to hang out. I make it a point to accept unless I really can't, because I know most people feel upset/neglected if you don't see them a lot and they mean a lot to me so I don't want that. Plus, I know I'll have fun once I'm there. To continue with the meal analogy, it's kinda like when you're not hungry but still wouldn't turn down a tasty snack like popcorn/candy. 

The thing is, I tend to always feel like I'm very busy because every task I can envision feels like an emergency. 90% of the time my mind is just a mess of all the things I have to do and it feels like a lot even if to a regular person it wouldn't be that bad. As a result, making/accepting plans with friends sometimes feels like just another thing on my already full & stressful to-do list. I feel kinda guilty for rarely initiating things, and often accept plans out of a feeling of obligation to maintain the friendship. Once I'm there I pretty much always end up enjoying myself and being glad I went but sometimes I still feel the stress of every other thing I should be doing in the back of my mind. It's kind of exhausting. 

I guess that was mostly a vent post but I'd love to hear if others have similar experiences and/or advice.",i73arw,3425,1.0,329,2020-08-10 11:45:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/i73arw/maintaining_friendships_feels_like_a_chore/,False,False,2020,8

12,On transgender and LGBTQIA+ acceptance,"(and broadly, acceptance of experiences outside the western cis het white abled male expectation)

I can't believe I have to actually say this.  Lately we've been seeing an increase in people talking about their experiences as trans, nonbinary, gay, lesbian, ace, aro, or otherwise queer.  This is wonderful and we love to see people finding a community here!  For the most part, y'all are very incredibly accepting and that's why people keep coming here.  As expected though, we've also seen a rise in assholes who can't extend basic respect to people.

A recently deleted (by OP) post had many references to OP's partner using singular they/them pronouns.  OP clarified that this was primarily due to anonymity (and this too is a 100% legitimate usage of singular they/them) but that did not stop people from getting downright *hostile* about the simple usage of they/them to refer to a singular person.  As part of this they spread hate about transgender and specifically nonbinary people.  Bans were extended.  In the English language, singular they/them has existed for hundreds of years.  You're long overdue on catching up.

Other threads have people explicitly identifying themselves and people reacting only to that instead of what the post was actually about.  We do not tolerate any kind of hate against a person for who they are.  We try to have discussions and see if the person is just unaware, but we also do not exist to educate people about queerness.  Bans are given on sight for especially egregious assholery and if a person doubles down on their ignorance.  This is a safe space for people of any gender, sexuality, color, nationality, disability, etc.  Unfortunately we do miss some comments, so we really appreciate when the *report* button is used to bring these to our attention.

The /r/ADHD mod team is diverse.  The /r/ADHD community is diverse.  We will work to protect this and keep people feeling safe here.  We did not choose to be these ways, but *you* have the choice to hate or to accept and there is absolutely a wrong choice.

To summarize: Gay and trans and queer people have existed for the entirety of our species.  /r/ADHD will **not** tolerate any phobia or hate or questioning of people, their pronouns, or their experiences.  Other bannable offenses: racism, sexism, ableism, spreading fear and hate.  This list is not exhaustive.

UPDATE: Thank you all for your support! Mostly, this post was just to comment on the catch-22 situation I found myself in, but I took your encouragement and contacted my doctor's office.   
He is a small practice with just himself, and he is not accepting new patient and since it has been over a year since my last appointment the receptionist was not sure if they could schedule me.  
So, I took the initiative and started looking for a new doctor and one closer to home. (My other doctor is in downtown Seattle, where I work, but I have been working from home since March and will be working from home at least until the end of the year). I found a new place and emailed the admin and get a quick reply stating that they are accepting new patients and asking if I am looking for therapy or medication management. I replied and hopefully will be able to get an appointment very soon.

15,I don't like it when people call ADHD a super power.,"I think I understand why people do it, when a NT person sees a person with ADHD, on medication, on a good day, it can seem like we really have our shit together. On the other side, ADHD fucking sucks and I can see someone with ADHD making that claim to feel a bit better about this awful curse.

It's true that some of us are able to think in different and creative ways that can work out well for us in certain jobs or projects. What many NT people don't understand is that these ways of thinking are advanced coping mechanisms for some really debilitating core issues.

I know you fuckers love a good analogy so here's some equivalent ""super powers"" to help people understand ADHD.

-Having absolutely incredible balance...because you only have one leg.

-Being great at fixing things...because everything you own is broken. 

-Having a really high pain tolerance...because you've always had a crippling headache. 

-The ability function for days without resting...because you have nightmares every time you sleep.

-Being able to run faster than anyone else...because you're constantly being ambushed by wolves.

-Feeling hot no matter how cold it is...because you're on fire.

-Having great night vision...because you've never seen daylight.

I know I should be happy/proud, but I find it hard to be.","I just finished my bachelors of science in biomedical science, with an overall GPA of 3.92. I was able to work full time, and graduate with zero debt. I participated in military duty throughout, and completed 3 different research projects, with one leading to my name on a peer reviewed publication. It took me roughly 8 years of time (not necessarily straight through or full semesters), and why is it that's all I can think about? 

I know I should be proud, but also, I just feel like if I didn't have ADHD I would have finished years ago. I would have accomplished more, I wouldn't have changed degrees 100 times, I wouldn't have gotten in school, then got out, then back, then part time, then full time...etc etc.

I never want to feel like that again. Sorry doc, drug holidays aren‚Äôt going to work for me. Being a functioning human being just feels too good.



Edit: I had no idea so many people would end up reading this. That‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt responded very much! But the variety of responses had made one thing clear to me: I, and everyone else on medication for their ADHD, needs to do what‚Äôs best for them. I think I‚Äôll experiment a bit from here, as many have said a drug holiday helps them. I clearly need to find a balance!",iiqqn8,2949,0.99,538,2020-08-29 11:16:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/iiqqn8/i_went_on_a_drug_holiday_and_realised_i_can_never/,False,False,2020,8
18,"Do you ever wish you were born like a hundred years ago? Before there was so much STUFF being thrown at your brain 24/7, when you‚Äôd just go work on a farm or whatever for 12 hours a day and not have to remember to pay bills or respond to emails...","I can‚Äôt be the only one, right? I‚Äôm at my best out doing things and I think I‚Äôd be so much happier living back before there was the distraction of the internet and netflix, before there was so much *thinking* involved in just keeping up with daily life. I would have so much rather worked on a farm or something (and before someone says I don‚Äôt know how hard it is, I grew up working part time taking care of animals on farms, lived in a rural area, and spent most of my chidlhood working at horse barns or farm-sitting.) Unfortunately in today‚Äôs world you can‚Äôt just do that. Because you have to pay health insurance, and rent, and taxes, and you can‚Äôt just run off and buy/start a farm. Not easily, at least.

I don‚Äôt even care that I‚Äôd have a life expectancy of 30 something because heck, I‚Äôm almost there and I cannot imagine trying to keep up this constant daily struggle of never being *enough* for 40+ more years.

Edit: Right, so because I‚Äôm an idiot I just picked an arbitrary number, not realizing 100 years ago was 1920, because I have no sense of time. Really I probably meant more like 1000 years ago when things were more hunter-gathery. (Maybe longer than 1000 years ago, history has never been my strong suit.)

Also, this was a hypothetical daydream not a serious ‚ÄúI think the past was super amazing!‚Äù No, I am not a straight white man. I‚Äôm a women and I‚Äôm not straight. Logically, I know my life *personally* would have sucked back then.",ieo2if,2928,0.98,590,2020-08-22 18:50:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ieo2if/do_you_ever_wish_you_were_born_like_a_hundred/,False,False,2020,8
19,‚ÄúThe worst part about having a mental illness is that people expect you to behave as if you don‚Äôt.‚Äù -Joker,"It pisses me off that people whose brains function normally expect me to behave as if mine does too when I physically cannot do that. They tell me to stop using my ADD as an excuse; but you see if they would remember it on their own I wouldn‚Äôt have to constantly remind them when my ADD causes me to behave a certain way. 

Oh I‚Äôm sorry my disability is such a hindrance to you, but just try being me for even a day. You wouldn‚Äôt last 5 minutes. And my ADD is moderate. I don‚Äôt even want to think about what those with severe ADHD go through. 

My own family tells me to pay attention, and when I showed my mom an ADHD meme she told me ‚Äúyou should just try harder‚Äù as if it‚Äôs a choice. I got diagnosed 9 years ago and my family has yet to understand what it does to me. They don‚Äôt seem to try to either. 

They always seem to expect me to do things at their pace too, which I can‚Äôt do. It stresses me out. They expect me to just get up and go when I can‚Äôt motivate myself that easily. They expect me to be able to do things within a certain frame of time when giving me a time limit stresses me out. 

I‚Äôm done living other people‚Äôs ways instead of my own.

Edit: I didn‚Äôt realize so many people struggled so badly because of this same exact situation. I‚Äôm sorry y‚Äôall had to go through what you did, but at least we have each other on this subreddit now.

Edit 2: Holy shit I got an award, thank you kind sir/lass for my first ever award on this app. It made my day.

20,"I‚Äôm an introvert by nature, but my ADHD makes me seem like an extrovert, and my awkwardness is a result of my attempt to control the hyperactivity.","This isn‚Äôt really a rant or vent or anything. It‚Äôs more like. Musing. Steam of consciousness. 

I‚Äôm majorly introverted. I don‚Äôt struggle with social anxiety; if anything, the struggle comes from slowing my brain down while I‚Äôm trying to figure out social situations so I can navigate them properly, or just observe. 

However, I also want to talk for absolutely *no* reason. I don‚Äôt need anyone‚Äôs reactions, I don‚Äôt need anyone to even listen. It‚Äôs annoying af, I‚Äôm certain. 

So in groups I end up doing this terrible routine where I try to participate, but then I participate a little too hard. Even though I didn‚Äôt even really want to participate in the first place.

Edit edit: for those misunderstanding, I am not swearing by Vyvanse after day 1 of taking it! I haven't even taken it yet. I simply meant by receiving this diagnosis and help, I feel completely understood and I feel like my life is just beginning!

23,My boss took me aside today..,"..To ask me to stop interjecting in conversations that I‚Äôm not a part of. The guy is awesome and I love the job, but it just triggered all these memories of how people have said the same things in the past. 

At home as a child my mom got mad because she thought I was eavesdropping her phonecalls. I wasn‚Äôt, I was just unable to not hear.

In elementary school I was bullied for being a teacher‚Äôs pet. I wasn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt even like the teacher, I just couldn‚Äôt help myself from answering when she asked the class questions.

In High School my friend had a ‚Äòpoints system‚Äô. He gave me a bad point for every time I interjected in class, and alluded to everyone being annoyed by it. 

My bestie had to ask me to stop cutting her off and to let her finish speaking. I had never realized I was doing it. 

I‚Äôve been kind of.. unpopular in a lot of my workplaces because I‚Äôd do this to my superiors, and I try so hard not to. I work so hard on suppressing it that when I do slip up it means I‚Äôm with people I really really like and feel like I can relax around.

0,I went through 700 reddit comments and collected 131 ADHD pro-tips!,"So there was that awesome [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ifsln9/lets_share_lifechanging_adhd_tips_that_weve/?sort=top) with a bunch of ADHD'ers sharing **real tips** that have changed their life.

I thought it was a great change from most advice on the internet which is written by non-ADHD'ers (and it's painfully obvious that it is).

I read through the 700+ comments and paraphrased, merged and categorised all the tips.

&#x200B;

The 131 tips are split into the following categories:

* General
* Cleaning
* Memory
* Time Blindness
* Distractions
* Getting Things Done
* Emotional Dysregulation
* Sleep
* Relationships
* Work
* School
* Executive Function
* Nutrition/Medication

# General

* Pack things the day before so you don‚Äôt forget \~¬†**(**u/digi-cow**)**
* Don‚Äôt drink alcohol. Causes brain fog and it can negatively interact with medications. Alcohol can even cause ADHD-like symptoms in non-ADHD people \~¬†**(**u/HiTechTek**,** u/beatadhd)
* Do Cardio before you need to do stuff that requires sitting. It helps you focus. \~¬†**(**u/robertaloblaw**,** u/beatadhd)
* Use text-to-speech generators to help you read webpages/books \~¬†**(**u/elliptical_orbit**)**
* Keep things at eye level (Especially notes/todo lists) \~¬†**(**u/asmugone**)**
* Be stupidly early to places just in case you forget something \~¬†**(**u/asmugone**)**
* Stretch once in awhile. \~¬†**(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)**
* Take a deep breath. \~¬†**(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)**
* Take a cold shower in the morning or turn it cold just for 30-60 seconds at the end of your shower. Wakes you up, gets your blood flowing and gets you out of the shower. \~¬†**(**u/Juan_Creamsicle**,** u/beatadhd)
* Get a therapist if you can. \~¬†**(**u/fineandnormal**)**
* If you aren‚Äôt diagnosed: Actually get a diagnosis and a therapeutic programme that works for you. Don‚Äôt spend more time wondering - you‚Äôll still feel like an imposter afterwards, don‚Äôt worry‚Ä¶ \~¬†**(**u/Little_Blue_Shed**)**
* Most important for me has been telling myself all I need to do is floss. Usually you'll end up chaining the rest of your night routine tasks like brushing onto that. \~¬†**(**u/amazona_auropalliata**)**
* Buy a whiteboard to sketch out things when your mind starts going into overdrive. \~¬†**(**u/bkmilli**)**

&#x200B;

>**üåü My Favourite:** Enjoy the journey more than the destination, don‚Äôt be in a hurry to finish something you are doing, but always at least do something small everyday. Life is not a race, rather, it is an accumulation of smaller improvements to oneself. \~¬†**(**u/ksettle**)**  
>  
>*People are in such a rush these days‚Ä¶ You can‚Äôt expect to become a superhuman overnight. Focus on sustainability first and enjoy the journey.*

# Cleaning

* Have a designated spot for every single item (Put it in the same place every time) \~¬†**(**u/BrownShoeJenny**)**
* Have a ‚Äúmisc‚Äù basket in each room. If you‚Äôre truly unable to put something away, put it in the basket. Have a designated period of time, once a week, when your sole priority is to put everything away, all at once. \~¬†**(**u/lexid22**)**
* Whenever you lose something that you ‚Äúput away,‚Äù start keeping it in the first place you looked for it. \~¬†**(**u/FullDisclosureDaemon**)**
* In order to not get overwhelmed when cleaning, remember there are only 5 things you need to tackle: Trash, Laundry, Dishes, Putting things back that have a place, Put things in a pile that don‚Äôt have a place. \~¬†**(**u/mmc09**)**
* If you‚Äôre moving from one room to another, take the item with you that needs to go to the other room. It‚Äôs already on your way and it‚Äôs one less thing cluttering your room. \~¬†**(**u/SweetTeaBags**)**
* If you can afford it: Get a cleaning person; It takes them 3 hours to do what you can do in 3 weeks. While they are there, use them as an accountability buddy and sort out your misc tasks like paying bills. \~¬†**(**u/swarleyknope**)**
* Embrace chaos. Let your brain get distracted when you‚Äôre cleaning. Cleaning dishes and stop spare trash? It‚Äôs fine go clean that and then get back to the dishes \~¬†**(**u/DobbythehouseElff**)**
* Have a dedicated playlist for cleaning. High tempo songs help keep you moving. \~¬†**(**u/DobbythehouseElff**)**
* Do chores before you go to bed. No matter what your routine is, you have to go to bed at some point. You can ‚Äúhabit-chain‚Äù cleaning into going to bed. \~¬†**(**u/bkmilli**)**

&#x200B;

>**üåü My Favourite:** Listen to podcasts/audiobooks when doing chores. My excitement to listen to a new episode of my favorite podcast motivates me to do boring stuff like dishes or laundry. (I personally listen to podcasts) \~¬†**(**u/dani-tp**)**  
>  
>*Cleaning became so easy once I started using a ‚Äúside‚Äù to stimulate my brain. I‚Äôm mostly watching TV shows when I clean right now (this also works for cooking!) .*

# Memory

* Having a tablet like an iPad Pro is helpful for keeping colorful notes. Avoids issues losing notebooks \~¬†**(**u/zombiessalad**)**
* Park in the same place every time when you go to a common place. You won‚Äôt forget where you park that way \~¬†**(**u/gibbousboi**)**
* Keep a spare house key in your car and one outside your house. \~¬†**(**u/GoodGuyVik**)**
* Keep important items in visible and convenient locations. e.g: Take pills when you eat? Keep your bottle beside your table where you eat. \~¬†**(**u/girlabout2fallasleep**)**
* Get a Tile. Bluetooth GPS trackers that are a game changer for ADHD people that lose keys/wallets. \~¬†**(**u/fizzzzzpop**)**
* Tape your most often made recipes to the inside of your kitchen cabinet doors. \~¬†**(Unknown)**
* Three point check when you close the front door: Phone, wallet, keys \~¬†**(**u/cowboyhugbees**)**
* Use voice assistants. ‚ÄúRemind me to do X tomorrow at Y time‚Äù \~¬†**(**u/theviciousfish**)**
* Use the mind palace memory exercise to help solve retention issues. \~¬†**(**u/asmugone**)**
* Keep forgetting your lunch? Put your keys on it. That way you can‚Äôt leave without your lunch \~¬†**(**u/Therealdickbut**,** u/Maktube, u/mismanager)
* If you need to remember to bring something with you the next day, place it right in front of the exit door so you HAVE to touch it before you leave the house. If it‚Äôs something in the fridge, put a sticky note on the exit door‚Äôs handle. \~¬†**(**u/lexid22**)**
* Buy multiple items that you use often. Setup multiple chargers at work/home (so you have a spare if you lose one). e.g. buy 10 different lip balms so you can always find it when you need it. \~¬†**(**u/redbananass**)**
* Have convenient, labeled spaces for things. It‚Äôs hard to forget your phone when you ALWAYS put it beside your charger. (Use a cheap labelmaker!) \~¬†**(**u/TotallyLegitEstoc**,** u/nathanb131)
* Get a tracking tool like Tile and put it on things you lose regularly. (Keys/Wallet) \~¬†**(**u/3GrilledJalapenos**)**
* Have rules for placement of the important things in your life. (it‚Äôs too hard to do it for everything) \~¬†**(**u/nathanb131**)**
* Create a second brain for yourself - in whatever way is most appealing to you. (I personally use Notion) \~¬†(u/significanttoday**)**
* If you want to remember something, put an object out-of-place whilst thinking about what you want to remember. \~¬†**(**u/VectorGambiteer**)**
* Count your steps as you walk into a new room. It‚Äôll help you remember why you entered that room. It gives you something to focus on but it‚Äôs not too much that you‚Äôll get distracted. (This is similar to many forms of counting meditations too) \~¬†**(**u/bethknowsbest**)**
* Use a bowl to throw your keys, badges, and wallet into when you get home. That way you can‚Äôt leave without ALL the stuff you need. \~¬†**(**u/pockunit**)**
* ALWAYS have a bag with the essentials. On mine a have my keys, charger, papers and even tooth brush. If I‚Äôm going out, I do not waste time searching for everything. Just search for a bag. \~¬†**(**u/sdjrp**)**
* Make a calendar entry for every scheduled thing religiously unless it‚Äôs routine like a 9-5 job. Make the calendar entry immediately while making the appointment. Do this for parties, birthdays, dates, finals, med refills, trash night, etc. \~¬†**(**u/percyjeandavenger**)**

&#x200B;

>**üåü My Favourite:** Use Spaced Repetition to study for your exams, remember things about people in your life, and literally everything you can possibly make a flashcard for. \~¬†**(**u/beatadhd**)**  
>  
>*Is it narcisstic to put my own tip as a favourite? Well who cares, it works! Spaced repetition is fantastic and honestly* ***feels like cheating***\*. There are a lot of free tools out there which work great. I‚Äôm currently using my own private tool\* üòâ

# Time Blindness

* Set your phone clock 10-15 mins fast on purpose \~¬†**(**u/Anonredditthoughts**)**
* Put appointments in your calendar 10-20 minutes earlier than the actual appointment \~¬†**(**u/Alyscupcakes**)**
* A schedule is only as good as the alarms and info you put in \~¬†**(**u/asmugone**)**
* Set timers for activites you hyperfocus on. BUT set the timer for X minutes less than the task takes. (Give yourself time to wrap up whatever you‚Äôre working on) Additional Protip: Use this on a watch rather than your phone to avoid getting distracted. A basic watch/smart watch will save your life. \~¬†**(**u/dinamyte519**)**
* Download an app on your phone that chimes and buzzes every half an hour during your awake time. Keeps you aware of how much time has passed. \~¬†**(**u/Frosty172**)**
* Track your time. Every morning, write out a todo list by hand and track the time taken for each task. (Write down the time whenever you take a break or switch tasks) - I personally use Toggl to track my time \~¬†**(**u/ImprovedMeyerLemon**)**

&#x200B;

>**üåü My Favourite:** Get an electric toothbrush with a timer. ADHD people have time blindness and it‚Äôll make sure you brush for at least two minutes. \~¬†**(**u/insaxon**)**  
>  
>*Yes. Two minutes can feel like two hours for me. Or I‚Äôll brush for 20 seconds and think five minutes has passed. I can‚Äôt trust my brain, so I started using an electric toothbrush with a timer*

# Distractions

* Disable all your notifications on your phone except for essential apps (Texting, Voicemail, Calendar) \~¬†**(**u/kee_kee**)**
* Use website blockers for distracting websites *(I use Cold Turkey, Freedom and News Feed removers for social media + Youtube)* \~¬†**(**u/elliptical_orbit**)**
* Get a good pair of noise-cancelling headphones + non-distracting music/audio \~¬†**(**u/elliptical_orbit**,** u/michaeltheobnoxious)
* If you can‚Äôt stop yourself from answering that text/email/IM right away but don‚Äôt actually have time to deal with it, tell the person you‚Äôll respond when you get a minute. \~¬†**(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)**
* Your brain focuses better after some exercise. *Cardio works best* \~¬†**(**u/unofficialuser112**)**

&#x200B;

>**üåü My Favourite:** Use a noise-cancelling headset and listen to music/white noise/brown noise. Enables hyperfocus and blocks out distractions (‚ÄúI don‚Äôt regret getting diagnosed late, but I do regret getting noise cancelling headphones that late in life.‚Äù) \~¬†**(**u/rn7889**)**  
>  
>*Stop scrolling right now and go buy the noise-cancelling headset. A noise-cancelling headset + some noise like music/brown noise is essential if you have ADHD. Feel free to thank me later once your life changes.*  
>  
>*If the headset isn't in your budget: Brown noise + earphones will get you 80% of the way there.*

# Getting Things Done

* If you have an Android: Put a widget from your todo list app on your home screen so it‚Äôs the first thing you see \~¬†**(**u/kee_kee**)**
* Break tasks down into as many smaller tasks as you need for it to feel manageable. \~¬†**(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)**
* Learn to plan around transitions. It‚Äôs easier to start things if you chain them with another task that is ending. \~¬†**(**u/lexid22**)**
* Use the pomodoro technique for everything. It‚Äôs great having a break to look forward to. \~¬†**(**u/ontapeina_sthrnaccnt**)**
* Remember that something is better than nothing. If you only get 26% of a task done then it‚Äôs further than if you never started. It‚Äôs better to do little bits of every task rather than procrastinating. \~¬†**(**u/xxxistentialist**)**
* Attach numbers to events. e.g: Going to bed (3) - Brush, Floss, Mouthwash. \~¬†**(**u/Frosty172**)**
* Lie to yourself. I‚Äôll tell myself that I‚Äôm just going to unload one dish from the dishwasher. Once I‚Äôve started, I‚Äôll at least unload a few, and maybe clean the whole kitchen. \~¬†**(**u/coffeeclichehere**)**
* Decide what you‚Äôre going to do each day beforehand, preferably while your meds are at their workingest. Make sure it‚Äôs only 1 thing. \~¬†**(**u/optimisticaspie**)**
* Understand that FUTURE YOU IS STILL YOU. If you think you‚Äôll do something later, understand that future you is still you. Future you isn‚Äôt more likely to muster up the desire to do the work. f you don‚Äôt have the motivation to do it in the next 24 hours then future you probably won‚Äôt either. \~¬†**(**u/Moon_In_Scorpio**)**
* When you need to transition between tasks, pretend that you are talking to a friend who is having issues with something. Give yourself a nudge and remind yourself it‚Äôs time to switch tasks/get started. (Detach yourself from the task) \~¬†**(**u/Gerryislandgirl**)**
* When you take breaks, make sure your break isn‚Äôt too interesting. That way you won‚Äôt get absorbed in your break. Just clean during your break or something like that. \~¬†**(**u/Treppenwitz_shitz**)**
* Gamify things and set a limited amount of time to accomplish something. e.g: Brew your coffee and get as many chores done as you can before the coffee is finished brewing. \~¬†**(**u/strngrsstpngstngrs**)**
* Write TODO lists as a brain dump. And then order them in importance or the order you want to do them in. That way you don‚Äôt pause while writing down tasks. \~¬†**(**u/strngrsstpngstngrs**)**
* Don‚Äôt be afraid to stimulate yourself if you need it. Listen to a podcast or music to get yourself to do something. \~¬†**(**u/fineandnormal**)**
* Reward yourself when you get things done. Positive Reinforcement is good and you‚Äôll feel like getting more things done. \~¬†**(**u/prince-ali-but-short**)**
* Change your environment and work from a place where there are fewer distractions. e.g: Cafe/library. You‚Äôll get more stuff done \~¬†**(**u/humbled_lightbringer**)**
* Set a time to do work, and a time to relax; that way you don‚Äôt feel guilty about relaxing during the time you set aside for yourself. \~¬†**(**u/talking_face**)**
* Change your alarm sounds/timer sounds frequently, but use alarms and timers as much as possible. \~¬†**(**u/Little_Blue_Shed**)**
* Treat timers and alarms like non-negotiable laws. When the timer goes off, doesn‚Äôt matter what you were doing seconds ago, it‚Äôs time to go. Half showered, wet hair, one eye done, whatever it is, you‚Äôre out the door. \~¬†**(Unknown)**

>**üåü My Favourite:** Body doubling - if you need to do some work that requires focus without much fun, have someone in the room with you. They could be working too, or not. Just having them there makes everything just a little more interesting and a little more accountable. \~¬†**(**u/Creebjeez**)**  
>  
>*I feel like a lot of people are missing some sort of accountability system in their lives. I don‚Äôt do body doubling but I use Beeminder to keep me accountable.*

# Emotional Dysregulation

* Brain dump in a notebook by your bed every night. \~¬†**(**u/ALyscupcakes**)**
* Don‚Äôt feel bad about sucking at school/work. You‚Äôll get better as you learn more strategies for coping with ADHD. Things get better \~¬†**(**u/astrozork321**)**
* Use writing/journaling as cognitive therapy to defuse emotional history \~¬†**(**u/Tman1307**)**
* Remind yourself that the world won‚Äôt end if a few things fall behind. \~¬†**(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)**
* Write a reverse todo-list. Write down the things you have accomplished for the day. That way you won‚Äôt feel overwhelmed and it‚Äôll make you feel better. \~¬†**(**u/SuspiciousEchidna**)**
* You‚Äôre allowed to let things go. Forget irrelevant things and forgive yourself. Ignore the awkward thing you did last week. Life will move on. \~¬†**(**u/bitetheboxer**,** u/optimisticaspie)
* Forgive yourself for your limits. \~¬†**(**u/3GrilledJalapenos**)**
* Meditation. Active breaks for people that struggle to take breaks. Use a meditation app when you‚Äôre starting. Like Headspace \~¬†**(**u/Juan_Creamsicle**)**
* Start working on letting go of shame. It depresses your motivation and only makes things worse. You wouldn‚Äôt shame someone in a wheelchair for not getting things done, your difficulty is in your brain instead of your legs but it‚Äôs no less real. \~¬†**(**u/percyjeandavenger**)**
* Cognitive Behavioural Therapy + meditation **\~ (**u/beatadhd**)**

>**üåü My Favourite:** You‚Äôre allowed to let things go. Forget irrelevant things and forgive yourself. Ignore the awkward thing you did last week. Life will move on. \~¬†**(**u/bitetheboxer**,** u/optimisticaspie)  
>  
>*Stop hating yourself. Don‚Äôt look at the future. Don‚Äôt look at the past. Look at the present. I used to always hate myself for being so unproductive. I realised how pointless that was and I started to focus on improving myself in the* ***present.***

# Sleep

* Put your phone on the other side of the room and make your alarm super loud. Gets you out off bed and will make you turn it off so you don‚Äôt wake other people up. \~¬†**(**u/Valendr0s**)**
* If you‚Äôre having trouble getting out of bed then set a timer on your phone for 5 minutes and chuck it across the room. It‚Äôll force you to get up and turn it off. \~¬†**(**u/PMDicksInTinyClothes**)**
* Buy 2 bright lamps and 2 timers. Set them up to turn on automatically 5-15min before you want your alarm to go off in the morning. The lights help your body know its daytime \~¬†**(**u/lexid22**)**
* Change your thermostat so the temperature goes down an hour before bedtime and gets warmer 30 minutes before you wake up. The cooler temperatures get your body to sleep and the warmer temperatures help you wake up \~¬†**(**u/lexid22**)**
* Use a reminder app for starting your bedtime routine, not just your bedtime. (And have a bedtime routine) \~¬†**(**u/3GrilledJalapenos**)**
* Try setup meetings/commitments early in the morning. They'll force you to get out of bed \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**

&#x200B;

>**üåü My Favourite:** Set two alarms when you get up in the morning. One to get out of bed and one for your medication. e.g: 5:30 AM wake up and take medication and then fall back to bed. By your 6AM alarm you‚Äôll have waken up and your meds will have kicked in \~¬†**(**u/BizzarduousTask**)**

>*What a great lifehack.* *I‚Äôve been doing this the past few days (except I don‚Äôt wake up at 6AM) - it works pretty well. Also I throw my phone on the other side of the room so it forces me to get out of bed.*

# Relationships

* It‚Äôs okay to be in a room with people and just let people breathe. You don‚Äôt need to fill the silence. \~¬†**(**u/asmugone**)**
* When having a conversation or learning something, repeat every word the person says in your head. It‚Äôll help you not drift off as much. It also makes it so you‚Äôll interrupt people less. \~¬†**(**u/TheNocturne**)**
* Try to avoid the word 'but' when faced with a conflict. Instead try be constructive towards arguments/discussions with the word 'and'. \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**

&#x200B;

>**üåü My Favourite:** For maintaining eye contact: Imagine a red dot on someone‚Äôs nose for intense focus. Bridge of the nose for paying attention. \~¬†**(**u/asmugone**)**  
>  
>*Haven‚Äôt tried this one but I used to have trouble with eye contact a few years ago so this stood out to me. I‚Äôm pretty good with eye contact now, but I‚Äôll be trying it over the next few weeks anyway.*

# Work

* If you hate your job. Make a job switch. It‚Äôll help you make positive changes in your life. \~¬†**(**u/Mooberry_**)**
* Find a job that works WITH your system. If you can‚Äôt wake up and be functional in the morning then stop trying. Find a job that doesn‚Äôt need you to wake up in the morning. Stop beating yourself up over things your brains isn‚Äôt designed for \~¬†**(**u/obxunseeker**)**
* Be self-employed and start a business. ‚ÄúNo matter where I worked or what I did, I was constantly watching the clock, hating every single second of it. On Saturday I worked 27 straight hours to finish a job on time and it was still less painful than working an 8 hour shift as an employee. Those 27 hours disappeared and left me feeling gratified because I made someone‚Äôs house beautiful and I got to see how happy I made her the first time she saw her new home.‚Äù \~¬†(u/jake7697**)**
* When promising a timescale to a client, double or triple the amount of time that you initially think it will take. That way worst case scenario, you will finish it on deadline and meet expectations or best case, finish before and exceed expectations. \~¬†**(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**
* The moment you know you aren‚Äôt going to make a deadline, let the client know and again give them an overestimate of time for new deadline. People are always understanding and appreciative for this quick communication. \~¬†**(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**
* Reply to emails and messages when you read them. 99% of the time, days and weeks will go by if you tell yourself that you‚Äôll reply later on‚Ä¶ \~¬†**(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**
* Be honest about your limitations and own your shit. Most people have no idea how much adhd affects so many things and therefore can‚Äôt understand our inability to do basic things at times. Especially if you come across as smart and creative, they can misplace our struggles for laziness and lack of care. If you fuck up own it, explain why and apologise. It doesn‚Äôt have to be long winded but it is important to state how you aim to rectify the situation and again. \~¬†**(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**
* Stop comparing your output and motivation to others and embrace a slower, more considered, creative one. You are not other people. You are you. Trying to jam your freeform, 12 sided shape into the round hole is painful and won‚Äôt work. You don‚Äôt need a hole, you need self acceptance. \~¬†**(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**

&#x200B;

>**üåü My Favourite:** Learn to say no to taking on things that you know may cause you stress and excess pressure just because it‚Äôs money. It is not worth it, just put the boundaries that will save your mental health in the first place and you won‚Äôt have to deal with the fallout later. The more you do it, the easier it becomes. \~¬†**(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**  
>  
>*God yes‚Ä¶ ADHD people have a dangerous habit of overcommitting to stuff. Personally I think I just forget that I‚Äôm already working on X, Y and Z. Sustainability is important - don‚Äôt overcommit.*

# School

* Use Active Recall + Spaced Repetition to study for all your exams. I've seen countless people go from C's to straight A's after adopting them \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**
* If you're finding it difficult to start assignments early then ONLY read + annotate the assignment brief early and go take a break after that. Your subconscious should process the information and it'll be easier to start later on. \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**
* It‚Äôs better to turn in an assignment that is 75% done. It‚Äôll drag your grades down less than if you never turned it in \~¬†**(**u/bitetheboxer**)**
* Print out lectures and powerpoints in advance (ask the teacher for them). That way you won‚Äôt need to listen and write at the same time. You can annotate the printed versions instead. \~¬†**(**u/strngrsstpngstngrs**)**

&#x200B;

>**üåü My Favourite:** Visit your school's inclusivity and disability team. They will hopefully have policies for helping people with ADHD \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**  
>  
>*This is something I never took advantage of while at University, but I probably should have. A few assignment extensions when my meds stopped working would have saved me from countless all nighters‚Ä¶*

# Executive Function

* Setup a morning routine + a reset routine. A reset routine is something you do when you're feeling super unfocused. Mine consists of meditation, exercise, journaling, playing music and making some tea. \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**
* If it takes less than ten minutes to do the task, just do it immediately. \~¬†**(**u/Zzazu**)**
* Have a uniform for work, social and casual scenarios. Don‚Äôt mix your work clothes with your casual clothes. \~¬†**(**u/3GrilledJalapenos**)**
* If you start to feel frustrated for no reason, eat something and keep yourself hydrated. (Self-care flowchart) \~¬†(u/enjakuro)
* it‚Äôs better to half-ass most things than it is to not do them at all. \~¬†**(**u/coffeclichehere**)**
* Set alarms using music rather than the default alarm sounds. It‚Äôll help you get going. (And music releases norepinephrine in your brain!) \~¬†**(**u/redditraptor6**)**
* Make yourself kits for common repeated household tasks. e.g: Cleaning Kit, Package mailing kit‚Ä¶ Reduces the friction needed to get started on a task \~¬†**(**u/sonjavalentine**)**
* Refine your routine and rituals to reduce the overall time it takes to get them ready. Reduce the friction needed to start your morning routine. e.g: Prepare a filled pot of coffee the night before. \~¬†**(**u/lazyoracle**)**
* Set just a few non-negotiable standards and laws for yourself. Pick those that improve your life the most. e.g: No phone in bed at night or in the morning. Not even a quick email check. And read your goals every morning. \~¬†**(**u/AllsFarrin**)**
* When you‚Äôre trying to get started on a task: Write down the steps you‚Äôve already done and the steps you plan to do next. Helps a lot with spaghetti thoughts \~¬†**(**u/qui_gone_Gym**)**
* Drink a big glass of water when you know you are going to have to start doing a thing in a bit. When you inevitably have to go pee, start after you wash your hands. You are already up and your brain already had to switch gears. Use it as momentum. \~¬†**(**u/percyjeandavenger**)**

&#x200B;

>**üåü My Favourite:** On tough days. Use the 1-thing theory. Just try and accomplish just one-thing for that day. e.g. Clean the kitchen. \~¬†**(**u/soggysocks63**,** u/GoodGuyVik)  
>  
>*A bit less life-hacky compared to the others but I‚Äôve found that getting started is a lot easier when you only have a single priority.*

&#x200B;

# Nutrition/Medication

* If you are Vitamin D deficient then take Vitamin D supplements (see a doctor first). It‚Äôll help your mood and energy levels. \~¬†**(**u/ImprovedMeyerLemon**)**
* Eat lots of protein and stay hydrated. \~¬†**(**u/chlordane_zero**)**
* Figure out if you're deficient in anything and try fix those things. This includes getting a food allergy test, figuring out deficiencies and eating a healthy diet. \~¬†**(**u/beatadhd**)**

&#x200B;

>**üåü My Favourite:** Use a 7-day pill organiser with AM/PM slots and put your medication and supplements there. \~¬†**(**u/ImprovedMeyerLemon**)**

3,"Read this today; ""Some individuals with ADHD, especially without hyperactivity, have an activation problem as described by Thomas Brown, Ph.D. in his article ADHD without Hyperactivity (1993)""","""Rather than a deficit of attention, this means that individuals can‚Äôt deploy attention, direct it, or put it in the right place at the right time. He explains that adults who do not have hyperactivity often have severe difficulty activating enough to start a task and sustaining the energy to complete it. This is especially true for low-interest activities. Often it means that they can‚Äôt think of what to do so they might not be able to act at all, or, as Kate Kelly and Peggy Ramundo say in *You Mean I‚Äôm Not Lazy, Stupid or Crazy?!,* they might experience a ‚Äúparalysis of will‚Äù (pg. 65). ‚ÄúThe clothes from my trip‚Äîa month ago‚Äîare just still lying in a heap in the suitcase.‚Äù ‚Äú*I spend a lot of time in bed watching TV but my mind isn‚Äôt watching TV.

This is so wrong from someone who is a doctor, there is a difference between a healthy person taking Adderall and someone with ADHD taking it and doctors definetly do not give these drugs easily, the procedure for getting approved for stimulants is quite long and complicated. And I've heard people with ADHD that actually slept better on stimulants than not. I just don't like this stereotype of all drugs being bad no matter what, his show is popular and has consequences, Dr. Phil as he's a doctor should know better than to come out with such a topic, his show is watched by millions of parents who have a hard say in whatever their children receive treatment or not.

34,"Friendly reminder if ADHD is inhibiting your functioning to the point that it consumes your life, there is a way to help you","ADHD is a spectrum disorder. If you have a lighter version of it, you can form coping mechanisms to deal with it and succeed in life. For many people, this is sufficient. 

However, if you have a more severe case of the disorder, there is no amount of coping or behavioral management that can properly help your situation on its own. Examples of symptoms of severe ADHD that can greatly harm your quality of life:

- can not read or pay attention to anything for more than a few seconds. It is impossible to maintain concentration on nearly everything, no matter how important it is.
- memory retention is terrible, so bad that your functioning in school/work is negatively effected and harms performance significantly. This also leaves you open to being taken advantage of in business and relationships. 
- mind is more than easily distracted or cloudy; for many the mind is a tornado of noise that you have no control over. You can‚Äôt control a single thought in your head or visualize anything. Life almost feels like a dream and everything is unclear. This contributes greatly to depression symptoms from ADHD, since your mind is fighting against you and dimming the world around you.
- any attempt to focus your concentration with a lens is met with extreme resistance from your brain, to the point of almost pain. 
- hyperactivity that makes it impossible to function normally or stay still. This can get to extremes for some people, greatly hurting the ability to function in work, classes, and social gatherings.
- hyperfocus that destroys your awareness of your surroundings. This can be especially dangerous for things that require you to snap out of a haze such as driving. 
- fatigue and exhaustion that linger throughout most of the day. This is far more common than most think. Additionally, many with ADHD have trouble falling asleep and do not wake up feeling refreshed, so sleep schedules are impossible to keep.
- you ability to judge time is terrible. You will miss appointments, due dates, and responsibilities without a clock in front of you at all times. Having no internal clock can do a lot of damage to one‚Äôs relationships and overall quality of life.




If several of these issues impact you greatly and they are caused by ADHD, you should not despair. Despite the stigma against it, the best solution and quickest way to relieve these symptoms is medication. If these issues are strong enough and consistent enough to greatly restrict your ability to function in life, it means that you need to go to the doctor and get on a medication that will give your mind what it needs to function properly. There is no shame to using medication, if you need it. Many of you are scared of using it or fear the stigma it creates, but the reality is that if you relate to the above issues, you are needlessly suffering. I can guarantee that if you are suffering from ADHD that is this bad, there is a cocktail of medications that will make you feel better. They work, and odds are, one of the first ones you take will help you and change your life immensely. The stimulants especially work quickly, so you will know if a medication works for you in a matter of weeks to a month and can try another soon after if you notice no benefits or harsh side effects. Additionally, don‚Äôt accept less than the best, since you deserve nothing less. If medication only helps a little bit and you still have problems, there are different dosages, combinations, and medications that you can take to work with what your body needs from you.

Your most important priority is your health. For many of you, that priority is being ignored. If you need medication, take medication.


TLDR; Take medication if you need it. Don‚Äôt feel like you need to struggle through symptoms every day when you can treat these issues properly. Meds can be the difference between a life of depression/stress and a life of happiness/achievement. They can save your life.",itb1jv,2562,0.99,447,2020-09-15 15:29:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/itb1jv/friendly_reminder_if_adhd_is_inhibiting_your/,False,False,2020,9

4,"ADHD is weird cause when people ask me ""Did you try your best?"" At the same time I can't say that I did, because I couldn't bring myself to do what was asked, but at the same time I had intent, I tried to start so many times, I sat at my desk looking at the thing I had to do and just... Didn't...","It's like, the words on the paper stopped making sense, it just... Idk I try and try to do things but you know when people say like ""my mind is too buzzy, I'll try this later"" or ""I'm too tired now, I need to get some rest"" I feel like this, but when I am entirely rested. It's not a physical thing, is mental. I just can't... And when people ask me things like that I feel bad for myself, I wanna say that I did but then they'll show me how easy it was, thinking that's the part I have difficulties with, and I know it was easy that's not my problem, my problem is my fucking brain there is something wrong with it, but people won't understand that if I don't pull out a half hour lecture about how ADHD works and even after that they'll tell me I can't use that as a shield to not do homework or cleaning, or washing the dishes or... I KNOW. I'm not using this as a shield I just... 

I'm starting to understand _it_ now, this, invisible enemy that has been sabotaging me my whole life. It's something new for me, I'm discovering now why I am this fucking mess, it's not... The problem isn't new. Knowing what the problem is, is. 

But I've been through that so many times so I know all that, I know all the ways I can answer that question and the repercussions that this will bring me.

So I tell myself that this is the last time this will happen, that the next time will be different, that I'll do better, that I know better, that I can do it... Just to finally resign. Because I know I've been through that too. I had this conversation with myself time and time again.

""... No"" I answer

""Do you... Need help? Maybe you could go to a psychologist or a psychiatrist, I know its hard sometimes but things will get better, I trust you. I'll be talking to your parents about that, alright? Well go through that together""

5,‚ÄúHere‚Äôs something that happens to ADHD children a lot: Getting pushed beyond their limits by accident. Here‚Äôs how it works and why it‚Äôs so bad.‚Äù (From a Tumblr post linked below.),"Child says, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this.‚Äù
Adult (teacher or parent) does not believe it, because Adult has seen Child do things that Adult considers more difficult, and Child is too young to properly articulate why the task is difficult.

Adult decides that the problem is something other than true inability, like laziness, lack of self-confidence, stubbornness, or lack of motivation.

Adult applies motivation in the form of harsher and harsher scoldings and punishments. Child becomes horribly distressed by these punishments. Finally, the negative emotions produce a wave of adrenaline that temporarily repairs the neurotransmitter deficits caused by ADHD, and Child manages to do the task, nearly dropping from relief when it‚Äôs finally done.

The lesson Adult takes away is that Child was able to do it all along, the task was quite reasonable, and Child just wasn‚Äôt trying hard enough. 

Now, surely Child has mastered the task and learned the value of simply following instructions the first time.

The lessons Child takes away? Well, it varies, but it might be:

-How to do the task while in a state of extreme panic, which does NOT easily translate into doing the task when calm.

-Using emergency fight-or-flight overdrive to deal with normal daily problems is reasonable and even expected.

-It‚Äôs not acceptable to refuse tasks, no matter how difficult or potentially harmful.

-Asking for help does not result in getting useful help.

EDIT 2: someone pointed out this clarification, that it‚Äôs not a wave of Adrenalin but a wave of serotonin:

‚ÄúThe adrenaline release is a physiological response to stress and is responsible for the heightened emotions and arousal, but serotonin mediates the behavioral response. Once that response is initiated, the heightened adrenaline will cause stronger memory consolidation, causing the child to learn to do that task only when subjected to an intense stress response, as well as causing avoidant behavior toward that task at all. The rest is on point though.‚Äù",jbpfhp,5500,1.0,565,2020-10-15 15:14:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/jbpfhp/heres_something_that_happens_to_adhd_children_a/,False,False,2020,10

11,"Do you ever feel like you are an adult that needs a ""babysitter"" all the time otherwise if someone isn't there to make you do things, help you do things, you'll never get much done?","I (31F) accidentally hired a babysitter for myself for a couple hours a day for the past couple weeks because my husband was looking for someone to come and help with chores. He has OCPD and needs things to be meticulously organized before he can function at his demanding new job. We both work from home since the start of the pandemic so initially I had volunteered to just do the chores and for him to pay me instead. However this arrangement never worked because the entire pandemic I couldn't be consistent with it and just let things go to disarray (of course) before I did anything. If there were 10 things on a list to do daily I'll do 2-3 and feel very productive. So in the end he was doing the rest of the tasks on the chores list (doesn't help I thought they were ridiculous in the first place).

So he went online to find a cleaner to come everyday for an hour or two to help with the chores. I initially protested to this because to me ""we didn't need it"". So the past couple weeks we have a girl come everyday. Now I protested because I don't like to sit around while someone else is cleaning up after me when I feel like I can do it myself (on my own time and very inconsistently), so I've been just telling her to just assist me with the tasks. So she's been babysitting me for 1-2 hours everyday and I've never been so productive.

House? Sparkling clean. Bed? Made every morning. Groceries? Done and put away in the pantry and fridge immediately. Dishes & utensils? Unloaded from the dishwasher and stowed away into the cupboards. Laundry? Done and folded immediately. Cats? Happy that we are less stressed out and aren't fighting all the time. We've also managed to cut down on food delivery because I now have the energy and enthusiasm to cook. 

I always thought that perhaps I didn't do much because I had no motivation, energy, or time. But it turns out I needed someone else (not my husband) to push me the right way to do things on my own and help when I can't. At my job I still struggle because I'm alone and I dictate what I do with my time (eg won't get much done until the last minute) and don't have anyone to work everyday alongside with.

Since hiring the ""adultsitter"", I have so much more motivation to pursue weird new hobbies (I want to take up bushcraft so I can pretend I'm a hunter gatherer at least for a few hours). I realized being an adult with ADHD in our society can be very lonely, because we are expected to be able to do things on our own, when really humans evolved to be social creatures. If you can afford to get someone to watch you or even just accompany you to errands you absolutely hate/feel anxious about, get that adultsitter!

18,The way ADHD meds work is super interesting to me. Here's something really cool I've noticed.,"Maybe this is something super obvious but I'm new to ADHD and the meds so I was really fascinated by this!

I am 26F and my grandma has been teaching me how to knit. Knitting is actually pretty cool, but it's moreso an excuse to hang out with my grandma. At the end of each row she'd have me count my stitches to make sure I didn't accidentally add one or lose one. 

Before meds I'd count the stitches and if there was any kind of background noise I had to restart midway. I'd always recount them too because I usually made mistakes. I would really have to put energy into focusing on it, and I had to touch every stitch with my finger to be sure I counted it.

On meds, and I don't know how to describe it, but I can count stitches accurately and really quickly. I don't have to even touch the fabric. My eyes just count the stitches and there isn't any mistakes. It's easy.

It's almost like having ADHD is like having someone in your brain shout other numbers when you're trying to count, and on meds, that person shuts up.

What interesting things have you noticed?

29,"Guard your minds, there be gaslighters afoot","""I just want to be normal""

A common sentiment, especially for people with ADHD.  Our memories fail us, executive functioning is all out of whack, and we just seem to struggle more than the people around us.  It sucks.  And we automatically learn how to hide it, by masking.  We smile and nod through conversations when we can't process them in real time.  We take emotional cues from other people when we're not sure how much is appropriate.  And we rely on other people's memories to fill in the gaps when our own memory fails us.

But there's a danger to doing this too.

People who don't trust their own memory are prime targets for gaslighting and abuse.  It starts off small. Your friend unexpectedly announces that you'd planned to meet up with them today.  You followed all the instructions your boss gave you to the letter, but now he says that you did it all wrong.  A collegue made a bad joke at your expense and is now telling you you shouldn't be so sensitive about it.  And these are all things that people with ADHD do genuinely do - we forget, we are bad at planning, we take rejection to heart.  But if you feel like in a certain environment your ADHD is magnified more than normal, start being critical of the people around you.

Did you really plan that meeting?  You have no record of it on WhatsApp, where did that idea to meet come from?  
Your boss said that the way you've followed the instructions is all wrong, but he was never clear about them in the first place.  
And check in with a friend - was that joke out of line?  Get a second opinion.  It might not be you being overly sensitive.

Don't be afraid to trust your own memories over what others tell you.  Don't be afraid to challenge the narrative they're trying to feed you.  If it turns out they were right after all, no harm done, you tested a situation well.  Its better than feeling like your ADHD is out of control around oddly specific people, and you're going insane.

Tl;Dr: ADHD makes you a prime target for gaslighting.

But, speaking? Transcribing abstract thoughts in my head into a series of sounds that I can‚Äôt even guarantee will be interpreted by the listener the way I mean it? *But then also having to do that shit live?* I can‚Äôt even recall what I said 10 seconds ago, let alone keep track of my thoughts in real time in such a way that ensures that the thing I‚Äôm trying to convey comes out the way I mean it. 

I think it‚Äôs at the root of some of my greatest anxieties in life, and is something that I dwell upon every single day. In any spoken interaction, I know that all it takes is a single moment where my mouth moves before I can ‚Äòreview‚Äô my own words. And then it‚Äôs too late.

In most day-to-day interactions, the consequences tend to be pretty benign ‚Äî until they‚Äôre not. I live in a constant fear of that; the persisting fear of mindlessly saying some stupid shit that‚Äôll ruin my day, or weekend, or whatever. And so instead, I‚Äôve learned to stay shut as much as I can. People typically think of me as being the ‚Äúquiet type‚Äù, and in a way I certainly am an introvert ‚Äî but I don‚Äôt necessarily want to be. I‚Äôm just locked in my own head.

But then there‚Äôs the *non*-day-to-day interactions. Those real important ones. Like having a crucial talk with my advisor about my research, where I need to be sharp and on top my wits and prove that I know my shit. Or in really important, ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù discussions with my girlfriend, where I need to communicate deep emotional thoughts whilst knowing that every word I say could carry a mountain of weight to it. Or god forbid, trying to speak to an audience, when every 20 seconds I get distracted from speaking by spontaneously becoming aware of the fact that I am, in fact, currently speaking. In these contexts, I‚Äôll either become completely incoherent, or find myself ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù in my own mind, unable to form words. And it‚Äôs the absolute worst.

I sincerely don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been able to communicate any of this to anybody before. And I think a big reason is *because* of how difficult communicating things can be due to this.

9,"Everyone talks about how ADHD can produce short-term paralysis, but it's the long-term paralysis that really scares me","ADHD-induced short-term paralysis is real. You can't get started on something because your brain's going a mile a minute, and the thought of having to discipline your thinking produces a wave of dread that can quickly overwhelm you. I get it; it's a regular thing for me, and probably for most people on this thread.

But less attention is paid (no pun intended) to the long-term paralysis that can result from ADHD: when you're unable to plan for the future because your interests are in a constant state of flux. In order to make progress we need to commit to goals, and in order to commit to goals we need a baseline level of emotional stability ... but ADHD can remove that stability. It can make you feel like disaster is perpetually imminent, so your struggle to avert disaster becomes the only objective you have time for.

Over time this can really knock your self-confidence. The irony of having ADHD is that I'm open-minded but incredibly short-sighted. I take things one week at a time, and my primary objective at any given moment is simply to 'keep it together'.

1. I did not do this on purpose, I chugged water for 4 days before I realised what was happening. I have no data for whether it will work on purpose. Please share your results with me, for science.
2. Yes 2-3L is a lot but I'm from a very hot/dry place, my medication gives me dry mouth, and my body weight is higher than average.
3. Why on earth are people downvoting comments that are just agreeing and saying ""hey, nifty""? Stop that.

27,"It's said people with ADHD have no filter, so I built a dam.","I tried to improve my personality, and even that wasn‚Äôt good enough, according to my grad school advisor

I was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult when I first started grad school. I never had trouble in school as a child. But after learning a lot more about ADHD over the last year, I realized that so many of my insecurities are rooted in my ADHD symptoms.

It isn't exactly a confidence booster to read a 'list of 10 annoying personality traits' and walk away with what might as well be an excerpt from the ADHD section of the DSM.

I‚Äôve always hated my personality (or what I called my personality) and tried desperately to pinpoint what exactly it was that I was doing wrong and change. I hate that I‚Äôm loud, talk way too fast, accidentally interrupt and intrude, can‚Äôt sit still or listen, can‚Äôt be patient. And over time, I started hating myself for all of those reasons. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be able to think of myself as anything but annoying and obnoxious, and I spend a lot of my time trying to regulate my behavior with willpower alone.

Don‚Äôt talk too much. Don‚Äôt say things people aren‚Äôt interested in. Don‚Äôt come on too strongly or overwhelm anyone. Don‚Äôt get too excited or eager for things. Sit down and listen. If you say something at all, make sure it‚Äôs relevant, necessary, and eloquent. Don‚Äôt ask unnecessary questions or ask for help with stupid things you should know how to do. When in doubt, just be quiet so you don‚Äôt bother anyone.

And fast forward a year of trying not to get in anyone‚Äôs way in grad school, I receive feedback from my advisor that I don‚Äôt have a personality. They don‚Äôt know what to think of me or whether or not I really ‚Äòfit in‚Äô with our cohort because I‚Äôm pretty unreactive and don‚Äôt show too much emotion. I‚Äôm too hierarchical and incapable of being informal around people.

And what am I supposed to reply to this? Should I make my advisor breathe a sigh of relief by letting them know they wouldn‚Äôt want to deal with my personality anyway? That I‚Äôm saving them a lot of grief?

And what am I supposed to think of all of this? Apparently, I have two settings: loud and annoying or aloof and rigid.

I‚Äôve pushed myself into this corner where I only like myself when other people like me. I had a good day when I didn‚Äôt annoy anyone. I had a bad day when I talked unnecessarily or wasted someone‚Äôs time. But now, it‚Äôs not just enough to not be annoying and have people like me.

It‚Äôs said that people with ADHD don‚Äôt have a filter, so I fixed that problem by sealing it all off by building a dam. And I don‚Äôt think I know how to be selective with what I let flow through.

It feels like I‚Äôm playing a game, but I don‚Äôt know the rules. And I don‚Äôt even want to win; I just want to earn some points here and there for the things I manage to get right, which isn‚Äôt often.

I don‚Äôt know what joke I make is going to end up being a charming and clever remark or be taken as rude and uncalled for. I don‚Äôt know whether a story I‚Äôm about to tell will be genuinely interesting or a boring time-waster. And a lifetime of trial and error hasn‚Äôt led me to figuring this out any better, so I just stopped telling jokes, stopped sharing stories, and figured I can‚Äôt possibly lose if I just refuse to play.

First off, I want to thank everyone who took the time to reply to my original post. It gave me so much of what I needed to build the strength to let my current doctor go. I have a telehealth visit with her on Tuesday and planned on telling her that I will be finding a new doctor. For some reason, I'm extraordinarily nervous, but know I need to do this AND tell her why.

 Incidentally, I took my 4yr old to the pediatrician today for her flu shot and found out by accident that our beloved doctor is family practice and I can see him too! I even specifically asked him if he's comfortable treating with patients with ADHD and he said yes! He even talked with me about how misdiagnosed people with ADHD are with depression and he said ""I've had so many patients come in thinking they're depressed when in reality they have ADHD and they're just depressed because they can't get s*** done."" Like he ACTUALLY gets it.  And he has known  me for YEARS as person not just as a patient. And my oldest is medically complicated so he knows us WELL. I'm so excited to have someone I really know and really really trust as MY doctor. I have a feeling I'm never going to be accused of drug seeking again!!  I want to cry!

I‚Äôve listened to multiple ADHD books that suggest ‚Äúchore swapping‚Äù with a friend. I‚Äôve had this idea to ask my mum if she‚Äôd be up for it for weeks but was convinced she would think it‚Äôs a stupid idea, but I finally asked her the other day if she‚Äôd be up for it and she was!

I have my assessment on Friday (low key terrified I will be told I‚Äôm just lazy/anxious/depressed and be prescribed another antidepressant) and my mum is almost has ADHD as well, although is in a little bit of denial.

So I called her the other day and proposed this:

1. At least 4 days a week, we will visit each other for 1 hour at roughly the same time, pending appointments.

2. We will not be upset if the other person is late and we only have an hour - if we‚Äôre late, we get less time. We will expect each other to be late so we aren‚Äôt upset.

3. We both have to be doing something, even if we don‚Äôt feel like it.

4. We will set a timer for an hour, with a reminder 5 minutes before the timer is up.

5. At the start of the hour we‚Äôll set ‚Äúgoals‚Äù for the hour and keep each other on track.

6. We can help each other with anything - it‚Äôs not limited to cleaning. The example I gave my mum on the phone was that I‚Äôve been struggling to start my tax return, so I just need someone to be there and keep pushing me to do it.

We had our first power hour yesterday and it was AMAZING. When my mum arrived (10 minutes late), I told her I had 5 people I had been meaning to pay back for various things, and that how dirty our laundry was was stressing me out. So she made me sit down and I wrote a list of who I had to pay back while she started the laundry.

She called out to me a few times from the laundry to make sure I hadn‚Äôt got distracted.

After I‚Äôd finished paying everyone back, I got up to help her with the laundry and she asked where our mop was. I said it was broken and I‚Äôd been meaning to order a new one, so she suggested I order it right then and there, so I did!

Once I‚Äôd finished that I neatened the entire house. I like to play a game in my head where I pretend I‚Äôm a realtor getting a house ready to be inspected but I only have a short time and can‚Äôt actually ‚Äúclean‚Äù anything because it‚Äôll take too long, I just have to make each room ‚Äúlook‚Äù good from a distance.

When the hour was up, the house was so tidy and the laundry was spotless. Today I‚Äôm going to visit my mum and we‚Äôre organising her pantry because it‚Äôs been stressing her out, and I‚Äôm so excited!

When my boyfriend came home he couldn‚Äôt believe how neat the house was and noticed the laundry right away. He asked me how I‚Äôd got it all done and I, shyly, told him about what I‚Äôd read in all the books and the arrangement with my mum, thinking he‚Äôd think it was stupid.

He (in a nutshell) said ‚Äú...wow. That‚Äôs actually a really smart idea. You know I‚Äôd do that with you if there‚Äôs anything I can help you with.‚Äù

I just feel so warm and fuzzy and accomplished today and I wanted to share! Hope you guys get something out of this tip and have a friend or family member you can try it with :)

**TLDR - I‚Äôve organised a ‚Äúpower hour‚Äù with my mum 4x per week where we effectively swap being each others ‚Äúlife assistant‚Äù for an hour each day, 4x days a week.**

*EDIT: oh my god, I didn‚Äôt expect this to get so much attention and I can‚Äôt wait to (definitely forget to) go back and respond to everyone!! Ahh! Thank you so much!*

I thought I‚Äôd let you know how our ‚ÄúPower Hour‚Äù went today - I visited her and she decided that the pantry wasn‚Äôt stressing her out nearly as much as picking something to wear for an event on Saturday. So she tried on all her outfits and I helped her pick one, then we went only and picked some shoes for her to go buy, then we went through her calendar and picked a good time for her to go get the shoes :)",kdtohx,4584,1.0,147,2020-12-15 20:24:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/kdtohx/paid_5_people_back_that_ive_owed_money_for_like_a/,False,False,2020,12

‚Ä¢ when I‚Äôm having problems forming words because my thoughts are moving too quickly and getting jumbled: ‚Äúok, slow down, take a second, think about the words you want to say. I‚Äôm not in a rush.‚Äù

10,"Emotional Dysregulation should be discussed as much as loss of focus with ADHD, if not more.","Since my diagnosis and subsequent therapy/treatment, I've been able to identify **how little I'm actually in control of my emotions and how frequently my emotions flare up.** I was diagnosed late(\~25 y/o) and looking back at my childhood/teenage years, there were **hundreds of instances of my emotions running wild without me being able to control them**. During this time, I was able to manage a 2.0-3.5 GPA but **my social life was tumultuous and frightening**. I **lost a lot of trust in those around me** because I thought they **just didn't care as much as I did**, or because **I thought I hadn't done anything to deserve the treatment I received**. 

I only wish the aloof, lost-puppy-looking stereotype of ADHD **also included the inability to regulate emotions**, as I think that's one part of ADHD that is **known to some but not most**. It's also a piece that **can be misinterpreted by outsiders as a short temper, or a weak spine, or wearing your heart on your sleeve.** I wish that, one day, non-ADHD folks **could recognize emotional dysregulation alongside loss of focus as symptoms of ADHD and not a lazy, emotional slob**. Maybe it's just me projecting my insecurities, but it feels like the combination of symptoms is often **mistaken for willful lazy assholery.** 

Now that medication is helping me with the focus part, the next step(and the harder part imo) is **learning to identify when my emotions are beginning to control themselves** and **how to co-exist with them**. My new goal is to **re-develop healthy social habits** and **the ability to reach out to find new friends.**

12,I can't. I fucking can't.,"I'm so behind on all of my classes. I genuinely cannot fucking focus enough to do anything by myself. My teachers always tell me shit like ""just break it down into manageable pieces"" or ""just do a little bit to get started."" I can't. That's the thing. I can put the paper in front of me and the pencil in my hand, and I can't do it. I'll go through each and every app on my phone individually, stare out the window while listening to music, draw, write stories, anything except the thing that I'm supposed to be doing. I will literally do anything and everything except for work. I fucking can't. I literally just can't, and I don't know why. I have to be doing something more. I have to be watching a video, have to be listening to music or scrolling through social media, because there's always something more, something new. I can't stay interested in homework for more than a millisecond. You could put a god damn gun to my head and order me to work, and you might as well just pull the fucking trigger right then and there because I still wouldn't be able write my stupid essay, or complete my chemistry lab, or finish the hundreds of math problems missing. It's been like this for years, and it's worsened pretty badly these past couple months.

I always have to be stimulated. I have to have something more. I have to be occupied, be interested, be entertained. School doesn't do any of that. Homework doesn't do any of that. You know what does? Social media, youtube, etc. All the bad things. I eat that shit up until it rots my brain, and then I get more. I write stories where I pour out everything locked inside my head. And all the while, my grades continue to slip from As to Bs to Cs to Ds to Fs. And I fucking can't. I fucking can't. I've literally hurt myself over this shit. I'm so fucking frustrated and tired.

And here I am, sitting here at 2:30AM, with a 4:50AM alarm set on my phone for morning practice, knowing tomorrow's gonna be hell because I'm up so late, and my head's spinning and I can't see straight and I'm so tense that my muscles hurt. And I'm up in the first place because I have to get this stupid APCS test finished so my teacher can grade it so the rest of the class can review it and move on, and I'm holding everyone back, but I can't. So I'm here on reddit instead, furiously typing out every single bottled up feeling that's been screaming inside me for the past three years, while I feel more and more like shit as every minute ticks by because I. Just. Can't.

20,"""I like you better when you're off your meds""","My boyfriend, his brothers, his mom, and I were all going to a drive-through light show near my house. His brothers were being very rambunctious, we were packed in a very warm and stuffy car, and needless to say I was feeling very overstimulated. The brothers kept getting out of the car and running around the lights, which made me really nervous. I suppose his mom didn't mind, but my boyfriend and I did. I think she took our discontent with the brothers' antics as being scrooges. I was particularly annoyed because when I'm overstimulated, I get really pissy and that in of itself annoys me so it's a never-ending cycle.

At some point, the mom just turns to me and says, ""you know, I like you better when you're off your meds. You're more fun that way!"" The ironic thing is that my meds had worn off at that point. That WAS me off my meds. If they hadn't worn off, I might've been able to handle everything better. I told her, ""Well, my meds have worn off by now so..."" I don't think she heard me.

My meds make it so I can remember things, I can read better, I can articulate myself better, I'm not so angry all the time, and I'm way more confident in myself because my meds help me do the things that I know I can do despite my ADHD. 

This is not to say that the person I am without my medication is a bad person. They are the same person. My unmedicated self is not unlikeable and broken. I'm not obligated to be unmedicated or medicated to please other people; I'm medicated because it helps me function in this weird world where disabilities and mental illness are seldom taken into consideration or met with empathy.

Women with ADHD are 8x more likely to attempt suicide, while men with ADHD are 4.5x more likely; parental violence and substance dependence increase the prevalence of suicide attempts.","[https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/uot-oif121520.php](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/uot-oif121520.php)

I‚Äôve included some paragraphs I found interesting below. 

University of Toronto

Manuscript DOI: 10.1080/13811118.2020.1856258

A nationally representative Canadian study reported that the lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts was much higher for women who had ADHD (24%) compared to women who had not (3%). Men with ADHD were also more likely to have attempted suicide compared to men without ADHD (9% vs. 2%)

Because ADHD is more common among men than among women, little research or clinical attention has focused on women with the disorder. In this study, women with ADHD had more than twice the odds of suicide attempts compared to men with ADHD.

Adults with ADHD who had been exposed to chronic parental domestic violence had triple the odds of suicide attempts compared to their peers with ADHD who had not experienced that childhood adversity. Parental domestic violence was defined as ""chronic"" if it had occurred more than 10 times before the respondent was age 16.

‚ÄúWe speculate that violent parental conflict may cause extreme stress for the child with ADHD and predispose these individuals to mental illness and suicidal thoughts.

31,Letter to my boss I‚Äôll never be able to send. You fired me because my reaction to new ADHD meds sent me to hospital. Twice. You literally suck.,"Hey you. You suck. 

You‚Äôve let me go because ‚Äúit‚Äôs been twice where I haven‚Äôt shown up to work and you had to call around looking for me‚Äù. 

I got nurses/paramedics to call you an hour PLUS before my shift started. Both times. You didn‚Äôt pick up until an hour after my shift would‚Äôve started. BOTH TIMES. 

But you know this.

Both of these times, as explained in both discharge letters, were UNEXPECTED. I could not have foreseen almost having a heart attack the day before it happened, these meds are designed to help me. 

Again, you literally know this. 

You know my dad hits me, you know I now don‚Äôt have a home because I couldn‚Äôt live around him anymore. You know I had to fight to get a government payment. 

You know that payment depends on how many hours I work. I need a certain amount of hours a week to get the payment and you know that. 

You let me cry on your shoulder the day after I left my dad. You said you‚Äôd support me. You fired me over text and won‚Äôt pick up my calls. You didn‚Äôt tell any of my coworkers or the kids that I take care of. You didn‚Äôt even let me say goodbye to the fucking kids. 


All in all, you suck.

32,Being stopped during chores to accommodate neurotypicals that don't understand is so frustrating!,"""stop cleaning and come sit down for dinner, you can continue cleaning afterwards"" is SO annoying to hear.

My mum really doesn't understand that I can't just switch my 'cleaning bug' on and off. Once I've hyperfixated on cleaning, that's all I want to do until it's done. If I have to stop to do something else, it'll likely be days until I can return to it. 

The worst was yesterday, I went to take down the Christmas tree (a really tedious task given how many ornaments are hung on it) because I was in the mood for it. She said I shouldn't take it down so soon because SHE was enjoying it (this is the same person that wouldn't let me put it up until December because it was ""too early"").

I told her that I was in the mood to do it and if I left it until later it would become a really tedious chore that she'd have to pester me into doing. She just couldn't understand. I even asked that she help me take it down when I'm inevitably not in the mood for it since she's the one that I'm leaving it up for. She just said ""hopefully if I have the energy"" which only annoyed me more because I know I won't ""have the energy"" but will have to do it anyway. 

Anyone else get frustrated by this? Normally mum is really good with ADHD stuff but she just can't seem to grasp this!

This system (US) is a vicious cycle that constantly works against us. 

I‚Äôm allotted a 30 day supply of adderall. I can‚Äôt request my refill early because it‚Äôs a controlled substance. The ANP that prescribes my adderall wants to see me at least once every 90 days. 

I can‚Äôt afford this. 

I‚Äôm going to have to come off of my meds simply because I can‚Äôt afford to see a doctor once every 90 days. Yes, I have insurance. I still cannot afford it‚Äîfinances are very very tight now. The prescriptions are cheap! I can afford my drugs but I can‚Äôt afford the doctor that goes along with them.

But it's really easy to feel like a dumbass with ADHD. I have all the equipment in my brain to utilize my intelligence and a drink baboon in charge of directing it.

1,"When you buy things, pay the ADHD tax upfront.","I've seen a lot of posts about the ADHD tax-- the late fees, the groceries that go bad, lost items, impulse purchases we never touch... you get the picture.  It's real, and it sucks.

One thing I've noticed lately, though, is how sometimes, you can get away with paying a smaller ADHD tax if you plan ahead when you buy things.  Hear me out.

1. I could buy a whole crown of fresh broccoli for like, $1.50, but I won't get around to washing, cutting, and preparing it.  A $2.50 bag of pre-cut, pre-washed broccoli will get eaten.  Instead of a $1.50 ADHD tax for broccoli I won't eat, it's a $1.00 tax for broccoli I will eat.
2. A cute planner or notebook with a great layout is worth $30 if I will actually use it.  An awkward-to-use planner that I'm not motivated to ever touch is useless, and not worth spending even $5 on.
3. With vitamins, if they're not gummies, I won't maintain the habit of taking them.  I'll pay extra for the gummy vites that I will use versus the regular ones I will waste.

Other things include: paying for Spotify Premium because I know that ads (or going to find music elsewhere) will distract me.  Only buying clothes from stores with really long return windows, even if it's pricier (REI lets you return things for a full year, bro).  Paying more for a phone with a really long battery life so it's not dead half the time.

 As someone who was raised to be frugal, a lot of this stuff feels kinda shameful almost?  But when I stop and think about it, I stand by my assessment that it's actually cheaper this way.

Edit: thank you!  but please don't spend money on awards.  spend it on pre-washed, fresh cut broccoli, pals

Edit 2: Y'all make some great points.  The encouragement and understanding in the comments is making my whole week.

After some further reflection, some things really stand out to me:

1.  Viewing willpower and energy as limited resources is critical.  Purchases are cost + willpower + energy.  Whole, unwashed broccoli is lower on cost but higher on willpower and energy demands.  

-> I feel like we can punish ourselves for wasting time.  Like I convinced myself ""don't buy pre-prepped veggies if you're gonna waste 8 hrs on video games, you can spare the time.""  But that's basically punishing myself for having ADHD by depriving myself of vegetables I'd actually eat. 
 
-> Besides, maybe the 20 mins I save by having pre-prepped broccoli means I have enough mental energy to wash some dishes after I eat, which means washing dishes on Saturday takes 40 minutes instead of an hour, which means I have enough energy to clean my room, and so on.  

2.  Frozen vegetables & fruit, meal kits, and bulk purchases help.  I will also add: did you know you can freeze bread??  Then toast it and it's good!

3.  Point of caution: spending more on something doesn't necessarily mean it's more likely to be used.  We have all been there.  But if something will genuinely be more usable or more functional at a higher cost, it might be really worth it.",l4ybvt,8811,1.0,701,2021-01-25 21:41:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/l4ybvt/when_you_buy_things_pay_the_adhd_tax_upfront/,False,False,2021,1

Every night I can't pull myself away from the computer, it's late and I know I should go to bed I'm even verbally telling myself to go to bed but somehow there's that part of me that thinks oh just one more YouTube video then I'll be happy enough to go to bed or just one more Reddit scroll, one last snack, one last game, one last research dive on pointless shit that I'll forget instantly after reading it.

What's even crazier is that I'm aware I am doing this, I am talking to myself out loud about going to bed as if there are 2 of me and I'm making a deal with the other guy, making sure he's satisfied that enough fun stuff has been done before going to bed.

I know the book ""go the fuck to sleep"" is aimed at small annoying children but if you listen to it, can easily sound like it's being read to an adult with ADHD.

3,‚ÄúIndividuals with ADHD can derive so much pleasure from the planning itself that they believe they‚Äôve been committed to the action as well...,"‚ÄúThey feel in control when they see the schedule they‚Äôve devised, and they equate the time spent drawing it up with time spent carrying it out.‚Äù

This book I‚Äôm reading is really eye opening. I wasn‚Äôt aware that this was one of the reasons I‚Äôm so bad at getting things done. Plus, it‚Äôs amazing to realize I actually spend more time planning things than getting them done!  

This book also discusses productive procrastination. We tend to procrastinate something important by doing things that also have to be done but aren‚Äôt as important. Now that I‚Äôve seen this explanation I can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt realize I was doing this sooner.

7,My coworker's substitute tried to blame her racism on having ADHD and I'm still mad and need to tell someone,"TL;DR, my coworker is from Syria, and the woman substituting for him tried to blame her racist comments about him on her ADHD. 

So my usual coworker is a guy from Syria, he's really nice, works hard, and he's generally a very chill dude. He just doesn't speak the language that well yet. We've figured out a way to communicate though, so there's no problem talking to each other. 

A few days ago he was sick, so my boss sent out a substitute to help me at work. She was a white woman, a little older than me, and seemed pretty nice. Everything went well, until lunch.

While eating lunch, we were talking, and the subject suddenly fell on my coworker. She started saying that he's probably a ""lazy immigrant"", ""doesn't do shit"", ""won't even learn the language"", shit like that. I quickly shut her down because I don't tolerate that shit.

And she had the AUDACITY to say ""oh, sorry, my ADHD makes me a little racist""

To which I replied ""no, it doesn't""

And she asked me ""I'm sorry but you don't have ADHD so you can't say anything about my condition""

And I answered with ""I have ADHD as well, it doesn't make me racist. You're just a racist who happens to have ADHD""

And the topic got changed so quick.

I'm still so mad about it. There are too many bigots who blame their bigotry on ADHD. It puts everyone else in a bad light.",ksbsi6,4860,0.99,334,2021-01-07 11:52:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ksbsi6/my_coworkers_substitute_tried_to_blame_her_racism/,False,False,2021,1

So I‚Äôm wasting my time, sitting in bed, dreaming about who I want to be, who I even could be, if I just could get my ass out of my freaking bed. But I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve already spend so much time of my life sitting around while I actually wanted to do something else, something productive but I just couldn‚Äôt. 

I see other people like constantly doing stuff and it feels like a joke to me, a movie scene, because my reality is maybe on average doing something for 2 hours of the day, the rest of the day I‚Äôm to overwhelmed or exhausted to do anything.

I was raised to believe that many of my adhd symptoms were just a result of general laziness, even though I was paralyzed by and severely depressed because of my executive disfunction. So shortcuts of any kind were frowned upon, and I always thought people who purchased precut/prepared foods at a premium were spoiled and lazy (and I worked so hard to not be seen that way, so I refused to do so even if it meant wasting and throwing away expired food frequently. Or losing weight and being nutritionally deficient because I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to prepare real food).

WELL this week when I went grocery shopping I bought a bunch of precut/pre-washed fruits and veggies, pre-cooked flash frozen salmon, and frozen microwaveable rice. I could cry I feel so relieved and validated. I didn‚Äôt feel bad about it once - I walked through the aisles floating lol. And my week has been SO MUCH BETTER because of it!

12,"Emotional dysregulation is the WORST when you are on vacation with your family and just trying to have fun, but instead you just feel irritable the entire time for no reason.","It sucks because I hype up this trip for a long time, and planned on enjoying myself the entire time and relaxing. Instead, I feel uncomfortable because I‚Äôm sleeping somewhere outside of the house in an unfamiliar environment, constantly tired, and quietly getting annoyed by everything my family says or does.         
The worst part is, I know this is wrong. My parents are just having fun and I‚Äôm getting annoyed at them for no reason, and I‚Äôm in a really nice hotel, so I should feel grateful. I can‚Äôt say anything to my family because i don‚Äôt want to sound spoiled or anything. I just with having ADHD would prevent me from fully living in the moment.          
Also I‚Äôm not saying that all vacations are stress-free or that NT people never get irritable. But for me, this happens often with multiple trips, so clearly ADHD is creating larger issues for me.      





Edit: Thanks for all the upvotes and rewards! I had no idea this was such a widespread thing that specifically happens to us during vacations. To me, I just thought this was just me continuing to feel irritable during vacations, but you all opened up my eyes and made me realize it might actually be the vacation itself that is causing it!

16,"Don't worry about where items are ""supposed"" to go in your home. Keep them where you're most likely to use them - even if it means sunscreen in your underwear drawer.","Just because everyone keeps cleaning supplies under their sink, doesn't mean you need to. Put things where you're most likely to use them, even if it's super weird. This helps you A) remember you have it, B) remember to use it, & C) put it back since it's in a convenient spot.

A lot of organizers say to put an item in the first spot you'd think to look for it, but that's ignoring the fact that you'd have to actually remember to think of it.

* If you forget to put on sunscreen or take your meds in the morning, keep them in your underwear drawer, not your medicine cabinet.
* If you're constantly using a screwdriver to open your kids' toys in the living room, keep it in your living room, not in the garage.
* If you always forget to clean your dining room table, keep your cleaner & paper towels in there, not under the sink.
* If you struggle with meal planning, keep your recipes for the week printed out in your fridge, not in a cabinet.
* If you forget to take menstrual pain relief, keep it with your tampons, not with your other medicine.
* If you always forget to use crock pot liner bags, keep them inside your crock pot, not with your other plastic bags.
* If you have a bottle of cream of chicken soup you've had for a year & keep forgetting to cook with, keep it on your kitchen counter until you use it.
* If you forget to bring your lunch in the morning, keep your keys in the fridge.
* If you forget to put your socks on in the morning, keep them by your shoes by the door, not in the dresser.
* If you always forget to put on deodorant, keep some in your car.

Obviously don't go too crazy & start hiding all your stuff where you'll never remember it, but I've started doing this for a few of my things here & there & it really helps.",kv9t1c,3697,1.0,290,2021-01-11 19:21:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/kv9t1c/dont_worry_about_where_items_are_supposed_to_go/,False,False,2021,1

Part of me is worrying that I'm seeking diagnosis as an excuse for being lazy, disorganized, and unmotivated. It was reassuring to hear that someone who lives me thinks I have all the hallmarks, even if the point she ended up making was not the one she meant to.

19,Rewinding movies cause you forgot to WATCH THE MOVIE and then forgetting again,"If i am watching a movie, tv show, or news briefing, I often miss something so I have to rewind it and see what happened. But then I still forget to watch/listen for that thing and I have to rewind again. I don't get this! What is my brain even doing after I rewind? I have zero drive to listen for that thing despite just rewinding. I have sometimes rewinded up to 4 times. I end up concluding that it was just not engaging enough for me to figure out what happened there. I actually want to know what happened, but the lead up didn't contain enough that interested me.

This is especially awkward when watching a movie with others. Was rewatching Breaking Bad with my husband last night. So this is a show I've already seen but I remember like nothing! Something important happened, but as usual, I forgot to watch TV while WATCHING TV!! So I ask my husband to rewind. Whoops, forgot to watch AGAIN. Rewind again. Forgot to watch. I pretend I didn't understand what happened and need to see it again when really I just forgot to watch again. One more time. Yup. No idea what happened, didn't watch it. I now have to pretend I saw what happened because nobody without ADHD would even believe this.

I listen to the news all the time too. My husband will listen while doing 5 other things and say ""wow, that's shocking!"" and I am like ""what is?"" and he's like...what they just said on the news! Oh....wasn't listening....

30,What adderall WON‚ÄôT do for you,"I‚Äôve recently in the last month been professionally diagnosed with ADHD, after going 20 years without any medication or treatment of any kind. When hearing about adderall from everyone else, it‚Äôs easy to put it on a pedestal, and become easily reliant and attached to the medication as if it‚Äôs going to turn you into a superhero. Sad news is, it doesn‚Äôt. While it certainly helps(!), it‚Äôs not a miracle drug. It doesn‚Äôt write your schedule, it doesn‚Äôt go to the grocery store for you, and it definitely doesn‚Äôt do your laundry (sadly). It‚Äôs very easy to take it, and waste the whole day doing ‚Äúmore important tasks‚Äù like grinding Valorant and Overwatch. You‚Äôre still you, and you still have ADHD. The other half of the equation to treatment is discipline and practice. I‚Äôve been expecting that after taking adderall, that I would magically just become Mr. Business Man and start planning everything weeks ahead, be able to get all my chores done, and etc., you get the point. I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say, is that adderall isn‚Äôt the end all be all. And to rely on a medication to do that for you is a recipe for substance abuse. Adderall helps, it really does.

1,A Life-Changing Hack for Students with ADHD,"I figured out recently that the updated Microsoft Word (the one you don't need a subscription for) has a ""Dictate"" feature that actually works incredibly well. Whether you're in class or online, if you turn it on during class, Word will live translate everything that's said into text. You can see it typing as its being spoken. 

If you have issues with getting up frequently, opening tabs/browsing during lecture, fidgeting, or just zoning out only to come back and have no idea what was said, you can just refer to the notes Word is taking for you. 

Its been an absolute game changer for me and makes class less stressful, so i thought some of you would appreciate it too.

""Doesn't matter. A few hours from now, you're going to start to doubt yourself. If we contain the spaces it could be NOW, we won't have to worry later.""

She checked the bin and it wasn't there. So we started searching.

After we'd searched all the places a normie would look, we went deep dive. Under the fridge, in pot plants, under the bed, between books, in the fridge, in drawers we haven't opened in weeks, in rooms we hadn't been in.

Every time she protested that I was being illogical I said ""It doesn't matter if it doesn't make sense. We can't trust your memory. Remember when my iphone was on the roof of the car for two days? It could be anywhere.""

Tonight, she went to take out the bin after checking most of it again.

""What are you doing?""

""Putting out the rubbish. I know it isn't in there.""

""Check again.""

She took out 80% of the rubbish again.

""It can't be at the very bottom, that's from days ago.

""Doesn't matter.""

And there it was!

A lifetime of doubting myself paid off!

TL;DR - My knack for losing things helped my wife find her retainer.

3,How is everything so BORING yet OVERWHELMING at the same time,"My room is a mess yet every time I tidy it it immediately gets messy

I hate the way my clothes feel and how my hair feels brushing against my face but I have to get dressed to feel more capable of getting things done

My cats make me happy but when they're in my room they mess my bed up with their claws and their hairs get everywhere and they're so itchy

Social media gives me instant gratification but the amount of hate from ignorant people on it gets me SO angry, I can't concentrate on anything else and I can't help but argue with people who will never change their ways

I'm constantly checking the upvotes on my posts, when I get a downvote or no new votes I instantly question myself

Keeping in touch with my friends is necessary to give them support and to not isolate myself but it means me feeling like I'm too much for them, I want discussions and for some to be as passionate as I am. It leaves me feeling frustrated at them, when it's not them that's the problem it's me, never knowing when to shut up and stop oversharing

I know I have to stop eating chocolate for breakfast and lunch and impulse buying drinks instead of drinking water, but every time I try to stay healthy the food is boring and I end up with a constant headache from not eating enough

There's so many things I could be doing to enrich myself, like drawing, reading, writing, even watching a tv programme that has been on my watch list for years. Even starting my work would be more mentally fulfilling, yet I still do nothing

I thought I had it all together having a shower today and getting dressed, but I've just remembered I've forgotten to brush my teeth again and I've got a headache because I haven't had any 'real' food yet, it's 3pm.

My mum is only talking to me, yet it feels like nails scraping down a blackboard to listen to.",lszjt7,5436,1.0,240,2021-02-26 15:06:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/lszjt7/how_is_everything_so_boring_yet_overwhelming_at/,False,False,2021,2
4,Do you ever get newly angry because your brain finally finished processing disrespect that happened months ago?,"I don‚Äôt know if this is just me,  but I realised part of the reason I‚Äôm always drowning in emotion is because my brain is always dealing with today‚Äôs feelings, last week‚Äôs events and things that happened yonks ago.

In the moment when someone is being rude to me, I gaslight myself into thinking that I‚Äôm just too sensitive. 


Or I tell myself that I‚Äôm SO easygoing and detached that I don‚Äôt give a damn about anyone else‚Äôs opinions. Sometimes I don‚Äôt even notice it at all.


But then two months later at 3am...  my brain will be like ‚Äú**THE AUDACITY!**... *THE NERVE*!‚Äù. 



And it‚Äôs like an all-consuming, misanthropic level of hatred just takes over me? An anger that probably dwarfs the anger I would have had  if I had clocked the disrespect there and then. 



Then after the anger, comes the sense of shame. 


Shame because I feel bad for not protecting myself and just rolling with punches I didn‚Äôt *have* to take. 



It rarely happens to me now because I‚Äôm much more assertive & mindful, but I‚Äôd be lying if there aren‚Äôt a few people from 2017 whose faces I wanna cave in.

5,ADHD and Depression: a deadly combination,"You wake up and feel horrible, you don't want to get up, and adhd won't let you override that. So you sit there as the dozens of alarms you've set continue to go off and you're just sitting there staring at the ceiling not even mustering the energy to move your hand and turn off the alarm.

Finally you get up and go to make breakfast, but you don't really feel like eating breakfast. So you look in the fridge for a few minutes, can't decide what to make, and close the fridge.

You then get ready for the day, if youre a distance learner like me you'll fire up your laptop and do one of two things. You'll sit there blankly staring at the screen until your alarm goes off to join the class, or you browse idly through YouTube or discord. Once in class you both don't have the capacity to care and don't have the capacity to listen, so you continue to browse through social media blindly.

At the end of the day you sit there on the computer or your phone, searching for some sort of stimulation. Maybe you fire up a game to play, only to discover that you don't really care about it anymore and can't get the stimulation it used to give. So you go to bed, your mind racing and unable to stop thinking, and finally fall asleep at 2am waiting for that alarm in the morning.

So yesterday, I met with my boss, and confessed that I had no idea.  I suggested that I could dig through virtual meeting records to add up time, etc.  But that, off-handed, I just couldn‚Äôt give an accurate answer.

I told him that I recently learned about a symptom of ADHD called ‚Äútime-blindness,‚Äù and that it probably contributes to why I struggle to estimate project timelines.

‚ÄúWow.  I‚Äôve never had to think about my time like that.  I‚Äôve taken it for granted my whole life.‚Äù

9,Reminder!!! ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder so medications are not a crutch,"ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder meaning a condition that is due to differences in in the development and function of the nervous system.

I think it's worth noting for people who think that medications are a crutch that this is **physical problem with our brains** that presents as a mental heath issue.

Taking meds for this is the same as someone taking meds for a heart condition; it's maintenance for the mind.

I had it in my head for a long time that taking meds is a crutch  and it stopped me from getting the help I needed.

This goes for all medication prescribed by your doctor. Self care is not always about the cure but how we manage our illnesses.

12,Do you use booby traps in your daily life?,"One of my greatest struggles is object permanence.  Literally out of sight, out of mind.  This leads to large amounts of rotted vegetables, cold coffee, and having JUST run out of this thing i really need right now.

To combat this I set myself booby traps.   For example if I happen to notice that my shampoo is running low, I'll set the bottle in the middle of the bathroom floor so that once I'm dressed and ready for my day I will quite literally trip over it, thus reminding me I need to order more.  I often move foods in front of beverages in the fridge so that I have to interact with them, reminding me that I bought Jicama for a reason! Or I will set my meds at an odd angle to remind myself I haven't taken them yet. My house is chock full of items in odd places to help jog my memory along.

What reminders do you have to help with object permanence?

Since I'm constantly chasing the next rush, I'm not as easily distracted. Even better, I'm forced to take breaks waiting for the script to run (can take 2, 5, 10, 20 minutes).

25,I asked for an accomodation for myself at work today and my neurotypical co-workers thanked me for it.,"So I was one of four people chosen for a new position at work. It involves three weeks of training on how to use programs we need for our new job, and we're doing it over Microsoft Teams. I have three screens set up; one has the program I'm learning, one has the Teams meeting up so that I can see the screen that's being shared, and one is for notes. There's a test at the end of the 3 weeks.

&#x200B;

Since Monday I've been doing this: Copying that day's objectives into One Note, following along with the instructor on the program, and jotting down some notes whenever the instructor paused because there was a loading screen. 

But wait, I just realized the instructor's talking again and he's on a different screen now and I don't know what we're doing because I was taking notes.

Ok, I found the screen he's on and I'm following along but I don't know what objective we're working on. I don't have time to take notes because I need to follow along so I can try to figure out what we're doing.

Ok, he just said the thing he was showing wasn't important for the test. Going to try to write some notes on the thing I just kind of worked through and hope they're right. Wait, I'm reading the objectives and two of them are about the thing he was talking about, but I wasn't listening. I thought he said it wasn't important! Maybe just the first thing he said wasn't important... Oh! The program just crashed and I have to reload it.

Ok, I'm missing half the notes and I'm not even remotely on the right screen of the program. I'm going to stop trying to follow along and just listen. Then I'll just write down what I remember in my notes at break time. When's break time again? Oh, in two and a half hours. Great.

&#x200B;

Then today we were reviewing what we learned yesterday and while I was frantically trying to fill in my notes, the instructor moved on to today's lesson. At the end of 3 hours I had written absolutely no notes on that session's material. 

When we got back from break the instructor went to start the next lesson and I said, ""Before we get started, I'm actually having a hard time following along with all of the material. I feel like I get parts of it, but sometime's I'll catch the middle and end and not understand how we got there. Or I'll do something fine but not understand which objective it is, so if I was asked to perform that objective I wouldn't know what I was being asked to demonstrate. Do you think it would be possible to, instead of teaching all of the objectives and then reviewing them at the end, we could do one or two objectives all the way through and then have maybe 10 minutes for you to summarize it and for us to take notes and ask questions before we move on to the next one?""

And he was just like, ""Oh, definitely! No problem. Let's just start over from the first objective from today.""

28,About Showers,"You know what I hate about showers? You have to *keep doing them.*

Like, I took a shower yesterday, and I'm okay today because I haven't gone anywhere or done much at home except some crafting. But tomorrow I have to shower again.

This means getting towels and a few shower things together where I can reach them, setting up a place to sit for after shower things like lotion, etc, making sure I have clean clothes to change into, waiting for the water to get hot, taking the shower and everything that entails, drying myself, rinsing the tub, brushing my hair, doing the after shower stuff.....

I'm exhausted just thinking about it. And when I finally drag myself into the shower and get it done, my brain tries to check it off the to-do list until it realizes I'll have to do it all over again in a day or two. 

It never ends!


.

..

Edit: I realize a shower is not necessary every single day. I generally do not take one every single day. More like every 2-3 days, and it really depends on what I've done during the day.

Also edit: Thanks for all the advice. I'm sure it may help someone scrolling through here. I have my coping mechanisms and self-reward systems, so as the flair says, this is more of a rant than an advice-seeking post. ;) :)

Also also edit: I hate baths. Soaking in my own filth does not appeal to me, and I always have to turn the shower on anyway to rinse off from the bath. Or I have to take a shower first and then a bath, but that's just double the trouble.",loi22q,3030,0.99,586,2021-02-20 22:12:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/loi22q/about_showers/,False,False,2021,2
29,I impulsively quit my job today.,"Like so many times before, I just woke up and decided to not go to work. And then I quit via text and blocked my boss. I‚Äôm 32 years old and have been medicated on and off for most of my life. I‚Äôve been to therapy on and off as well. I am ADD-Inattentive type and struggle with depression and anxiety. Leading up to this impulse to quit my job, I felt insecure at work. I felt like no one liked me, that they thought I was stupid, and I just constantly wanted to walk out the door. Did I have a reason to feel this way? I really don‚Äôt know. But I feel so hopeless today. That I‚Äôll never be able to commit to anything, and I will always have bad work ethic. I beat myself up constantly over the things I do out of impulse. I never learn my lesson. I have 0 sense of reward or consequence and no amount of medication will ever improve that. I‚Äôve tried everything and really just want to crawl into a hole and disappear. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing even writing this, but I know someone out there with ADD must understand this on some level, and may have conquered this issue somehow. If you‚Äôre out there, please help me.

Edited to just say: The best thing that‚Äôs happened to me in days was this thread. Thank you so much everyone. For your words of encouragement and the awards.

30,I broke down crying yesterday because I realized an hour had passed since I meant to leave to go to the store. I'm really jealous of people who can just go do things.,"I made tacos, and realized we had no cheese. My husband would normally go, but he wanted to work so I was going instead. I asked my school-age sister (I'm her guardian) to come with me to the store, cause she's barely left her bed this week since it's Feb break for her. She whined about leaving her game with her friends until I realized the irritation wasn't worth it for me in that moment.

I asked my husband to have a conversation with her after I left about how she needs to not prioritize playing games over household duties. I'm a gamer too, I get you can't pause everything, but I offered to wait 15 minutes. She's just running around with her friends on Roblox, she'll do that until bedtime after we get back anyway. He, well-intentioned, immediately went to tell her to come see him after she got a break in her game.

I went in and out of brain fog for a while trying to figure out what was missing in the fridge, since we hasn't cooked in a couple of days and there were no leftovers so it looked like there was a huge amount of empty space. Then I talked to my husband about what he was going to say to my sister, since I wanted him to be clear that her playing games with her friends for most of the day is not a problem, she just needs to be able to drop it when needed. She likely also has ADHD. I don't want to shame her for literally what I do sometimes (play video games all day), I just want to teach her a life skill.

Of course, after this conversation finishes time magically passes (I have no idea what happened) and suddenly it's been 25 minutes and my sister comes out of her room. She thinks she's coming with me. I say oh, that wasn't the plan, but yeah grab your coat. She, confused and frustrated, is like wait, is that not why I was being called out? I was going to spare her the lecture since she came out on her own, so I had already told her that wasn't what it was about. She, realizing that she was not being forced to leave, slowly inched back to her room. She says something along the lines of ""oh, I don't want to make you upset though, so call me out to get groceries!"" And I'm like... no. I'm asking you to come with me. I have 3 times. You already left your game, and still refuse. I'd rather forget you're there than accept half help.

She goes and plays her game, I, frustrated, look around the kitchen more and realize its been 45 minutes. I had decided that rather than just go get cheese for dinner, I needed to take my sister and get all the groceries. I go ""well, okay, fuck this, no one wants dinner anyway"" and angrily flop on my bed. I bash my head a few times (bad I know), kick around, and eventually just start crying. My husband comes to see whats up, and I'm like...

@husband: I know I unfairly load you with a lot of daily tasks. Laundry. Groceries. Dishes. Lots of stuff. But it's because I ask you to do something and you just **do** it. And you're done in half an hour or less. I could have been back from the store 20 minutes ago. It's so unfair that every time I try to do something simple, I end up trying to do 5 other things. And it's not even distractions in this case. Even now I think it makes more sense to go get all the groceries. I think my sister needs to get out of the house. I think correcting her being so tunnel-visioned without being yanked out of it and pouting the whole time is important. I still, while sitting here breaking down, can't just prioritize getting the fucking cheese. I'm realizing I needed someone to go with me just so I had a bit more accountability and I didn't get distracted in the kitchen or zone out driving or grab 10 unrelated things in the store. And I was just angry about it. While I was crying I was angry it happened, angry I was wasting time crying over it, angry that I was hungry, angry that I was distracting my husband from work. Just angry.

It sucks because I feel like I can just go do it. My leg isn't broken, I'm not dizzy, I wasn't anxious prior to breaking down, it doesn't *feel* like there's anything preventing me from leaving. It's just repeated choices I'm making. And yet it happens over and over and over again even as I chastise myself for it.

I took a solid hour to properly calm down (it was like a release valve got hit, I would calm down for a minute then get angry and cry again). After that all 3 of us went to the store. Dinner was cold. I still grabbed random things (I HAVE FRESH MOZZARELLA FOR HOMEMADE PIZZAAAA!) But I felt better. I'm lucky I have support. But god ADHD sucks.

I'm trying to be nicer to myself. I'm not angry I've not gotten a lot of things done this week that I meant to. I just felt so powerless.",lmty4d,2887,0.99,112,2021-02-18 18:46:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/lmty4d/i_broke_down_crying_yesterday_because_i_realized/,False,False,2021,2

Edit: wow I did not expect this much attention from a vent! So lemme just give a few details for ppl trying to give advice: 

I am medicated, I take adderall twice a day.

I usually get off work at 5 or 6, so I still have time to do stuff. I just have trouble motivating myself to do it when I've worked all day.

Usually I can manage to squeeze in some guitar practice daily, but piano and songwriting is difficult bc of the lack of mobility and the fact that my piano/laptop are kept in an unheated basement. 

I have a week or two of feeling motivated and being ready to get stuff done, and I actually can get stuff done, but that fades eventually and idk how to get it back.",lmcntc,2881,1.0,177,2021-02-18 03:32:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/lmcntc/i_hate_wanting_to_do_stuff_but_then_having_no/,False,False,2021,2
32,Adhd is a SPECTRUM,"I thought I was only JUST on the ADHD spectrum, and that I was just lazy and had no discipline. I thought that I had to be a particular way to be ADHD- everyone I knew who had ADHD made me feel like I couldn't possibly have the same thing as them.

To everyone seeking diagnosis: it's a SPECTRUM. And just because someone else is ADHD, doesn't mean you will be the very same, have the same problems, and get along like two peas in a pod.

Remember that your symptoms are REAL, and that ADHD does not account for personality differences.

**TLDR; ADHD is variable.**

1. Yes ""spectrum"" is a misnomer, but I've seen it applied to ADHD hence it's use in this post. It's more like a series of clusters, if you prefer literal imagery.

That's why I focus on Serotonin as an incentive.,"I've tried nearly every mainstream focus tip there is-- Pomodoro clocks, candy for every completed task, Habitica website, etc., and none have really worked for me. These all rely on a Dopamine reward for doing thing, which ADHD dampens.

That's why in the past month I've started using Serotonin incentives. Make being productive feel good. Create a good atmosphere that you associate with productivity. For me, it's Black Coffee, Lofi Music, a soft blanket I throw on my lap, a desk I use for nothing else, a candle, and the occasional piece of White Chocolate, but it can be anything.

It's a lot easier to make working feel good than it is to convince yourself to trudge through painful work.",m17i9v,6774,0.99,381,2021-03-09 14:28:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/m17i9v/motivation_tip_dopamine_rewards_dont_really_work/,False,False,2021,3

5,"My doctor is a god of ADHD treatment. He has ADHD himself, has numerous ADHD patients, and takes the exact same medication I do (generic adderall). Here are some of his tips that I've found very helpful","As the title says my doctor is a god and I'm so lucky to have him. Here are some tips he's gave me that have been extremely helpful in my treatment.

* **Medication holidays**: Don't bother. He's been on Adderall for over 2 decades now and it still works at the right dose. He also says that taking med holidays can even set you up for anxiety and depression because of the withdrawal and recovery
* **Tolerance building**: There is a limit to how much tolerance you can build. It's OK to increase your dose if you need to. Eventually you will no longer need to increase it
* **Waking up in the morning**: If you struggle to wake up in the morning like many of us taking stimulant meds take your morning dose one hour before you actually have to wake up. Then, just go back to sleep for another hour (have 2 alarms).
    * I can personally confirm this makes mornings much easier. I can also confirm that I am perfectly capable of sleeping another 3 hours after taking my meds if I don't set an alarm lol
* **Starting dosage**: Your weight, height, and gender have exactly nothing to do with starting dosage. It's all about your genetics. He has very heavy patients who take almost none and tiny patients who take a lot
* **Starting a new stimulant med**: The side effects will be the worst the first two weeks. If it's helping your ADHD and the side effects aren't completely unbearable tough it out for at least two weeks before reducing dose or trying a different med
* **You can be very smart and still have the condition**: My doctor is very smart and successful despite also having high functioning autism in addition to ADHD. Many psychologists will assume you have anxiety, BPD, etc. Ask your psych to let you try meds for a limited time (at least 3 months) then reevaluate. Smart people with ADHD are very difficult to diagnose but treatment can be life changing despite already performing acceptably in work and school
* **Therapy is the single best thing you can spend your money on if you need it**: I have personally never needed therapy but he is very open about his own mental health and mentioned it in passing

**Disclaimer**: I am not a doctor. This is second hand advice. My doctor is a primary care physician not a psych. These tips may not be true for all people with ADHD but they should be true for most. If any of these things don't apply to you your condition is still valid. Please see a mental health professional for further guidance

**TLDR**: Medication holidays are not worth it, you won't build tolerance for ever, take a dose 1 hour before you need to get out of bed, smart/successful people can have ADHD too, therapy is awesome

**Edit: Something else I just remembered**: Attention is nothing more than the combination of motivation + memory. I wasn't sure if the meds were helping at first because they only seemed to help with motivation.

6,"After learning Jim Carrey has ADHD, his old popular movies in hindsight feel like the central themes are based on living with ADHD","I honestly don't know if it's even intentional, but if you contrast the content of the movies he starred in they more or less seem to be based around prominent ADHD characteristics;

 - **The Mask** - The timid, awkward, and shy office worker turns into a wild life of a party by compulsively relying on a social mask to hide his real self so that he comes off as a more appealing and entertaining person?
 - **Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind** - Constantly falling into a trap of returning to past relationships as soon as they end, having forgotten why the relationship failed and preventing you from moving forward?
 - **Me, Myself, & Irene** - The dual nature of ADHD that makes you both extremely caring and extremely volatile at a drop of a hat, and the feeling of powerlessness trying to exert any form of control?
 - **Dumb & Dumber** - The clutzy, airheaded, and quirky nature of ADHD making you feel like a complete idiot, whether you are one or not?
 - **Yes Man** - The constant overthinking, anxiety and cynicism thwarting your life from moving forward, so you compulsively begin doing things you don't even want to do because you're afraid of regretting on missing out on not doing it, leading you to feeling overwhelmed and strained, but unable to say no due to ominous dread that saying no will make bad shit happen and cause you to fall back to square one?
 - **Bruce Almighty** - The feeling that the universe is out to get you and screw you over, falling back on power fantasies of how things would be better if you were more fortunate not recognizing that the problem may not necessarily be with your current situation but your frame of mind?
 - **The Truman Show** - The feeling that your life is just a big act to fit in with society, and the struggle to break free from societal expectations once you recognize the boundaries you're trapped within?
 - **Liar Liar** - The pathological lying that comes as a result of trying to always say the right thing becoming so deeply ingrained that you become incapable of functioning honestly?

I might be missing some, but that's off the top of my head. Honestly, some are bigger stretches than others, also I wrote the little *breakdowns* to prompt discussion, I just wanted to point it out but felt that just dropping a list without some explanation would feel dry, but I don't feel like writing so take what I wrote with a grain of salt. I'm not saying NT wouldn't experience the same issues, but in ADHD folk they appear to be a lot more pronunciated.

I was gonna also write how some of these movies offer solutions on how to overcome these barriers as a form of resolution, but I literally cba to think rn and I struggle to English properly sigh...",m9uhkf,5087,0.98,274,2021-03-21 11:11:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/m9uhkf/after_learning_jim_carrey_has_adhd_his_old/,False,False,2021,3

They thought I was making an excuse at first, then acted as if it was the most insane thing they‚Äôve ever heard, and suggested that a lobotomy might help... they‚Äôve been supportive in the past but everyone‚Äôs patience wears thin eventually I guess.

ADHD meds clear the noise and help you focus but what to focus on is still your call.

there are so many things i could put here, but here are some of the highlights

the fact that i got scolded or screamed at what felt like nearly every day for yEARS

the fact that i struggled so badly for so long and absolutely no one took my concerns seriously

the fact that i was always the last person to finish any quiz/exam/standardized test, i always used all of the time i was given (i still think it‚Äôs strange that other people didn‚Äôt) and even then on several occasions i wasn‚Äôt able to finish even though i knew the material

the fact that i routinely had to have meetings with my teachers about those exams and i tried to explain to them that i knew all the answers, but i just ran out of time, and if i had some more time to work i could have finished, and getting an ‚Äòaw that‚Äôs too bad‚Äô in response

BUT even when i did finish, i ended up making ‚Äòcareless mistakes‚Äô even after reading each question multiple times to make sure i knew what it was asking and checking every answer multiple times (this was especially true for math, and any time we were allowed to use a calculator, i had to do the simplest calculations (like 2+2) multiple times to make sure they were correct

the fact that other people could finish simple in class assignments in like 10 mins but i almost always had to take the work home to finish it, adding to my mountain of homework

the fact that i felt like i had to work so much harder as everyone else to get decent grades

the fact that all of the above and many other things have absolutely destroyed my self esteem and my sense of self

15,Getting annoyed at people calling adhd a super power.,"Reason why I get annoyed at this comment is because I've always had adhd, especially primarily inattentive type but due to me being female as well as not being the hyperactive type it went undiagnosed all my life until now at the age of 20, I'm finally being medicated and I see the difference. 

Adhd for me isn't a super power. Especially when I went undiagnosed, it has ruined my life, everything was ruined because of all the symptoms I have that went unnoticed. It made me not being able to pay attention in class and to get assignments done on time, It left me not being able to go to university at the same time as everyone else despite really wanting to, it left me not being able to keep a job for more than 1 or 5 months at a time, it left me not being able to clean my room despite having mold growing on food and dishes. It also left me impulsively buy things and only to forget about them the next day, or binge eating food until I want to vomit and binge drinking alcohol to the point where I could potentially die, all because I confuse my boredom for extreme sadness, anger issues so debilitating that it has ruined my relationship with my mother due to emotional dysregulation. It made me not being able to keep up with basic hygiene because I would lose time and I wouldn't realise a week has gone by. It made me buy new underwear and wear the same dirty  clothes because I found it too difficult to even pick up my dirty laundry and to throw them into the washing machine even though it's such a simple task. 

Yeah I'm funny, outgoing and creative and I can learn easily especially when the task is hands on and I'm able to hyper focus under extreme pressure to the point where I can keep up with being timed on tasks at work. However these qualities are great and all, at the end of the day it doesn't feel like a super power and that it has caused depression and anxiety for me along with shame and self hate.",m7oz2p,3946,0.99,556,2021-03-18 11:43:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/m7oz2p/getting_annoyed_at_people_calling_adhd_a_super/,False,False,2021,3
16,Adhd in girls gets so overlooked,"I was recently diagnosed with adhd and looking back on my childhood, now knowing the symptoms, it's so obvious. 

  EVERY teacher always used to descride me as the student that ""could do very well in school if she could focus and make more of an effort"".

The only reason I didn't get in trouble for my hyperactivity is that the teachers never scolded the female students. Each time I talked to my guyfriends during class, they would get the blame. Every time I would bother my guyfriends, they would get the blame. Even when they did absolutely nothing. 

The signs were all there, the issues were all there, but they all got overshadowed by the guys in my class that had the more hyperactive type of adhd.



Edit: okay so alot of people are bringing up the fact that the inattentive type of adhd is harder to spot, but I have the combined type and I was hyper and disruptive in school, but my issues still got ignored.

However, *I couldn't remember if I had actually been accepted into the grad program, or just daydreamed about reading my acceptance letter*. I had to go back, find the email, and relive that moment of anticipation in order to confirm that I *was* in fact not rejected.

24,Sometimes it feels like covid lockdown was designed specifically to make my ADHD 10x worse.,"Got my way through high school with undetected ADHD. The pressure of outside accountability, rigid structure, constant social stimulation, and tons of extracurriculars I was interested in helped me compensate a ton.

I had no clue just how much that was holding me together. Turns out my world was hanging by a thread. I completely fell apart during quarantine. No sleep schedule, no exercise, no socialization, constantly lonely and hyperfixating on my few online relationships, unable to work on my passions, stumbling into panic episodes and despair about what I'm going to do with my life, feeling like I didn't recognize myself. The covid world is terrible for ADHD brains. I can hardly think of a scenario worse for us. It sounds like something out of a sci-fi novel: complete lockdown of all interesting and stimulating activities, you can only do things on your computer in your room now. I had to quit uni last semester, got diagnosed two weeks ago. It's a relief in some ways, but also terrifying to know that my ability to function normally was dependent on factors entirely outside of my control.

Hoping others feel this way. Covid is a nightmare scenario for ADHD brains. I'm struggling to remember that the world used to feel interesting at all.

25,The painful cycle of initially charming people but eventually just disappointing them...,"1. People are often attracted to your openness and unintentional zaniness at first

2. They quickly get annoyed and confused with your impulsiveness and lack of conscientiousness. 

3. They (usually) accept your idiosyncrasies and realise you‚Äôre actually smart, interesting and refreshing. 

4. Eventually the frustration mounts up and (whilst they may still like you as a person) the relationship slowly but inevitably begins to die. 

Sometimes there‚Äôs a happy ending but oftentimes there isn‚Äôt.

Sound familiar?

Here‚Äôs a case study with my manager; 

During the interview he acted as though I was a breath of fresh air - I like to think I genuinely am sometimes - my random tangential responses made me appear more relaxed and interesting and he hired me on the spot in fact.

Then over the next few weeks the cracks began to emerge and I‚Äôd make frustrating mistakes in processes he had already run my through several times, forget crucial details, leave customers on hold for hours, forget things he told me etc and he began to get annoyed and frustrated.

Then over the next few months when we formed a slightly more personal bond I was able to disclose
My ADHD and you know explained the atavistic survival advantages if we were a tribe I would be keeping his ass alive and random other factoids and shit - he became aware that I‚Äôm actually the smarter person in the building in a more abstract sense and would run ideas and theories and things past me and even asked me for some personal advice. I excelled at building rapport with people but my lack of attentiveness remained as my crown of thorns. 

... but 6 months or so in the frustrations around my immutable lack of attention to detail and tardiness and the fallout of that has just started becoming intolerable for him, and he basically just told me that he thinks I have lots of positive qualities but the job isn‚Äôt really for me ( he‚Äôs not wrong) and he doesn‚Äôt have time to be mopping up my mess.

So I told him I‚Äôm in the process of finding other work (I am and have been for a while) and he expressed that we should still catch up over a drink every now and then. Even though I know part of him means it I know that we never will. 

//

This is actually the usual concatenation of unfortunate events with friendships and even romantic relationships too.
‚ÄúI like (or maybe even love) you but I‚Äôve got to let you go for the sake of my own psyche‚Äù is sort of the vibe I often get.  Or my lack of clear communication is interpreted as lack of effort and the relationship collapses.

I know I possess all the qualities people have pointed out in me, I know my intentions are pure and I‚Äôm trying to try but I can‚Äôt help but feel like shit knowing that In most cases I‚Äôll end up disappointing people and it‚Äôs not a matter of it but when. 

It can make it hard to believe that you‚Äôre a truly worthwhile person.

But we must believe it, even if the whole world seems to turn its back on us. 

We must recognise our own intrinsic value. 

We‚Äôre trying to succeed in a society that isn‚Äôt built for our success.

We‚Äôre trying.

Edit: 
Also worth noting that my craving for novel stimulation definitely results in a significant drop in attention and investment at work and in personal relationships - so it‚Äôs likely that my effort and performance in these areas does decrease and it‚Äôs not just a matter of withering peoples patience and tolerance. 
(Losing a job is bad but seeing a personal relationship disintegrate because of this is crushing) 

I‚Äôm sure most of us can relate to this as well.

Edit 2: I know this post walks the line between self pity, catharsis and self compassion, but it really wasn‚Äôt intended to come out as bleak as it did.

So here‚Äôs an addendum:

We must be kind to ourselves, but that doesn‚Äôt entail wallowing in despair. We can and should strive to improve our areas of deficiency whether that‚Äôs through medication, behavioural therapy and modification, mindset shifts, environmental changes etc.

I always tell myself that even if the chances of reaching my elusive ‚Äúpotential‚Äù is 1/10000000000, is that not still worth trying for?

Most of all remember that we aren‚Äôt bad people regardless of how our actions might be misinterpreted at times. We have a mental disorder. We aren‚Äôt deliberately trying to hurt or disappoint anybody. We aren‚Äôt useless or inept or braindead or lazy. As long as we are trying we are worthy of living a good life like anybody else.",lx9mml,3573,0.99,321,2021-03-04 01:39:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/lx9mml/the_painful_cycle_of_initially_charming_people/,False,False,2021,3
26,Helpful and specific ADHD college tips that have NOTHING to do with studying:,"As college students with ADHD, **we hear the same things over and over again:** *""get a planner"", ""set multiple timers"", ""study in the library"", ""Put your phone away"", blah blah blah.""* But how many of them do our brains hear and go ""yooo that's pretty good, Imma do that""? That's right: close to none.

But it's not hopeless for us. One thing I know about us college students with ADHD is that we already know what we should do. However, **the more specific and obscure a tip is displayed, the more our brains will be enticed by it.** And ADHDers require catalyst actions (small actions that eventually snowball) so that we can refrain from having to use our willpower or rely on motivation. Using cues is less likely to drive us into existential despair.

So please grab some water, play a chill song (or repeatedly tap your feet; or both), and enjoy. **These tips will NOT mention how to do your homework or study. I don't want to give you something that might stress you out.** SO instead, I am coming at you with tips that will positively impact other areas, which will hopefully then make it a whole lot easier for your brain to do however much you're able to accomplish in a day with less fuss.

This list is categorized into 6 groups: **waking up on time, getting to places on time, getting stuff done, alleviating stress, getting to bed on time, and the basics.**

# Waking up on time:

**Jar of gummy bears with obscure meme references on the labels:** I keep clear jars of gummy bears (I love them because they are sweet but not too sweet for me) and Crunch bars with labels that reference my favorite memes (the gummy bear one says ""Dumb Bitch Fuel"" and the Crunch one says ""Doge""). They make me sort of laugh when I see them and I tell myself I get to take one of each as soon as I wake up for my short 15-second walk to the bathroom to wash my face and brush my teeth. Having rewards just for waking up sets me up for a good day.

**Invest in a Google Home (and a travel router, dimmable lightbulb, and smart plug):** See, y'all will never convince me that technology has ruined productivity because I truly believe that anything can be useful if you wield it correctly. Our brains don't like doing things that require effort. So why not just cut out the middle man and have an AI do it for us? I use my Google Home Mini (only $49 at Walmart) to set my morning alarm, set reminders, turn on my lights, put on music, send texts, make calls, and help me fall asleep faster by playing rain sounds. For the morning, using the ""Good Morning"" routine (that is customizable), I can know what the weather is like so I can prepare my outfit, get reminders for the day so I don't have to struggle to know what I should do, turn on my dimmable soft white lamp (only $5 at Walmart), turn on my kettle for tea (connected through a smart plug that was $8 at Walmart), and play feel-good music without even lifting a finger! So much energy saved and instead used to get myself to the bathroom and wash my face. 

*(The travel router is for college students with Wi-Fi that requires a Portal Login. Google Home and Smart Appliances do not support Portal Logins and having a travel router helps you create a safer bridge between your devices and your school internet.)*

# Getting to places on time

**Pick a hype and fast-paced songs to walk to your classes with:** I play either Poker Face by Lady Gaga or Boss Bitch by Doja Cat because a) I'm a proud bisexual that had a lesbian phase in elementary school, and b) I know every lyric and beat of those songs and they get me to walk fast with simple quadruple meter beats. Not only do I get to class fast, but I strut. And getting to listen to the music is an incentive to walk out the door.

**Fun sunglasses:** I have essentially no shame and love to display my... eccentricity and authenticity. When I feel like it, I wear fun glasses outside and pretend to be Lady Gaga while I strut to my 8am Spanish class.

**Once you're out, there is no turning back:** we tend to get so bogged down and stressed with how long it's gonna take us to walk to class and waste energy. But you need to look at things much closer. Once you're dressed, you won't be tempted to crawl back to bed. Once you're out your door, you won't be tempted to go back in. Once you start walking, your brain will just keep going because it'll be too tired to make any other decisions. Make it easier on your brain.

# Getting stuff done

**Desk analog clock:** literally just for the aesthetic. It makes my desk look so much more professional and it also has a purpose. I am just more likely gonna be drawn to my desk if it has stuff there that makes sense but also doesn't.

**Forest:** This app was brought to us by the ADHD Gods. For $2.99, you can download Forest and place money bets. Set a timer to get your work done then place a bet in monetary value (I place $5 for easy tasks, $20 for medium tasks, and $100 for hard tasks) and the app basically tracks if you pick up and open your phone before the allotted time for your task has run out. And if you do open your phone to check, it sends you a notification to put it away. If you don't do it on time, you lose your bet and your money. I use this even for stuff like picking up stuff on my floor. This way, even if I don't do shit, at least I take a break from using my phone.

**Statue Head pencil holder:** again, the aesthetic. I love museums and I bought a Statue of David planter that I use as a pencil holder and it just makes my desk so much more inviting. I'm more likely to sit down and do something.

**Laptop riser, mechanical keyboard, and mouse or external trackpad:** BAD POSTURE HURTS. I spent so much of high school crouched over my laptop and not only would that cause me pain and strain, but it would also tire me out and irritate me. I bought a high laptop riser that places my screen up at eye level so that I can sit straight. Buying a mechanical keyboard to hook it up to the laptop eliminates the need to reach across and use my regular keyboard and helps place my hands at a more relaxed level (plus I love the Brown and Blue switch sounds and the RGB settings). I'm a mouse girl, but if you prefer, you can buy an external trackpad as well. The investment is SO WORTH IT!!

**Fountain pens in different colors:** I don't know what it is about fountain pens, but they motivate me to write pretty notes, even if it's just a reminder to take out the trash. They are so satisfying to write with.

# Help out with stress

**Buy a hot water bottle:** having something warm and inviting against your body helps calm down your breathing, slow your heart rate, and clear your mind, which lowers the production of cortisol (our stress hormones). It's a cheap and better option than a teddy bear.

**Buy with Cash when purchasing in person:** Do you ever have that moment of ""oh shit, how much money did I spend this month?""? Use cash for in-person purchases and for online purchases, use your banking app to set a limit. Being aware of your finances in the simplest and least stressful way possible lets your mind have more space to think about other things.

**Follow the random urges:** most of our urges don't harm anyone or anything. Do you want to skip and hop on your morning walk? Do it. Do you want to dance while brushing your teeth? Do it. When appropriate, remind yourself to stop masking. It alleviates the stress you place on your mind to retain self-control.

**Pastel sticky notes:** Brightly colored sticky notes make me not want to read them. Buying softer colored sticky notes and instead of using a bold black marker to write my reminders down will make it more likely that I'll look at it. Backgrounds need to be softer if we want our brains to not get too visually stimulated before we get the chance to read what is on the paper.

**Buy a desk lamp with outlets and pencil holders:** If you're the type of person where when you're scrolling on Reddit at your desk and you use your phone wanting to charge as a catalyst to get in bed and hibernate there, then this tip is for You! Use a desk lamp with outlets so that you can easily charge your phone there and use Reddit while sitting down. That way you're more likely to get tired of it when you get uncomfortable.

**Paint your water bottle in a stark but inviting aesthetic:** I painted mine in the Kawaii fashion, with my favorite pink-haired anime characters in chibi style, along with sakura flowers. My life aesthetic is dark academia. But Kawaii is so soft and stands out amongst my old books and vintage decor. It makes me want to pick it up and drink. Oh, and bonus: my bottle has a straw.

# Getting to bed on time

**Lavender pillow spray:** Lavender scents help most people fall asleep and there are actually sprays that you can spray on your pillow that are safe to sleep against and inhale so closely. It makes falling asleep so much easier for me. (Along with rain or fan sounds).

# The basics

**Dental care cup:** Do you find it hard to brush your teeth in the morning? If you do not already have your dental stuff in the bathroom, this one is for you: buy a pretty cup from the dollar store and put your toothbrush, toothpaste, and floss in there, and put it on your nightstand or desk. That way on your way to pee, it's right there for you to pick up and bring with you.

**Meme shower reward:** I love uploading memes to r/adhdmeme so I use showering as a thinking space for what I upload. I tell myself I can upload a meme there if and only if I shower. It definitely does the job!

**Frequent your local Dollar Store:** Buying snacks and making useless impulse purchases is hard when shit is so expensive. The solution? Thrift shops and the Dollar Store. I buy my chips, nuts, frozen fruits, brownie mixes, and other small snacky foods there, so I can buy a bunch of them without spending too much money. 

**Star-shaped stickers to congratulate yourself for doing the basics... and reward yourself:** Yes, I use the star sticker reward system for ""stuff that I should already be doing because they're important."" Who gives a shit? Surviving is HARD and getting out of bed and brushing my teeth and eating and showering are TOUGH. So yeah, I give myself sparkly stickers on a colorful board for how many times I brushed my teeth and then I give myself a reward. 

Please keep in mind that I use these tips in conjunction with therapy and medication and CBT. If I want these tips to be effective, I also need to work on my baseline mood and mindset. Take care of yourself internally. And remember: there is nothing wrong with you and you're doing the absolute best that you can. And I'm so so SO damn proud of you <3",mb62yi,3490,0.99,388,2021-03-23 04:01:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/mb62yi/helpful_and_specific_adhd_college_tips_that_have/,False,False,2021,3
27,This group has done so much for me even though I mostly just lurk and cheer for ppl,"I have been a part of this sub for a while and I'm always reading everyone's support for so long that I finally pushed myself to get medicated again. I haven't seen a doctor in ten years bcuz of bad parents and then no insurance for so long but this month I did it. I got my referral to psych and can start trying adhd meds again. I havent had meds since I was in 7th grade (I'm 27 now) and I'm so excited!

I haven't realized how much adhd effects my life and others without this sub and I need to thank every single one of you for sharing and being here. If anyone else is struggling to make that push like me, just do it. The excitement alone to make this journey is going to make the work worth it. I'll probably still be a lurker (lol) but just know that someone like me is cheering for every single one of you bcuz your struggle makes a difference in this world.

28,What happens when Dad and Daughter BOTH have ADHD.,"My 7-year-old daughter, who is awaiting diagnosis, tries her hardest but struggles to focus and remember what she needs to do. She's a lot like me.

As we were leaving for school, we went through her schoolbag checklist.

""Homework?""

""Yep.""

""Lunch?""

""Got it""

""Piano Books?""

""Oh, I forgot, they're in my room!""

Her piano books are a big issue. She has lessons at school once a week and often forgets them.

We get to school and I drop her off only to realise that I have lost my wallet. Crap. I've left it at my friend on the other side of town's house. So I head over to his house. Soon as I arrive, I get a call from school.

""Your daughter has forgot her lunch.""

HOW?!?! It was in her bag. I saw it!

Oh well, I chat with my friend for a couple of minutes and then head back to pick up her lunchbox and...the phone rings. It's the school wondering where I am. IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME! I wasted the whole morning with my friend! I grab the lunchbox (it was under a pile of books) and head to the school.

She gets her lunch ten minutes late and every is fine.

I've just walked in the door and sitting in front of me on the kitchen table is the ""pile of books"" her lunch was under.

It's her piano books.

I need a drink.

**I'm making this a success because we solved the problem (mostly) and didn't panic. We've got each others backs and that's a win in my (piano) book.**

Edit: To clarify to those suggesting we have a checklist at the door, this WAS the checklist. She sat there with her bag, looked in and SAW the items she needed. Somehow, the book and the lunchbox got out of her bag.",m2fbmx,3409,1.0,376,2021-03-11 02:06:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/m2fbmx/what_happens_when_dad_and_daughter_both_have_adhd/,False,False,2021,3
29,Ableism in textbooks,"Hi y‚Äôall, 

I wanted to share with you all a bit of a breakthrough I had today that I‚Äôm hoping encourages the rest of you as much as it is me. 

First, the bad news. There was a LOT of awful ableism in my textbook. Part of this post will contain examples, but it‚Äôs not the whole post and I hope you will scroll past those examples if they cause you anxiety and skip to the end. 

I‚Äôm in a psychology class right now called lifespan development. Last night I had to read a chapter in which adhd was addressed at length. I can honestly say it was some of the most harmful things I‚Äôve read in a textbook about this sort of thing, and it just hurt. I hurt for myself, and for the larger community. Contained within the chapter were points made from outdated sources, pseudoscience, stereotypes, generalizations, and horrifically overstated claims. They said (and I quote) ‚Äúchildren with adhd are burdens to teachers and parents‚Äù. They also literally only addressed boys / children who are boys. There‚Äôs zero mentions of adulthood adhd, nor of adhd in folks who aren‚Äôt little boys. 

They also claimed that we are over diagnosed to an extreme - like practically 90% of the time. 

They claimed that ALL people over the age of 8 or so fabricate symptoms to get an adhd diagnosis so they can fuel an addiction. They mention the addiction thing a lot. 

They also mentioned that mothers and female teachers are biased against little boys and therefore pathologize normal young male behaviors out of a place of hate/ignorance.

I can go on, but I think you get the point. It claimed to represent ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù of the ‚Äúargument‚Äù meanwhile they literally did no such thing and made sweeping generalizations that are harmful. 


I talked to my boyfriend about it, and I told him a part of me felt I should say something to my professor but I was anxious/didn‚Äôt know if I was overreacting. 

He encouraged me to do it, and I did, despite the lightweight panic attack I had to fight. 



This morning, I got replies.

She expressed overwhelming support for our community, and made it very clear that her and I are absolutely on the same page. She went further to note why she felt I was correct and how wrong it all was. She went on to suggest that she help me take this to the publishers/authors of the textbook to make an even bigger impact. 

She then said she was going to make a new module for the class to address adhd, pseudoscience, ableism against adhd, etc and share resources so that the whole class becomes better educated and aware. She asked if I‚Äôd be willing to look at her ideas and sources and be a sounding board for her, I said yes.

This is not a ‚Äúgood for me‚Äù post. This is was a victory against myself and my anxiety - yes. But more than that I did this for all of you. I did this because of how much love and respect I have for our community. I hope this brightens your day.


{EDIT} : Several people have asked me for the title of the textbook. Here‚Äôs the truth as to why I did not immediately provide it at first : classic ‚Äúoverwhelm‚Äù lol. I was in a sh*t storm of homework and getting more likes and comments than I ever anticipated / have ever received (ABSOLUTELY NOT A COMPLAINT I HAVE SO MUCH GRATITUDE AND LOVE FOR ALL OF YOU) I was just getting super sensory overloaded on top of being with a friend at the time who was playing insanely loud video games and trying to talk to me. So a very simple request was not followed through with in as timely of a manner as I should have - I apologize. This apparently created suspicion so I want to clear that up if I can. Here‚Äôs the information for the textbook. 

Berger, K. (2019). LaunchPad for Invitation to the Life Span (Six Months Access) (4th ed.). Macmillan. [ISBN 9781319211394]
 
My professor and I have had a really hard time figuring out how to move forward since she could only find this person on LinkedIn, but I‚Äôm going to create an account and try that method (I‚Äôve never used that site before) and see what happens. I looked into this author and I have yet to see any red flags, which is odd to me considering how harmful this was. 

A huge thank you to all of you who have been so incredibly kind and supportive of me. I literally did not expect anyone to even read this if I‚Äôm being honest, and I was nervous to post it - hence it not being entirely articulate. But your overwhelming (in the best way) love and support has already brought me so much healing and acceptance within myself. I wish the best for each and every one of you. Thank you for sharing your hearts and stories with me. I‚Äôm proud to be a part of this community, because of all of you in large part. I did this for all of you.

30,I DID IT! OFFICIALLY a PhD student!,"Dear 17 year old me, you're probably still frustrated with school, life, the world (adolescent things). You're sick of worksheets all day and struggling to get through school. You know there is so much more to education. You're capable but there are no resources, no one is willing to change. You are often told, ""Maybe college isn't for you."" ""Don't teach, it's terrible!"" ""Umm you, a teacher?""The factory model feeds you boredom, demands strict adherence to guidlines, and your ADHD makes it twice as hard to even function with those around you at times. Just keep flying under the radar.

31,Trying to explain ADHD to someone that doesn't have it is impossible.,"Every struggle that we have can be a shared experience to almost anyone that doesn't have the disorder. Short term memory, procrastination, forgetfullness, impulsivity, distractability, racing thoughts, brain fog, RSD, insomnia, mental fatigue, zoning out, anxiety, guilt, shame, rambling, time blindness, interrupting, low self-esteem, depression, starting but not finishing, to name a few.

The problem is trying to explain to people that our intentions do not match these struggles. I didn't intend on waiting until the last minute to start a task. I didn't intend on being late. I didn't intend on misplacing my keys. I didn't intend on forgetting about the meeting today. I didn't intend to spend an hour making a sandwich. I didn't intend on not responding to your text for 3 monthd.

It literally haunts our *every* action and thought. We believe ourselves to be broken individuals because of the confliction between how our mind operates vs how the world around us operates.

Our disorder is downplayed because of the frequency of our struggles in *other people's* lives. A one-off moment in your life is my entire day. ""I misplaced my keys and showed up 15 mins late this morning, must have been an A-D-D moment"" is just like saying ""my leg fell asleep today for 10 mins, must have been a paraplegic moment."" 

**It is incredibly insulting to mock a serious disorder because the symptoms are universal.**

Don't feel bad because others are ignorant and choose to be so. You are so much more than your disorder. You are a fish that is expected to climb a tree. Fuck that, swim your ass off. Be exactly who you are, everyone else is taken. You aren't broken, others are incredibly insensitive. Zone out the haters and doubters.

Do yourself a favor. Surround yourself with people that accept you for who you are, not for who they expect you to be. You are so awesome for making it this far in a world not made for you. You are stronger than you have ever been told. Learn to love, laugh at, and forgive yourself. You have what it takes. You can do this. I believe in you.

32,Learning about your ADD as an adult is OVERWHELMING,"Some, if not most of us have been in this spot.

Living your whole life under a thick layer of fog, where you can't properly navigate, yet still have to choose a direction of movement and adapt, there is no time to figure out why some things the way they are. You have to be in motion, man up, get your shit together and stop complaining.

As society always dictated - YOU are ALWAYS responsible for everything that happens in your life and holding that accountability is the only way to improve.

Well, guess what, this does not fucking apply when the most complex and significant part of our body is **dysfunctional.** The most baffling experience is listening to other people's stories and having that unshakeable feeling that this is your own autobiography. Through those stories the most unforgiving and surreal realization arrives. Even the most tiniest and insignificant moments where our condition took over and prevented us from being the way we wish to be, happened simply because of the way how our brain operates.

&#x200B;

\- Not because you are weak-minded and lack discipline

\- Not because you are intentionally wasting your potential

\- Not because you are lazy and don't appreciate what people do for your well-being

\- Not because you are less intelligent than your peers

\- Not because you are intentionally inattentive and don't care about other people

&#x200B;

Today was the day when everything took a complete 180 turn and the prism of my own internal perception shattered into a million small pieces.

Thanks for reading this ramble. I am so overwhelmed I have to put up those thoughts somewhere so I don't go crazy with reassessing every single moment in my life where ADD disintegrated my self-esteem, bit by bit.

Long journey ahead, but at least, I know the fucking direction in which I have to move. For which, I am already grateful.",mf1699,3221,1.0,230,2021-03-28 13:58:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/mf1699/learning_about_your_add_as_an_adult_is/,False,False,2021,3
33,"Don't know who needs to hear this, but stop trying to read books you don't like","As a kid, I used to read all the time. But school transformed reading into something I HAD to do, and as a result my love for books completely went away. On top of that I started to struggle to sustain my attention while reading. to the point I haven't finished a book in YEARS (except when I had to force myself for school).

I realized I was obsessing over reading books I thought I had to read, like classics and things people would recommend to me. The pile of books I hadn't read yet was only more overwhelming, and prevented me from even starting one.

Yesterday I said f*ck it, bought a fantasy romance book because that's my shit and I shouldn't be ashamed of it (ACOTAR for those who know).

I wait until it's become a much bigger task and I have to dig back through two weeks of notes to do my updates.

But if someone asks me to help them type up a letter, or help with an assignment, I can immediately jump into it happily.

Someone could ask me to do THEIR discussion response, or update THEIR case log, and it would be enjoyable. But when it's mine, I dread it.

Not really looking for advice - I know how to make myself get my crap together and get it done - I'm just curious to know why I dread it SO much and if this is something other people notice.

35,"Do you also become obsessed with trying to track and quantify as many things as you can in your life, only to get overwhelmed and burnt out after a few days?","This happens to me once every couple of months. Here are some of the things I've tried to do, with the mindset that ""this will help me build better habits"" or ""what's measured improves"" and so on.

\- Tracking the time I spend on every single activity in my life using excel sheets (from tasks at work, to going to the toilet or even time spent playing with my cat).‚ÜíGot completely exhausted after two days.

\- Tracking all the calories, water and caffeine I consume, as accurately as possible. ‚ÜíWasted so much time trying to figure out the exact number of calories in everything my gf and I cook.

\- Buying a fitness tracker to collect as much data as possible about myself (this was actually a good thing in the long run, once I stopped being obsessed with refreshing the app every five minutes).

\- Impulsively downloading countless of apps and programs that track different aspects of what I do on my computer or phone. Impulsively deleting most of them after a while.

\- Writing down at the end of the day everything I could remember. (Brain goes completely blank when I try to do this).

Current attempt: I started using exist.io and linked as many data sources I have that don't require me to actively track stuff (except for my mood and a few tags at the end of the day).

Do you guys have similar obsessions? I think this ends up doing more harm than good every time I try. Is there a healthy way for people with ADHD to track stuff without getting overwhelmed?

Edit: I didn't expect this to be so relatable to so many people because I really couldn't find a post about being obsessed with time tracking when I searched this subreddit, so thank you all for sharing your experience. This means a lot to me, really. Here's a list of words that have at some point been a important part of my life for a very short time, that might make you gasp in ""relatableness"": Fitbit, Todoist, Toggl, Clockify, Strava, Sleep Cycle, daily journaling, a spreadsheet containing all the books I own, a Python program used to create that spreadsheet by scanning barcodes, more time spent tracking stuff than actually doing stuff, more time talking or writing about tracking stuff than actually doing stuff, eating the same meals every day to optimize food tracking, trying to find a nutritionally complete liquid meal to substitute every meal with, trying to set a fixed number of tasks to tackle every day (no more, no less), etc.

36,I took my first Ritalin pill today and i couldn't believe that was how people lived all along.,"So, i'm a young adult at 21, i got diagnosed last monday by my psychiatrist, he prescribed me Lexapro and Ritalin, i begun taking Lexapro from day one, i didn't have any side effects besides excess sleep, and today i took my first Ritalin pill. I'm a computer engineering college student and i had a crazy programming assignment, 20 minutes before starting it i decided to try Ritalin to see if it really would help with my focus, and before i noticed, i was blasting through my code, and i wasn't getting bored, it felt really weird, because usually i code for 30-40 minutes and quit until the next day, but today i was just going, not feeling hyperactive or anything, just felt calm and at peace. I managed to finish my assignment with an almost perfect score and i was so happy i wanted to share with you guys.  


Feel free to tell the story about your first time on ADHD meds too, i would love to read them.

Edit: Holy cow, I didn't expect this post to blow up overnight, thanks everyone for sharing your stories, I read every comment I could. I'm now aware that eventually ritalin will have less euphoric effects on me, but just to be clear, my doctor told me to take it only when in need, I can take a maximum of one pill per day, but I intend to only take on days I need to focus on, like heavy studying or tests/hard assignments, I'm trying to learn to manage tasks piece by piece too, like do something for 20 minutes and take a break (with an alarm to remind me) to clear the mind and not get stressed or bored.",mh0yso,2936,0.99,360,2021-03-31 07:49:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/mh0yso/i_took_my_first_ritalin_pill_today_and_i_couldnt/,False,False,2021,3

I always thought it was just simple depression, but turns out I just have chronically low Reward Juice that other people normally have in their brains that keep them running even when everything else is dull.

Would you deny them a wheelchair because you were scared they would ‚Äúbecome too dependent‚Äù?  
Of course not! What kind of sadistic fuckery is that??  
Okay, now theoretically, a person with NORMALLY FUNCTIONING legs, if they ONLY used a wheelchair would eventually have their legs atrophy, and effectively become dependent.  
Sure, of course.  
When a person with no clinical need abuses prescription medicine, they can similarly destroy/alter their neurons so that they BECOME dependent.
Okay...   
BUT, IF YOU HAVE ADHD, YOUR SHIT IS ALREADY FUCKED UP. You‚Äôve been DEPENDENT on stimulants since you were born. You ALWAYS will be. Tolerance building aside, you cannot ‚ÄúBECOME DEPENDENT‚Äù. You can‚Äôt destroy the neurons you never had.

2,Just wanted to thank this subreddit for its lack of toxic positivity. It's a relief.,"I have ADHD and am also autistic.

Every autism subreddit I have seen is rife with toxic positivity. It's impossible to mention even the slightest struggle related to my own experience with autism. 

For some reason, people on these subreddits take another person's opinion on their OWN life very personally. If I post that I am frustrated at feeling distanced from other people and wishing I had better social skills, I will get 1 comment that is supportive and the rest are all people who feel that I have posted simply to spite them and insult their existence.

They will say ""You have a negative attitude about autism and your internalized ableism is  unhealthy. I am autistic and I love every second of it, watch some inspirational youtube videos about autistic savants and cheer the fuck up.""

One of the top posts in the aspergers subreddit is concerning this exact topic, and even there the comments are locked due to toxicity. I understand and respect that some see autism as their personality and that it is a ""superpower"" or a benign difference. But to me, it is not. It is a label that I have, like ""right-handed."" I guess you can say that is a part of who I am but it is not even close to all of me. And again, for me, autism is anything but a positive and it certainly not benign. 

Here, in this subreddit I feel free and supported to discuss my struggles which often overlap with my autism. I also have to praise this subreddit's rejection of neurodiversity. In autism subs it is common to see posts insulting non-autistic people and some even see being autistic people as being superior to non-autistic people. That kind of stuff is why I try not to bother with those subs anymore.

**Getting off your phone** because your appointment is at 11, and you still have 10 minutes before you need to leave, oh and you planned to leave early so worst case you can leave a little later. 

**Sitting down to eat dinner** because you just remember that you bought a new shirt that you wanted to take a picture of to send to your group chat. 

**Getting out of bed** because that means you‚Äôll have to start getting ready for work which consists of way too many steps and you didn‚Äôt plan what you were going to take for lunch so you might as well think of that while you are in your comfy bed.

**Getting out of your hot car**, because you really really need to look something up and you‚Äôve been waiting to look it up this whole drive and also you need to see if you have any notifications, or maybe your boss got back to your email, and you really really like the song that‚Äôs playing. 

**Getting off of the couch** for no other reason than you are oscillating between interviewing yourself and going through an intense zone out session. 

Oh and finally one that‚Äôs more relatable... Do you procrastinate **doing your homework**? You‚Äôll start it tonight after dinner, right? But after dinner, your tired and it‚Äôs technically not due until tomorrow morning, so you really have time if you wake up early. 

And so you wake up early, but you procrastinate it a little longer because before you start you have to calculate how many points you can lose to still pass the class. Because maybe you can get out of doing this assignment and go back to bed.

For anyone curious, you can get more info on earning admission to ASU [here](http://ea.asu.edu).
Idk if there are similar programs at other schools, but for those in similar situations to mine, there ARE options for you out there to get back in school and succeed! It's never too late!


Tl;Dr: Did poorly in HS, failed out of college the first time around. Got into ASU through Earned Admission program with a 4.0, on my way to being an engineer!

So, like many here, I always struggled through school as a kid. I voluntarily stopped taking my meds in 9th grade because of all the stigma surrounding Adderall and ADHD in general. I was confused and just wanted to feel like myself and have fun. (Yes, my teenage rebellion was getting *off* drugs lol)

I barely squeaked by and graduated, took a gap semester (still had no idea what I wanted to do with my life at that point) and then started college. English major.
I fucked off, skipped classes, slept through them, and got put on academic probation after 2 semesters. Didn't clean up my act in semester 3, so I got the boot.

Fast forward to 2016, when I finally started to take my ADHD seriously again and got medicated. I've been on Straterra, done a lot of research (and lurking in this sub), and been managing my symptoms really well. 

In late 2019 I decided I wanted to finally go back to college and get a degree in Electrical Engineering. I'm active duty Air Force, so I researched the best online degree programs and found that Arizona State was the best option for me. Applied, and was promptly rejected. No surprise, really, since I did *horribly* in school in the past. 
But then the advisor told me about their Earned Admission program. Finish 4 of their classes with a 2.75 GPA or better and you're in. My HS GPA was 2.3 and college was so dismal I think I blocked that number from memory.

Anyway, I started that program last year, right before Covid. Here I am a year later, having just finished the program with a 4.0 GPA.

Guys, I just can't even describe how proud of myself I am. I'm fucking ecstatic! I *NEVER* thought I'd be able to get a degree after I got kicked out of college in my 20s. Now I've proved to myself that not only can I do well in school, but I can maintain a 4.0!
Now I will be an officially enrolled student there, and can begin my path toward my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering (Bring on the calculus!!)

 MY ANSWER IS ALWAYS ""NO""!
If I get out of my ""tunnel"" of hyperfocus, I am loosing it for the rest of the day. I don't care if it is 1 minute or 5 minutes - if you distracted me - I am not going back to being productive.

15,Just witnessed awesome parenting,"So I'm visiting a friend atm. He's got a 8yo daughter which is somewhat ADHDish, but neither tested nor diagnosed. So far it hadn't had much effect on her life, so they see no need to have it tested. And I Just witnessed why. 
So daughter had a task to do and went to her room to  work on it. Two h later she comes downstairs and shows my friend a thing she did. Obviously thrilled. Not the thing she was supposed to do, something else. And what does her father do? He gets thrilled too, letting her show her accomplishment in detail, hearing her out and discussing how to improve for a couple of minutes. THEN he asked her about the original task, telling her that he can understand she forgot about it doing this, but it has to be done today. So he offers her to start together on it and come back to this thrilling thing afterwards. All in a sincere and loving tone. He's upstairs right now getting her started. 
This is gold. This is how it's done. This is why they see no need for a diagnosis because they just accept her and her ways the way she is. Parenting done right.

Edit: Oh wow! This took off. Haven't seen that coming. Thank you all so much for this sweet, swwet karma, your comments and even awards. I never got awards before. Thank you so much. I thought this is just a cute little story to tell. I'm amazed.

To clear some things up because it came up a couple of times: They are definately having her tested for ADHD, just don't feel to rush it and want to do it when she's able to better understand it. His wife is a special ed teacher, so I guess they've got a plan. They just don't want her to have this label in the back of her head. But they are aware that it should be checked.

17,Adderall has reduced my anxiety so much that I was able to confront someone who was rude to me!,"So, I (23F) was diagnosed in early March and I started taking Adderall xr generic a few days later (10mg 2x a day if it matters). At first I had SO MUCH ENERGY, I was losing some excess weight, I was feeling happy and confident, and I was completely focused all day. After two weeks, the energy and focus sort of faded as I settled into the medication and I‚Äôve been thinking it wasn‚Äôt doing much and that I needed a dosage increase. Well, I was wrong because it‚Äôs definitely doing its job! 

Today I was in line at a sandwich shop when a person very rudely pushed past me and went straight to the counter. Now, there were only two people in line, me and an older lady waiting at the counter. This woman pushed past me and demanded the cashier‚Äôs attention as the older woman was waiting on her order. Generalized anxiety disorder runs in my family and I‚Äôve always suffered from very strong anxiety, even as a child. I‚Äôve never been able to reliably confront someone, even if they‚Äôve wronged me. Today, I was finally able to say something! 

The convo went something like this: 

Me: ‚ÄúExcuse me, ma‚Äôam, I‚Äôm in line.‚Äù

Her: ‚ÄúYeah, I see that. I‚Äôm here to pick something up.

M: ‚ÄúSo am I, but, as you can see, there‚Äôs a line.‚Äù 

H: *stank face* 

M: ‚ÄúSo get in line behind me.‚Äù

H: *huffed and stomped away* 

This may not seem like a big deal to most people but I‚Äôm so happy that I was able to say something!

Time blindness gives me so much anxiety.

I'm a graphic/motion designer so I often end up working with people who have no idea how I do my job. So they ask me how long something will take and I have no idea! I'm under pressure so I make up a time frame. If it's low then I've set myself up for failure, if it's high i see them blanch and think I must be shit at my job.

Then there's the occasions where they don't give me a deadline at all, but then complain and ask why something took 3 hours. I don't know? I was trying to think of good ideas for you and it takes time to make illustrations?

People always told me I'd get better at estimating the length of tasks with experience, but nah. I have absolutely no idea how neurotypicals even entertain the thought of accurate time estimation, never mind doing it successfully.

I was diagnosed WAY later in life at 33. Typical smart kid, I struggled in high-school and college. I have a professional job life seems great on the outside, and that's why I was missed. 

It feels as if there is a constant parallel between what women have been through in society and what minorities have been through in society.  My fiance is a doctor and she tells me how in medicine women and minorities have symptoms overlooked more often than white men. A black woman might tell her PCP she suspects she has an issue but will be followed up with or checked thoroughly much less than a white man. 

I think back how at age 12, age 16, age 21, age 23, age 27 I told my doctors, my therapists and everyone about my struggles and still got missed. 

At age 16 I knew I had sleep apnea,  ADHD, depression and anxiety.  My PCP ignored me and told me to ""eat healthier and exercise more""

Officially diagnosed with Sleep apnea at age 30, ADHD at 33. 

It seems to line up with how we see constant studies that black boys get sent to the principals office more often than white boys. 

A white boy struggling in school but has potential needs intervention, meanwhile the minorities have ""stress in their home life and needs discipline "" and young women struggling in high-school are told ""it's just their hormones and their period it's just a phase and will go away""

However the important thing to remember is that you are still LEARNING that lesson!

If I have screens in my room my brain will find ways to justify doing random things on them till late at night or not getting out of bed in the morning to start work until the very last minute. I KNOW THIS. However, who do you think regularly tells themselves ""it will be different this time""? This guy! I could literally have spent 2 hours on the phone that morning, learn the lesson, and got to bed later that night.... Phone in hand.

I once saw a Twitter post that cracked me up that said:

""I finally got around to doing something I've been putting off for 3 months. It took 20 minutes. I will learn absolutely nothing from this.""

I'm sure many ADHD'ers saw that and related! I think the statement, though really funny and true, is technically not the whole truth. I DID learn the lesson, I just forgot it a bit too quickly! But here is the thing, I WILL learn that lesson again!

It's demoralizing and self-defeating, and definitely adds to the noise in my ADHD brain in a very noticeable way - and as someone who was only diagnosed last year, it's easy to blame ADHD as the culprit and feel a sense of self-loathing.

Lately, I've started intercepting these thoughts in an attempt to make peace with myself - my past, my now, and my future. Interestingly, doing so has helped me recognize that the core of these thoughts - the idea that I've lost an opportunity forever - is fallacious. While *some* opportunities are time sensitive, *most* are ***not***. And even those that are can typically be substituted with something similar or even better. More importantly, I don't have to feel overwhelmed or guilty for not doing something *right now*; the only timeline that matters is the timeline I set for myself.

Keep setting goals for yourself, no matter how small (or big) and keep trying. It's never ""too late"" to do anything. Sure, self-doubt, regret, and imposter syndrome are real (and they can hurt); but don't let them control your tomorrow just because they controlled your today (or yesterday, or yester-years).

0,My ADHD girlfriend has a funny way of doing the dishes.,"All day today, I've been working in my home office and my girlfriend has been off work and doing the dishes. She started at 11am, and it's now 4pm and the dishes still aren't quite done.

11:00 am - She started the dishes after sleeping in, and decided to make some tea to help her get energized. It was a new type of tea so she brought the mug in to give me a taste. She sat down to sip it and a cat sat on her lap so she had to stay for a bit.

12:00 pm - Dishes are briefly resumed. I get up to go for a run and mention that I've been craving donuts. When I get back, girlfriend's car is gone. She returns shortly with coffee and donuts.

1:00 pm - Girlfriend eats donuts and drinks coffee with me. She returns to the kitchen to resume dishes but instead organizes the tea shelf because we have too many teas.

2:00 pm - Girlfriend takes a shower and cleans the cat's litter box. Plays games in her phone for several minutes.

3:00 pm - Girlfriend empties dishwasher, takes out trash and brings in four bottles of wine that she forgot were sitting in her car.

4:00 pm - I'm about to get off work. Girlfriend is still doing dishes. It may have taken her five hours, and the dishes might not ever get totally done, but wow do I appreciate the effort she's making and all she does for me.",nn8ogl,8952,1.0,367,2021-05-28 21:53:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/nn8ogl/my_adhd_girlfriend_has_a_funny_way_of_doing_the/,False,False,2021,5

2,"I am sick of trying to read stuff on the internet about ADHD when seemingly over 70% of the content talks about ""your child....."" or ""children with ADHD...."".","I am a 24 year old male from the UK who got diagnosed last year. Sometimes I find myself procrastinating and start to research ADHD stuff when I become aware that I am procrastinating. I am SICK of reading yet another article or whatever presumably by someone who doesn't have ADHD starting sentences with ""if your child...."" or ""it's best to speak to your child"" or ""homework this homework that"". It makes me feel patronised, invisible, and ridiculed all at the same time. If these people are so knowledgeable about ADHD, which they claim to be, then why don't they include the word 'adult' and stop pretending we don't exist? There's this weird feeling I get where every time I see ADHD being mentioned in the context of children, I feel ignored and more importantly, as if I'm just a big baby who can't get their shit together and has to be compared to school children.

I know this is something that everyone is aware of (the fact that there is a big misconception about adult ADHD) but it still pisses me off every time. On a side note, I also don't like hearing professionals' opinion about ADHD when they don't have it themselves - it feels like we are their 'lab mice' and they have dedicated their life to studying something they will never truly understand. I know they know more than me and this is my sensitive and overly emotional side speaking but I can't help but feel like they don't really know what it's like.

UPDATE APRIL 09 2022:

I still get quite a lot of messages about this so thought I'd provide you with some insight. I posted another update 7 months ago with a bunch of info. Feel free to go through my profile and have a look for it.
I'm 6 months post treatment now and absolutely thriving after 3 years of having cancer and not knowing about it. I managed to start working only 2 months after my final infusion.
I still get scared about getting cancer again and being less fortunate this time. It has turned my into a bit of a health freak.
For those who are scared they might have lymohoma, please rest assured that it is one of the most treatable cancers out there, even at stage 4.
I can't diagnose anyone in hear, your best bet is to see your doctor. They will most likely take a biopsy, chest x-ray, blood tests etc...

5,Not enough people realize how severe ADHD can be.,"
I feel like the rise in people who think they have ADHD is a part of this. ADHD has become common and if you have ADHD you‚Äôll be compared to *X other person who has ADHD*. What I feel people have forgotten is how severe ADHD can be. I feel like ADHD is a spectrum like autism, where some people are only mildly affected by the disorder and just need pills to help them and some people are severely affected and though pills help a little they still struggle. I'm in the latter camp.

I have severe ADHD. People don‚Äôt see the struggle for motivation that goes on inside my head. They only see the mess I made, the deadline I missed, the text I forgot to respond to. They see the physical consequences of my disorder but they can‚Äôt see how much it affects me mentally. They can‚Äôt see the years of self flagellation I inflicted on myself because I felt stupid, incompetent, and worthless. They can‚Äôt see how my brain shuts itself down if it lacks something to keep it stimulated. My ADHD actually forces me to sleep if it finds something too boring. They only see how *X* person with ADHD is better than me and ask me why I can‚Äôt just be like them.",n439p2,4980,0.99,440,2021-05-03 18:20:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/n439p2/not_enough_people_realize_how_severe_adhd_can_be/,False,False,2021,5
6,I have brushed and flossed for 41 WEEKS straight!,"For the first time in my 50+ years, I am actually excited to go to the dentist today. Prior to this I had never even managed to do both for the week before or after an appointment.

I have brushed and flossed for every single one of the **287 days** since my last appointment in August.

I was so disappointed when I rescheduled my previous appointment, but they aren't as covid aware as I would like. However, it has now been 13 days since my second shot, so I'm willing to chance it.

I fully expect them to say, ""*Romecat! What are you even doing here? Obviously you went to different dentist in the interim? Stop wasting our time!*""

TL;DR  I am a dental hygiene goddess and am really, really proud of myself!!

Edit:

So, I just found out that I am the type of person who posts, *""Thank you SO much for the awards!!""*

Normally I would feel embarrassed about being so proud of (what non-ADDers consider to be) basic hygiene, but it took me 4.5 decades to get here, so....

For my fellow ADDers:

My type is off-the-charts inattentive and I wasn't diagnosed until I was 40 so I have a LOT of *""You just need to try harder,""* baggage.

I have tried 5-6 meds and have untenable side effects to them all, so I am kind of pissed off in general. LOL

Obviously, the basic answer to how I did it is, ""I just did."" But that is a completely *worthless* response.

Last year I saw someone post about flossing for 30 days in a row and I was so freaking proud of them and was pleasantly surprised by how few snarky responses there were. I thought, I could do that.

But it wasn't until my appointment last August where I was fucking mortified by how bad it had gotten that I vowed to not let that happen again.

Even though I pay for dental insurance and have 2 ""free"" cleanings and 1 ""free"" exam per year, I had not been in 5 years. I also wasted up to $10k's worth of 50% coverage. There were more than a dozen factors that lead to that, but it still makes zero sense.

I put dental floss everywhere! Both bathrooms, by the sofa in the living room *(I don't care if that sounds gross,)* and by my bed.

My bottom teeth are really crowded because I lost my retainer when I was 15--shocker! I have to use waxed and I started tying a 12"" long piece in a loop since that made it easier to reach my back teeth and less likely to shred than using a pick.

Charts don't work for me so I just kept a, *""There is no way I am breaking this streak,""* mindset. We went on an overnight trip and I packed dental floss 3 different times, just in case any went missing. A LOT of things go missing whenever I am involved.

One of my main motivations was to post here.

All of this to say that if I can do it then I really believe that you can, too!!

 

Update, per request. How it actually went down.

I managed to get there at 3pm *on the dot*\--it was 12 miles away, so it took about 20 minutes so I was already winning from the get go. LOL

Dental Hygienist *How are you doi*

Romecat ***I FLOSSED AND BRUSHED EVERY SINGLE DAY SINCE MY LAST CLEANING!!***

DH *Um, that's good, yeah, um, some people have trouble sticking to that, so um*

RC ***IT WAS 287 DAYS! I BRUSHED AND FLOSSED ON EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM!!***

DH *Okay. Would you like to take a seat?*

The cleaning was awesome! I need to focus a bit more at the base of where my teeth are really crowded, but it was a breeze.

My dentist comes in to check things out.

RC   ***I FLOSSED AND BRUSHED EVERY SINGLE DAY SINCE MY LAST CLEANING!! IT WAS 287 DAYS!!***

She was super proud of me. I'm sure she remembers how bad it was last time. She gave my teeth the once over and said, *""Everything looks great and there is nothing to follow up on. See you in 6 months!""*

12,Stop Glorifying ADHD: It's Not A Superpower or a Gift,"I can't stand the amount of misinformation about ADHD I've been seeing on TikTok and social media lately. It's great that social media is making people realize they might have ADHD however, there are a lot of things that people say about ADHD that are just wrong or downright harmful. The amount of people that are self-diagnosing because they can listen to a video and comprehend it at 2x speed is crazy.  Or self-diagnosing because they can speak quickly.  These people are literally describing it as a quirky cute disorder that impacts their life in a positive way to the extent of describing it as a superpower and glorifying the symptoms. 

I was just watching this pretty big YouTuber's most recent upload where she talks about being diagnosed with ADHD. She describes it as a superpower and she's anti-medication because she doesn't want to lose her ""sparkle"" I guess.  It just hurts to hear someone with such a big platform that I adore spreading misinformation/that mindset about something that has inhibited every aspect of so many people's lives. Especially people who have gone undiagnosed for such a long-time.  

In my own life, my ignorant parents who don't believe in disorders did not want me to go seek help (despite recognizing the symptoms of ADHD in me) and get a diagnosis because they believed in the same thing this YouTuber was saying. I've spent countless nights and days feeling defeated wondering why I couldn't just DO things like everyone else. 

ADHD has made so many people's lives so hard that if you do not get help for it, you can develop depression, anxiety, and a whole list of other issues which makes dealing with ADHD a lot more difficult.

All the things I've always thought I ""hated"" doing like cooking, grocery shopping, detailed planning, or even driving in some cases, I actually disliked because they require an uncomfortable level of concentration and focus and not because of the activity itself.","Take cooking for example. I'm not a bad cook by any means and sometimes I do get more into it than other times but most of the time, if you asked me, I would say I really dislike cooking. But that never ""feels"" right to me. I don't think I really mind the activity itself all that much at all. In fact, I like working with my hands. 

But what I really hate is the concentration and planning involved in it. I hate having to sit at a desk and plan out meals. I hate getting a grocery list together because its basically paperwork for your personal life and its tedious and its boring. I hate going grocery shopping because I try to shop ""perfectly"" so I don't forget something and have to back track 5 rows back like I always end up doing anyway. I hate the planning required to optimize my way through the store in such a way I don't forget stuff. And then when it comes to actually cooking, I don't like needing to meticulously think through each step before I even start to make sure I don't screw anything up. I hate having to juggle several different things cooking all at once. Don't forget this item or it'll burn. Did I stir that one thing enough? Did I forget something in the oven again?

18,There is no base of emotional state you can return to and I think that's one of the most serious adhd symptoms existing,"Whenever I'm happy, I can't remember why I was sad. Whenever I'm sad, I can't imagine to be happy again unless I sleep over it. When I am super mad about something that happened so that I want to delete it out of my life, I will not be able to remember it when I am happy again. In the happy mood I would play it down and say ""it was just a depressive phase it's not that important""... Every. Single. Fcking. Time... 

There is just no base to return to where you are able to remember all those things that disturb your life or you want to add to your life and you are happy at the same time. I mean remembering is the wrong word, you just wont take it serious anymore when you are happy. 

Boys and girls trust me this is the most disturbing part about adhd. I would be such a successful person if I could combine those two moods. All of us would be!

19,I‚Äôm so tired of putting in 3x the amount of normal work into existing and still ending up 10 steps behind everyone.,"I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child but my mom didn‚Äôt take it seriously enough and so I wasn‚Äôt ever put on medication. I think she mostly just assumed I was stubborn and lazy and I would eventually grow out of it.

I‚Äôm 25 now and I feel like not being medicated early on in life has set me back in so many ways. I struggle to keep up with simple tasks like brushing my teeth everyday or making sure I drank water at least once. I‚Äôve been working on the same associate‚Äôs degree for like 3 years and barely made any progress because taking more than two classes at a time is a monumental struggle. I still live with my grandparents.

I try to give myself props for little victories. Like, ‚Äúhey girl, you brushed your teeth today and put in lotion and brought the cups down from your room that have been sitting there for a week, good for you!‚Äù But it‚Äôs hard when you see people around you getting the ‚Äúbig victories‚Äù. 

Ya know, the house, the car, the job, the new baby and the new marriage.

I know I need to be medicated but even just calling to make the appointment to see a physician is like some impossible, other worldly task. It really sucks and it‚Äôs so hard to convey this sort of struggle to neurotypical people.

26,"It was nice knowing all of you guys on r/ADHD, my psychiatrist revoked my ADHD diagnosis.","For context: I'm a 17 year old female student who takes the IB and gets good grades somehow

Just when I hit a hundred karma on this other post I made about an ADHD struggle, my psychiatrist has told me that my ADHD diagnosis is not a priority and that based on the answered questionnaires from my teachers, my mom, and me, it was very inconsistent -- shifting from elevated score of hyperactivity to inattention or to no problems at all. This lack of clarity basically made my psychiatrist doubtful about me ADHD which is literally the opposite of how he acted when I first talked about my struggles and problems. He literally said and I quote ""There's a 95% chance of you having ADHD. You're like the textbook definition of ADHD."" Then here comes the questionnaire answers with ALL of my teachers being like ""What? ADHD? The student doesn't have any problems at all! We have no concerns! The grades are great!"" And I just can't help but feel like my struggles are being invalidated just because my teachers think I'm so organized and so driven when in fact I do ALL of my work in the last minute, I have consistent bursts of energy when it comes to work, I am only driven by interest, I forget my deadlines or I PURPOSELY do my work an hour before a deadline for the adrenaline to kick in and actually START DOING WORK. BUT OF COURSE! OF COURSE! THEY DON'T KNOW THAT BECAUSE I PUT UP A FRONT! Because they think I'm so polite and I have NO PROBLEMS! NO PROBLEMS AT ALL! I have been suffering and it's not just now because I'm in an academically rigorous program, I have struggled with this since primary school when I've struggled to do my tasks on time and actually get the work done. But of course! They all think it's depression! Anxiety! OCD!

Not only that, I have spent the entire year so far researching about ADHD from scholarly articles to endless hunts of ADHD related posts on social media. As a kid, my mom even told me that a doctor told her I was displaying symptoms of ADHD. I have created a 15,000 word research report on ADHD and how much this related to all of my symptoms in my life. I was looking forward to sharing everything with my psychiatrist but I didn't even get a chance to, it took me five months to actually see a psychiatrist to consult him about ADHD. If I look further back, it took me five years to actually visit a mental health professional consistently. I've endlessly came to this subreddit back and forth for some comfort since somehow with this community, I felt less alone and something made sense about me for once. That was a long rant but I guess this is it lol. I don't have ADHD. I guess I'm just a lazy motherfucker AHAHAH. I hate myself. So so so much. I'm already mentally ill as it is but I actually and genuinely thought ADHD was the answer to why I'm just like this. I feel terrible but thank you r/ADHD for at least making me feel validated and seen somehow, even though it isn't like that anymore.

Do you guys know that Tiktok sound ""I'm everything you always wanted to be, let's deal with the issue, you wish you were me"" ? Well that's me right now with the most popular ADHD stereotype: a young hyperactive boy who disrupts lessons and makes endless noise because I'm just the perfectionistic teenage girl who is overly ambitious but can't actually do shit because she's lazy. Thank you for reading. This was pretty long and ugh. I'm so done. I'm so tired. But thank you for this subreddit. For real, in some way I really felt less alone. Thank you.

28,I think I found a way to explain neurotypical people who‚Äôs like with adhd,"The other day my therapist told me to come with an analogy to explain my adhd to neurotypical people, and this what I came up with:

Imagine you have a laptop, like everyone else. 

Yes, everyone‚Äôs laptops tend to freeze once in a while, or it runs slower when you have too much stuff going on, consuminabout 6 of your 8 GB of ram. Or start overheating a little if  you use it like + 12 hours straight. And if you get a major complication, you can just change the parts, expand the RAm or memory, or even get a new one. 

But this laptop has like 2 GB of RAM, tends to overheat all the time, has 50 tabs in simultaneous with you CAN‚ÄôT close, no matter how many times you try, and it takes like 50 tries before it lets you save the word document you were writing. It even erases some of your documents without warning, and there‚Äôs almost no way of getting them back. It freezes all the time and, if you force it too much, it will overheat and turn off. You need to let it cool of before you can use it back. 

Even worse, there‚Äôs a 3 year old kid you have to share it with. There‚Äôs just that stupid laptop for the two of you. That kid doesn‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre working in something important, it will make a tantrum and try to take it from you because they can. And whenever they try to use the computer, they want to use it to play games, or watch something on YouTube, or something unrelated to whatever you‚Äôre doing. And when the computer freezes or runs off, they will make a big tantrum and you can‚Äôt calm them down.  

Most people would say ‚Äúbut why don‚Äôt you get a new laptop?‚Äù And the answer is: you can‚Äôt. That laptop you got came with lots of factory defects, and they won‚Äôt let you change it. You just have to learn to work with it. YOU are the one who has to work around the laptop, not the other way. AND you gotta deal with that stupid kid, because you have to share it with them. It is YOU who has to learn how to deal with them, since they won‚Äôt listen to you.

When I get to take my meds, it‚Äôs like I get to put the computer in a stand  that has a refrigeration system. It won‚Äôt overheat as fast, and it starts to run more smoothly. It will finally let you close those unnecessary tabs, it won‚Äôt freeze instantly, and you can almost save your files without having to try it 59 times. Just one or two times is enough. Your data won‚Äôt be erased without warning. And it won‚Äôt reset every five minutes. You can almost use it like a normal laptop, and get your work done.

It also gives that stupid 3 years old kid a candy, so he won‚Äôt bother you for a while. You can finally use it for yourself, and give all your attention to your tasks. 

The only thing is that please please please please PLEASE don‚Äôt bother the kid. He‚Äôs calm right now, so don‚Äôt agitate him. It‚Äôs super difficult to get him to listen to you at least ONCE. Just let me enjoy those hours of calmness.

29,I got into Law School!,"I was diagnosed at the ripe age of 39 after my daughter was diagnosed.  I can say that treatment has literally changed my life.

So now, at the age of 41 I have been accepted into a part time law school program and I think I might actually be able to achieve the dream that I set out to do in my 20's.

I am beyond grateful.

&#x200B;

**ETA:** Oh my goodness!  Thank you all for such kind words!  And also thank you for all the awards!

Some folks have asked what treatment I am receiving so the short answer is I'm on meds.  Specifically Adderall XR.  I've been on the same dosage for a year now and it works well for me.  

The long answer is I was undiagnosed for soooo long that I had developed a lot of coping strategies.  39 years of trial and error.  I went back to school when our family lost our business in 2014 for a post baccalaureate paralegal certification class.  I graduated from that program with a 4.0 and there were some things that really helped when I was unmedicated.    

1. I would always sit up front.  I just could get too easily distracted in the back.  I'm not trying to be a gunner my first year but I know I'll be sitting up front because daggummit I will get distracted by the fact that the person in front of me has their shirt tag sticking out.  

2. White noise or rain sounds in my noise cancelling headphones when I had to study or was in the middle writing a brief or memo.  I could really get in the zone with that.  

3. Someone mentioned not using a laptop because it's too easy to get distracted and I have to say I agree.  I looooove my Rocket notebook and so I'll probably continue to use that when I get into law school.  I was intrigued about using a iPad with the writing stylus but I think I'll just stick to my Rocket Notebook.  It's reusable and I can scan with my phone to upload into my OneDrive Account with specific folders for classes.  

I will probably will need to start seeing my therapist again on a regular basis so I can keep some perspective during this whole thing.  I know it's going to be a long slog but I know I can do it.  My Mom went back to become and ARNP in her late 30's, early 40's and she's still practicing and loving it and she had 4 kids!  I only have two and my in-laws live with us so I have lots of help with the day to day stuff for the kiddos.  Not to mention my husband is an absolute domestic rock-star (once I graduate, he'll most likely go down to P/T at his job so he can be at home more with the kids and his parents which is A-OK by me!)  

Once again, thank you all so much!  Your encouragement means a lot and just know that I'm rooting for all of you as well who are doing ""hard things"" even with this wonky diagnosis.  You all rock!

30,To the students who mock our professor with ADHD,"Thank you, I‚Äôm quite decided against teaching because I certainly don‚Äôt want to deal with such mean, unempathetic students like you. 

Yes, I know you don‚Äôt know he has ADHD (he mentioned it to me when he saw my accommodations), but that shouldn‚Äôt stop you from treating him as a human. 

Do you really have to make such a huge fuss that he didn‚Äôt answer your email? Can‚Äôt you just send a follow up or attend office hours? Do you need to equate lateness with low intelligence?

Yes, he‚Äôs not the best teacher, but have you noticed he goes out of the way to explain when you ask questions? Why don‚Äôt you, for once, unmute yourself and ask him questions about what you‚Äôre confused about rather than bi**hing that get meaner and meaner every passing day? 

Do you really have to make personal attacks and escalate all minor failures into one big ball?

You bunch are just not cool.

EDIT: 

Since this is coming up in comments: I‚Äôm not saying professors should be excused for bad teaching because they have ADHD. I‚Äôm essentially saying:

1. Professors are humans too. It doesn‚Äôt hurt to cut a little slack for a late email, and follow up. I request (always granted) deadline extensions; why can‚Äôt I give my professor some grace by not expecting an immediate reply? Or there‚Äôs always office hours if he‚Äôs specially unresponsive. 

2. There‚Äôs a difference between constructive criticism vs borderline bullying. Frustrated with a teacher? Well and fair, I myself write wordy evals. Using him as the butt of jokes? Nope. Making out everything he does as a mistake? Nope.",nh1li3,2798,0.99,222,2021-05-20 14:24:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/nh1li3/to_the_students_who_mock_our_professor_with_adhd/,False,False,2021,5
31,Do you mask a ‚Äútoned-down‚Äù version of your own personality around others in fear of everyone else thinking your real self is ‚Äúweird‚Äù or ‚Äútoo much to handle‚Äù,"Ever since maybe, idk, high school, when people started to ‚Äúmature‚Äù as they took on adult responsibilities, I feel I‚Äôve had to ‚Äútone down‚Äù my personality quite a lot to fit society‚Äôs adult standards and match the other people around me. I feel like I‚Äôm going to be judged by everyone for acting myself and be seen as immature or overly hyper regardless of how responsible I actually am. 

I‚Äôm graduating college this semester, and at this point I‚Äôve been putting up the front for so long I feel like I‚Äôve forgotten who I really am at this point. When I find people I feel like I CAN be myself around, something inside me feels compelled from expressing that, and I find myself masking around everyone, all the time, including family.

I don‚Äôt want to sound defeatist but I can honestly say this has been the case personally. I‚Äôm awful at feigning interest in things and I find it almost impossible to invest beyond the bear minimum with something I have no attachment to.

Allah knows.

Don‚Äôt burden your soul with guilt. Guilt that shouldn‚Äôt be there to begin with.

Don‚Äôt feel sad if you barley fasted this Ramadan because ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá would rather we stay mentally stable instead of burdening ourselves. Adhd might not be made out to seem all that bad of a disorder. But we know the downward spiral we get into if we miss a dosage or the constant obsession over food which makes Ramadan that much harder for us.

All that matters is that you prayed your salah, made your duas, paid your zakah(charity) and contributed to the masjid/ and or society.

0,Emotional dysregulation is a major but overlooked of part of ADHD.,"Everyone knows about the impulsivity, hyperactivity, time blindness, and general sort of chaos that people think of when they hear about ADHD. 

But the largest and maybe the most debilitating symptom for me is a complete inability to regulate my emotions. I don't feel anything halfway, everything stings more than it should and it's exhausting. If I'm happy I feel like I can do absolutely anything, and if I'm sad it physically hurts and I'm unable to let it go for a VERY for long time. It's not surprising at all that many people are misdiagnosed as bipolar instead of ADHD, yet no one really talks about this painful symptom; the ability to feel paralyzed by emotions while others can feel the same thing and get over it in no time. :(",ntrhqy,4858,1.0,501,2021-06-06 17:58:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ntrhqy/emotional_dysregulation_is_a_major_but_overlooked/,False,False,2021,6

3,"I just finished three highschool classes at age 30. Started highschool at age 15, dropped out, almost finishing twice, dealing with depression, failure, failed attempts and more in the past 15 years. And now for the first time: I am god damn proud of myself!","Hi :)  
Sorry for the rant, I just feel like sharing :)  
**TL:DR at the bottom**

I've tried finishing highschool (what is equivalent in Denmark) since I was 15 (in 2005). I was 3 months from finishing the 3 years, when I dropped out because I broke down. It was the worst years of my life at that point. Later (when I was 21) I was retroactively diagnosed with clinical depression from the age of 15. When I was 19, I tried finishing a 2 year compressed high school course, and that's when my depression really hit me, and I stopped attending with 4 months left. I was living on my own, and I basically hid for a few months in my apartment. After that I was diagnosed with depression and started on anti-depressants etc. A couple of times I tried taking a online courses to finish the subjects I was missing to get the full diploma, but I couldn't get through them. I've had nightmares of sitting in classrooms, the stress of having assignments due that I couldn't get done and all that stuff.

Fast forward to 2018. Working full time as a sales assistant in a retail store. I started cutting down on my antidepressants on my own, and finally in December 2018 I stopped, without withdrawals.  
4 months later I meet the girl of my dreams, and I got myself a girlfriend. I felt good. But I had a hard time relaxing, focusing and anxiety from too much talk, and thoughts about the future. Fast forward again to 2020. I decide, with my girlfriend's support, to slowly start taking a couple of courses online, so I can get my diploma. I'd start with 3 classes, two of the biggest, and one easier one: English (advanced foreign language), Danish (literature - biggest subject of all, in highschool), and Geography (introduction). These are all compressed 1-year courses. I start in September. But I am still stressed, anxious... my brain is overworked. Not because of the courses, but because of everything.  
In February I make an appointment with my doc, and after a talk she refers me to a psychiatrist and soon I am diagnosed with ADHD(ADD), I start taking my Ritalin (later Concerta), and later some Sertralin for my anxiety. It all works - it's awesome!!! LUCKILY because I of the Covid-19 situation most exams are cancelled, and I just have to have a casual conversation with some of the teachers, so they can assess a grade from the conversation and all my assignments. For 10+ years I've feared exams, and feared all of this... I've avoided it at all cost. ""Sadly"" it turns out that the Danish oral exam and written exam are not cancelled, because of the sheer size and importance of the class. It's hard, and my biggest fear tbh.

I know I'm decent at English, but I suck at the formalities, and at limiting my answers and understanding the questions, because I overanalyse everything. So I had no idea about what grades I would get.  
Geography I'm good at, since I like everything scientific and fact-based. But my teacher apparently didn't understand my reasoning in my reflection when I talked to her because I do a LOT of reflection. So I guess it can be confusing to people who don't.  
Danish I figured I would get a mediocre grade. I only read what was required to do the assignments, and I suck at remembering the formalities, and analyses, what to focus on etc. So I always have to start over, with every new assignment. I panicked when I found out I had to do an oral exam.

First was the written danish exam. 5 hours. I had planned my time, and what kind of assignment I would chose. The first hour I would use on reading the texts, form my opinion, and get ready to discuss the subject. The next three I would spend on writing, and the last hour I would use to read through the assignment and make corrections. At the exam... I spent the first 2,5 hours reading, analysing, forming an opinion, and get an idea of what to write... then I spent 1 hour trying to write, but I was stuck. Then I had a breakthrough and I spent 1,5 hours writing, and the last 5 minutes I got the formalities (headline, page number etc), but I never read it over or anything :o

Next was the oral exam... I had great plans to read up on all the subjects, but it was more of a quick glance at the curriculum. Then came the day, where I had my first REAL oral exam... I was sure I was going to fuck it up, but at least it would be over soon! I had feared this in all the years since I was 15... now 30.  
When I get there I drink some energy drink, my mind is all over...  
I go in to meet the examiners, and I play it as cool as I possibly can, make a joke, smile etc.  
I pull the question and the text, and get 50-60 minutes to prepare. I have no idea about what to do. I spent 40 minutes reading about the genre, and 15 minutes analysing the text.  
I come back in to the exam, and I start talking... I talk, I talk... after a while they ask me some questions, I have NO idea what to answer... But I talk and pretend... And suddenly the 30 minutes are up. I go outside and think... at least it's all over and I can do with a D or a C... after only 10 seconds they ask me to come back in.  
And immediately say: ""Well obviously you get an A!""  
I'm dumbfounded. What the fuck... I start laughing and I say ""WHAT? A? I thought maybe a C?"" but they assure me, I nailed it.  
I honestly can't believe it. How can I, someone who has had a deep fear of everything related to this, get the best possible grade in the subject I find the hardest?! For the first time since I can remember I felt proud! I had a real success! A feeling we rarely get with our ADHD brains... I called my girlfriend, she starts crying. I call my mom and my dad, they get so happy.

A few days later (yesterday) I get the grades for my other classes! Geography: A, English Oral: A, English Written: B and Danish Written: B!!!!  
I honestly can't believe it!! I had never ever thought I would be able to do this good! I've never lived up to my potential before, but I thought grades like that was unreachable for someone with my brain...  
I am proud of myself! I don't feel proud or happy all the time... but for a few seconds sometimes, I get a burst of a feeling I haven't felt before. Proudness! It's crazy.

Now, for the next year I'm going to take more classes, and cut down on work :) And after NEXT summer I'll start getting my bachelors degree.

*""For those whose ADD was not diagnosed and treated until they became grown-ups, the magnetism of past experience keeps bringing them back to old habits and old states of mind, even if they have received the best treatment available.*

*They are haunted by fears of failure, even if they have succeeded many times. They are still tormented by feelings of insecurity, even if they are objectively as secure as any human can be.

5,I have realized that environment plays a HUGE roll in my ADHD severity. Working on a farm is the PERFECT job for my ADHD brain. Who woulda thought.,"So I started interning on a farm a few weeks ago. 

Before that, I had been unemployed for a few years (due to mental health & lack of decisive direction) though I always had a side hustle selling online, so I always had at least a small source of income. But I digress.

Since starting on this farm, my ADHD symptoms (mainly forgetfulness & inability to focus on what I have to do) have lessened in severity immensely. 

Not sure if it‚Äôs due to the lack of overstimulation (at home, I live on a busy street and I‚Äôm a highly sensitive person to begin with, so I get overwhelmed very easily by noises and movement, but at this farm it‚Äôs 10 acres of land where you don‚Äôt hear any [car] noises or other distractions, so it‚Äôs easier to focus), or if it‚Äôs the lack of burnout because every day is different. Because for me, with anything I do, I burn out easily because it becomes to repetitive & ‚Äòboring‚Äô for my brain, so I become less focused on it by the day. 

But here on a farm, you do something different every day. You‚Äôre not as rushed, you don‚Äôt have to check in and leave at a certain time (I‚Äôm living here on the farm), and they show you how to do everything so you understand it visually instead of just verbally. It‚Äôs honestly so perfect.

I‚Äôm also someone who prefers to work with their hands instead of their head. Probably because I could never rely fully on my brain remembering the correct things, and have always been a natural hard worker (always helping with building & repairing things around the house growing up). And i guess you could say my brain is pretty decent at coming up with ideas/solutions on a whim. So working on a farm is like the perfect environment for my type of brain. 

Just thought I should share in case someone else was struggling with not knowing if it‚Äôs their environment worsening their ADHD symptoms. Like I honestly have felt so much more confident in my self since these few weeks of being here, which I have never felt confident in myself, like ever.

6,The two states of an ADHD relationship: obsessing over someone OR forgetting they exist,"It seems that ADHD leaves me with two modes of operating when it comes to relationships; hyperfixation and obsession over someone - giving them the keys to the kingdom of your mind so they can worm their way into almost every thought. Naturally this leads to some very off putting behaviour. 

Or an almost total lack of conscious thought until you realise you‚Äôve gone weeks without contacting somebody you‚Äôre supposed to be friends with, perhaps even romantically entwined. 

Like the Morton‚Äôs fork dilemma this makes it near impossible to hold down healthy relationships because the other party either feels smothered or forgotten, or constantly crushed between the two extremes. 

Setting reminders helps to stay mindful, but it‚Äôs still an uphill battle and it‚Äôs yet another addition to the litany of damages caused by the disorder.

8,No One Ever Talks About This Part of Needing Medication for ADHD,"No one ever talks about being a female that wants to start a family and having to get off medication.

No one.

No one mentions how as you slowly get off (per help from your doctor) the first few weeks of each lowering dosage is full of lack of motivation, joy, and energy.

No one talks about how you realize your symptoms of ADHD are actually still there, and the little tips and tricks you learned over the years don't work as well with lower executive functioning.

No one talks about how the depression and anxiety you had before your diagnosis slowly creeps back in due to the constant reappearance of accidental self-sabotaging habits.

No one mentioned this part out of all the years I've been in the ADHD community, and I feel slightly bitter about it because SO many people are ADVOCATES for medication, but no one seems to mention this small reality for women wanting to start a family.

If you fall into this category, I want you to know that I wish I had known more about this part of the process. It is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT at times to handle, especially since I'm used to a certain flow that I can no longer keep up with.

Do I feel like this all the time? No. Are certain things better as I lower my medication? Yes.

But do I constantly find myself back to where I started because I'm struggling way more than I did while on medication?

Absolutely, and that f\*\*\*ing sucks.

10,I‚Äôm so sick of falling in love with and obsessing over anyone who gives me the slightest positive attention. Especially if they‚Äôre married or unavailable.,"I eternally rotate between being emotionally unavailable and happily single, and totally obsessed with anyone who gives me any sort of attention. I will fantasize a life with them, flirt with them, kiss their ass, become hyper sexual, and then as quickly as it starts, I become ashamed, distant, and uninterested.  

It makes it even worse if they‚Äôre married, older than me, or in a position of power, they become 1000x more attractive to me if I can‚Äôt have them. I just think the notion of meeting someone available, getting to know them, and mutually agreeing to be attracted to each other is terrifying. What if they find out about my self-esteem issues? About how hard it is to take care of myself and my life? About how difficult it is to sustain interpersonal relationships?   

Ugh I just wish I could do this one thing normally, especially when I think I would be an amazing partner to someone?   

Help!

Edit: wow, I‚Äôm amazed at some of these replies and I‚Äôm so happy that people relate to this! Some people have mentioned that this could be due to emotional trauma and attachment styles, but I know it‚Äôs exaggerated tenfold by adhd. I didn‚Äôt think I was a person who had trauma or that it even affected my life, but I see now how that‚Äôs totally wrong. I just find it easier to sabotage myself than to be vulnerable. Thanks again to everyone who left a comment!!

Edit 2:

This could also very well be a manifestation of bpd and not necessarily something that someone with just adhd might experience. It‚Äôs valuable to post to this subreddit because bpd is a common comorbidity of adhd, symptoms frequently overlap, and many people will still relate to this. I might struggle with some symptoms of bpd, but it does not 100% explain the struggles many of us deal with inattention/hyperactivity/impulsivity/executive function issues etc. The two are not mutually exclusive, and it is often not just one or the other. Thanks for invalidating me.

That‚Äôs not to say everyone who is open about their ADHD or makes jokes about it is immediately faking, in fact that‚Äôs the last thing I want to assume about someone who says they have ADHD. However, every single person who is most likely faking romanticizes it so much that most of their ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù are either symptoms that most non-ADHD people experience to some extent or literal misinformation

ADHD is not occasionally zoning out, being hyper, or liking to play with fidget toys, and it especially isn‚Äôt blinking to the beat of TikTok audios (I can‚Äôt believe I had to add that either, but apparently it‚Äôs a thing)

ADHD is not being able to do basic tasks efficiently most of the time because you‚Äôre not able to focus on them

ADHD is forgetting things often

ADHD is having to stim or not being able to sit still to where it‚Äôs annoying for you and/or others around you

ADHD is having sensory issues

ADHD is having trouble sleeping

ADHD is having poor organization skills

13,I just had a neurologist tell me I have to learn to live with my adhd/stc instead of meds - I walked out,"Edit: wow so many amazing responses. I have put in a complaint. I will try take it further. I‚Äôll update how the new one goes on the weekend. If it‚Äôs not good it looks like I‚Äôll leave this clinic. I mean, I can‚Äôt get any more solid diagnosis with my issues. If a 50 page medical file detailing all my scans and treatment and evaluation isn‚Äôt enough I don‚Äôt know what else I can do but find somewhere else...

But I hope my complaint raises some flags and can help stop this happening to other people. We should not in any way be made to feel like adhd or any cognitive issue is made up and should be learnt to live with. Acne gets treated with medication, depression gets treated with medication - yes of course lifestyle snd therapy are also to be used in conjunction with treatment as it also helps. But adhd needs to have the same value as all these other issues and we should never be made to feel like we are crazy and don‚Äôt deserve help. 

I‚Äôve been on this sub for a while. I‚Äôm writing this post to remind anyone who this happens to - don‚Äôt take it. 

Even with my limited options on my insurance - I won‚Äôt stop until I find someone who listens - living with adhd can be so hard and to be treated like this is not on. She was so rude and acted like I was making it all up despite having all this proof. I‚Äôve gone through so many docs and appointments to be rejected and told no, it‚Äôs been super hard. For me to have even got a referral to my old neurologist to begin with took months and months! 

I had suspected adhd all my life since a young child, but was diagnosed a couple years back after reacting well to Adderall at a party. I went to a doc and did the evaluation etc

I went one step further and started seeing a neurologist who sent me for these great scans and got me on 10mg of Adderall. My brain scans and tests (evox) showed the severity of my adhd and that I had something called CDD/STC as well (it‚Äôs like adhd‚Äôs cousin - it can affect short term memory and make you day dream) 

My scans also showed me that I had a brain injury/concussion years ago (when I was a teen) that it has affected my front lobe area - basically between my adhd/cdd/BI - I lose stuff haha 

Anyway my old neurologist was great, he referred me to a neuropsychologist which I still can‚Äôt find one to get into due to wait times, to help me deal with my CDD/STC and ADHD better and I was finally excited about getting somewhere after a year and half of docs dragging their feet. 

Then he suddenly left I think due to a sudden illness last week and they replaced me with a new neurologist who I saw today. I was worried as it has been so hard to finally find him, you have no idea. My insurance is limited and I‚Äôve spent a year and half trying to get this stuff sorted. No one before him could help me properly find out what was going on. The clinic reassured me this new neurologist was good. 

Now I‚Äôm not sure if I can mention names but I won‚Äôt for now, but if anyone with any form of depression or is really struggling with the adhd in NYC do not see this doctor. PM for the name

I went in, expecting her to look at my solid diagnosis from my scans to my referral to my letter my neurologist has written up very clearly stating I have severe adhd / cdd and a brain injury and have responded well to medication so far and we are trialing things and my history of meds, therapy, etc. 

I sat down and said I was thinking of either changing to another type of ADHD medication or upping my Adderall to 15mg as I have felt 10mg isn‚Äôt sufficient over the last 6 months. My old neurologist suggested 20mg and he was going to to change it at my next appointment but obviously left before we changed it. I also wanted to talk to her about a little seizure I had last week and my struggle with finding a neuropsychologist. 

The new neurologist, looked at my file and said you are an adult, stop using adhd as an excuse in life, all you people out there think you need medication - I will not give any medication to anyone over 18. I do not believe in adhd. 

I said excuse me? I mentioned my tests results, my literal brain scans that tested me while I was on Adderall and off. My brain tests that two neurologists officially diagnosed me with these in detail.

I said I have been on medication for years, how do expect me to deal with it if you won‚Äôt give me my medication? She said you just have to learn to learn to live with it like a normal person. Deal with my brain injury naturally. She said something about cantaloupe. And less stress. 

I said go fuck your self, thanks for nothing and walked out 

I went straight to the front desk and said I will put in a formal complaint later but please give me a doctor who actually believes in science and adhd - I said she should not be practising - she knew exactly what I meant and apologized and supposedly booked me in on the weekend to a neurologist who can actually help me 

I‚Äôm lucky I‚Äôm not going through a mentally hard time but I would hate for someone with adhd who is struggling to be stuck with this doctor and not feel the strength to stick up for my self like I did. Actually me a year ago would have left that room crying and feeling more fragile

16,I think I learned to repress my emotions because my family thought it was hilarious when I would get angry or upset as a child.,"TLDR: my family laughed at me getting unproportionally angry or upset when I was a child, while I just felt guilty and ashamed.

I am not diagnosed with ADHD, but after struggling with concentration and getting things done in time a psychologist suggest that my problems sound a lot like ADHD.
Anyway, I was a bit perplexed at first but after doing some research and also reading a lot of posts here, the descriptions really resonated with me.
The latest symptoms that really fascinated me were emotional dysregulation and rejection sensitivity. I have always felt like I was more sensitive to criticism and even when I knew it was well-intentioned and constructive, I immediately became defensive, angry and couldn‚Äôt let go of it, even after a while. Still I always tried my best to never publicly show any ‚Äúbad‚Äù emotions. I don‚Äôt get angry or yell, I never cry in front of others. 
Then, recently I watched a YouTube video by How to ADHD on emotional dysregulation, and it was mentioned that children with ADHD get reprimanded for strong emotional responses much more and develop strategies such as repressing emotions, avoiding uncomfortable situations and being a people pleaser early on.
It reminded me that as a child I was very emotional and would extremely angry which was not in proportion to the situation. (I once smashed a plate with a spoon when I was 7 because I didn‚Äôt want to eat more broccoli. I was also a very sore loser.)But the shitty part is that I remember this instances because my family kept telling these stories and finding them hilarious. Every time they would tell a story, I felt guilty and ashamed.
I am sure that they didn‚Äôt mean to hurt me but the whole situation is pretty fucked up now that I think about it.
I am trying to unlearn that behavior now and letting myself be okay with showing emotions but it‚Äôs not easy.

22,My mom reacted horribly to finding out about my ADHD and it‚Äôs affecting me more than I want to let on,"I just got diagnosed with ADHD-C at age 37 and am working with a psychiatrist on figuring out treatment (results have been mixed so far, but that‚Äôs not what I came to post about). I haven‚Äôt told my mom about it because she tends to react strongly and I suspected she wouldn‚Äôt be a good source of support. 

Yesterday she overheard my sister and I talking about it and completely flipped out. More than I had anticipated. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have that! They will diagnose *anyone* with that! You do NOT have that!‚Äù I pointed out that the board certified professional I‚Äôm working with disagreed with her on that, as did I, the person who actually lives inside my brain. She was completely unreachable on this. 

Had to kind of shrug it off and change the subject, but it‚Äôs affected me more than I wanted to let on to anyone, including myself. I felt numb and disconnected from my family for the remainder of my visit, and once I got home and could relax a bit my mind is swirling with self doubt about my diagnosis and pursuing treatment. I‚Äôm even feeling doubts about whether ADHD even exists, despite all the research I‚Äôve done reading work by people far more knowledgeable and experienced than I am. 

I struggle with understanding/trusting my perceptions,  even regarding my own brain, which is why after years of flip flopping on this I decided to pay out of pocket for a psychiatrist (options were limited in my area thanks to the shitty US health care system). And yet, my imposter syndrome has not been cured despite being validated by an experienced licensed professional! 

Thanks to anyone who read this far, it was super helpful just to type this out and put words to how I‚Äôm feeling. Grateful for this forum.

UPDATE: wow, was blown away by this response. Thanks to everyone who took the time to comment or send me a DM, and I‚Äôm glad that this post was able to serve as a springboard for others to process their loved ones‚Äô reactions. 

I texted my mom this morning and let her know that I felt hurt and invalidated by her response, and that I‚Äôd appreciate her educating herself before commenting on my ADHD. She apologized right away and admitted she had a lot of misconceptions and said she is trying to learn! We had a good and productive conversation about ADHD and some of my own struggles. (Interestingly, she related some things I mentioned to herself... I‚Äôm going to let her walk her own path with that one) 

Feeling so much better!! Side note: I think being on meds specifically helped me initiate this conversation- in the before times I believe I would have avoided it or obsessed over how to phrase my text to her, instead of easily finding words that were phrased as gentle I statements.

23,Climbing out of depression has made me realize ADHD is the root cause which puts me in a negative spiral," I've dealt with severe depression but through treatment and therapy I've overcome this extremely well to the point I've literally never felt better. I've known I'm ADHD but always thought of it as a minor inconvenience in the face of more severe issues that needed immediate attention. 

 I thought my tiredness was because of depression. I've never been happier in my whole life but the waves of exhaustion don't end. I thought that my depression made me lazy it turns out I'm not lazy it's executive dysfunction. My self esteem issues grew not only from personal trauma but setting impossibly high standards for myself. Thinking back I remember my first B as a kid and how my failure to achieve perfection meant my educational future was pointless every report card reinforcing my failure.  My failure to create a perfect organizational system meant my backpack looked like a trashcan because where would I put the individual papers? Pursuing any passion was impossible because I first needed to know the exact perfect way to begin creating such a high threshold for entry that it makes doing minor things incredibly hard. It's easier hiking 30 miles down a new trail than it is to pick up the plate that fell underneath my bed because getting it invariably means I'll need to organize everything in my kitchen properly. 

 This isn't a sob story I'm doing well now and seeing the issues I have and how easily they can drag me back down into the pits makes me understand I have the wisdom to face my issues I didn't have growing up. It's empowering knowing that my issues aren't a weakness of character but an issue which others face and can be overcome through effort.

24,I GOT MY DEGREE!,"Hi Guys, so I‚Äôve been in this subreddit for a while now, been waiting to make my first post, i was diagnosed as a child at around 6 years old, (25 now), having ADHD and being aware of this most of my life has always had a negative effect on my education, I am a relatively intelligent student however my work ethic and application suffered massively because of my ADHD, Im from the UK, I remember for my a-levels (college year exams) i got the lowest grades possible and had to retake the year, even then I Didn‚Äôt do well. I genuinely never believed i‚Äôd be able to complete a degree but after 3 long years of procrastination, stress, last minute dashes to complete assignments and alot of hard work i can finally say i have finished my undergraduate in BSc Business Economics! 

What I‚Äôve learned from this: all of us in this subreddit who suffer from ADHD have their own battles to face, life will never be a piece of cake and with our mental condition its ever so much harder for us to live and compete in this world. However the strength i managed to gain from reading the stories and seeing the massive positive response from all of you guys made me realise im not alone in my battles. We all have eachother, we can learn coping mechanisms , and ways to deal with ADHD from eachother and be stronger from it! I just want to say thank you to all the people who‚Äôve shared their personal stories here and to the people that have supported them, you inspired me to learn to manage my ADHD to a point where im able to say im finally a graduate, genuinely something i never thought possible! THANK YOU GUYS and heres to the next chapter!

25,Being treated like a drug addict in the emergency room bc of my ADHD meds,"I want to start off by saying that emergency room doctors shouldn't dismiss anyone's symptoms no matter if they're a drug addict or not, it was just especially infuriating when I was just taking my prescription medication in the exact way my doctors had told me to. TLDR in the bottom!

So basically, I've been having some weird visual hallucinations for maybe a year or so, it started with seeing caleidoscopic patterns on walls and ceilings when I woke up at night. They usually went away after about 5-10 minutes and I didn't think much of it.

A few weeks ago it started increasing in strength and came more and more often. I also started seeing flashes of light when I moved my head quickly, usually after working out, I saw movements in the edge of my vision(for example I kept thinking some small holes in the ceiling were crawling spiders, but when I looked directly at them the movement stopped) and I thought there was a beetle on my bf's arm cause I saw a dark spot there but when I blinked and looked it disappeared. I still didn't really think anything of it until a few days ago when I started seeing flickering rings of light at the edge of my vision when I turned my head or moved my eyes. I called my healthcare center in the morning the day after and they told me to go check it out immediately, so I did.

I told the emergency room nurses and doctor that I took 70 mg elvanse for my ADHD right away and also mentioned I hadn't gotten a lot of sleep for a few days. The doctor literally told me I ""seemed doped up"" and proceeded to angrily berate me for taking a too high dosage of elvanse even though I was just following my doctor's prescription (I can kind of understand the doped up comment tbh, I'm pretty sure I give off pepe silvia vibes whenever I try to explain anything even when I'm not sleep deprived and running exclusively on caffeine and stimulants). To her credit she backed off a lot when I got upset and actually took me seriously enough to order a CT scan and an eye exam right away after that. I'm really grateful for that, but I'm kind of pissed that she acted like it was my fault my dosage was off. I would love to have more regular consultations about my meds and dosage and easier access to medical help with my ADHD but unfortunately our healthcare system is garbage so that's not how it works.

I've heard about other people being treated crappy by healthcare workers bc of their ADHD meds but this was a first for me.

**TLDR**; Had visual hallucinations, got told to seek medical help immediately, ER doctor told me I ""seemed doped up"" and angrily berated me for taking a too high dosage despite just following my doctor's prescription.

**EDIT** this post kind of blew up while I was playing dnd yesterday(anyone wanna talk about curse of strahd?) and I haven't been able to keep up with the comments! I'm so thankful for all the love and support you're all giving me and other people in the community, thank you so much!<3

I've tried answering comments as best I can but I want to clear up some of the most asked questions and comments!

1. Luckily my CT scan and eye exam both came out looking normal so they concluded it's probably an ocular migraine caused by stress, they just wanted to rule out something more serious like a detached retina or a brain tumor. I'll probably get beta blockers for a while to treat it so hopefully that's the end of it!
2. I started having these hallucinations long before I even started taking elvanse, the doctor just attributed the increased intensity to a change in my dosage at first, but they didn't completely coincide so they weren't sure. I have a scheduled meeting with my doctor next week and will discuss my dosage with her then! Most likely stress is the main factor, I've had a really stressful few months, but since I actually have a lot of free time this summer I'll hopefully be able to rest a bit.
3. I don't think sleep deprivation plays a huge part in my problem, I usually sleep pretty alright with my meds and I still have the migraines. It probably doesn't help but it's not the main cause. I wasn't having the migraines/hallucinations while I was in the ER either which I told them several times
4. Several people commented that mixing caffeine and stimulants isn't great and I agree, I'm definitely not as cautious as I could and should be. None of my doctors warned me about mixing elvanse with pretty much anything so I had a pretty lax approach to it from the start and that mindset has stayed with me. It's stupid I know, but I don't think I'm taking any huge risks, I drink coffee with it and occasionally alcohol but I'd never mix it with anything else.
5. I am extremely far sighted(+9 strength glasses hell yeah) so my shitty eyesight puts a lot of strain on my eyes too. I need new glasses but they're really expensive so atm I'm making do with my contacts that are slightly better, but I feel like this is probably my sign that it's time to actually get new glasses.
6. Oh, and I didn't put my meds up my ass, I'm just bad at prepositions lmfao

5,"RANT - Why do a 5 min task now, when you can f#ck yourself over mentally for several months till you eventually do it?","It's so exhausting, annoying and just stupid, but I do it all the time. E.g. I'd have to write a simple E-Mail for I think it's already several months now, and because it's important (but not really urgent), I have it always in the back of my head and stress myself out over it. But I just don't do it. And it's completely illogical. I'm aware that it basically takes zero effort to write this E-Mail, and that there are only benefits for doing it while there would be no downsides. 

If it was only one task it might not be so bad, but having idk how many tasks on several to-do lists to worry about just constantly stresses me out, while I'm not doing anything to change that. It feels like my mind is a prisoner in a body not always willing to cooperate. 

And the funny/sad thing is that if a friend would postpone such a task all the time, I'd kick his a$$ (in a friendly way) and watch him do it right then and there.

Yet patients, caregivers and clinicians sometimes find that a person's apparent ADHD doesn't fit neatly into the manual's definition.

7,"I feel like, compared to other people, I fundamentally lack the intuitive sense of how small increments accrue over time","If you ask me why I'm late all the time or why I put off my work or why I buy stuff I don't need or why I leave my room a mess, I think the most prominent thread connecting these tendencies is my brain's seeming inability to account for small losses and gains leading to substantial losses and gains. I can intellectualize it, I can write it all down on a spreadsheet or whatever, I can experience it over and over again, but I can never seem to feel nor believe on a gut level that the little things add up.

8,I'm so fucking sick of having ADHD," I‚Äôm sick of working twice as hard and getting half as far, 

I‚Äôm sick of forgetting everything I learn, 

I‚Äôm sick of the constant exhausting mental monologue I can‚Äôt shut up,

I‚Äôm sick of battling myself, 

I‚Äôm sick of having the logical maturity of a 24 year old but the emotional maturity of a toddler,  

I‚Äôm sick of drowning in emotions, 

I‚Äôm sick of repressing those emotions cause I never learned how to handle them, 

I'm sick of my anger and my sadness and my boredom and my desperation,

I‚Äôm sick of feeling like my mind doesn‚Äôt belong to me, 

I feel like the tiny part of my mind I still feel is ‚Äúme‚Äù just has to work full time as a prison guard keeping the rest of me in check, 

I'm sick of being fucked over by the healthcare system over and over again,

I'm sick of their stupid empty words they put up like a movie set facade to keep people from seeing the chaos and neglect happening behind,

I'm sick of just being a statistic to them while my life and wellbeing depends on them and will for the rest of my life,

I'm sick of disappointing others,

I'm sick of disappointing myself,

That's the worst part I think, that at the end of the day my life and my actions are still my responsibility and blaming ADHD won't change that. My emotions are mine, my actions are mine, my failures are mine, I can't separate myself from them no matter how much I hate them. I'm so fucking sick of having ADHD. Controlling my chaotic emotions and living every day with a mind that refuses to cooperate is wearing me down to a fucking shell of a human being. 

My meds help but they don't take away the bad, they just make me a little bit stronger against it but I'm so exhausted of keeping it under control and feeling like there's always a huge flood of anger, bitterness, spite, sadness and self hatred dammed up inside my brain that I can't ever lose control of and I can't get rid of even if I want to.

10,"Just because others have it worse, doesn't mean your ADHD is not an issue","Just putting this out here.

This Subreddit has helped me a lot. It made me actually realize that my ADHD was not just an issue while studying for University, but has impacted my whole life. I just never noticed it because everything seemed normal to me.

Accepting this has changed my life.

That being said, reading many posts here make me realize that, in many ways, my ADHD is rather tame compared to what others experience. And yes, this is also a bit of an Imposter Syndrome trigger for me.

So for those of you who need to hear it:

**Your ADHD being milder than that of others doesn't invalidate your experience. It can still suck for you.**

13,When people think you're slow because you're seeing the puzzle of a situation come together in your head yet have the audacity to lecture you when they finally see the picture you pieced together an entire hour earlier.,"A couple officemates were trying to sort through a problem at work earlier. I was watching their process and realized that they were going about it all wrong. I noticed that materials that would be relevant towards the end of the process referenced materials that were relevant only at the very beginning. Worse, the materials at the end wouldn't make sense unless they were read in connection with the earlier materials because they involved a series of piece meal amendments.

I suggested an alternative course of action and proposed that we organize by concept first and group co-dependent materials before arranging the concepts in the appropriate flow. They brushed the idea off because they thought my way would just complicate things since all we had to do was arrange chronologically.

Granted, I am not an organized person nor am I responsible or conscientious. There are a lot of things I wouldn't trust myself with.

What I am though is perceptive, perhaps to a fault. Maybe from a lifetime of having every little thing catch my attention, I've somehow developed an innate feel for seeing what pieces stick out or fit together. 

But holy fuck. I absolutely hate it when people assume that because I don't approach things in an ""organized"" manner, there's no way I could know what I'm talking about. 

In the end, the dumb fucks realized that their entire process was redundant. And because they insisted on ""simplifying"" their approach, they ended up having to backtrack and undo their work to make sense of what came later down the line, which could've been avoided if they followed my suggestion. 

But the dumb fucks don't even know that they're dumb. They actually thought that they came up with my idea on their own. And they had the audacity to lecture me to say, ""see if you didn't go through the process, you wouldn't have seen the problem. You can't take shortcuts.""

Except I literally did exactly that. I fucking did 'see the problem' you fucks and I got it from every ounce of my instinct screaming that something was about to go wrong because I've fucked up so much in my life that I can see it coming from a mile away. 

My apologies for the rant. It's been a rough week.

-----

EDIT: I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who's shared their experiences in the comments. Posted this after a rough day just wanting to let some steam out and woke up feeling a little less alone in the world thanks to you all. 

Just want to say though, I regret calling my officemates  ""dumb fucks."" They aren't lol. And they have been cool and helpful in the past. It was a snap reaction that I feel came from a mixed bag of feelings. But I do regret the toxicity. 

Last thing I want to say, I noticed some comments that bordered on hating on NTs or linear thinkers and I worry about maybe sparking something negative. 

I get it though. It sucks living in a world that can often feel like it was designed to work against us (and in many ways actually has been). It sucks that we always seem to be the ones forced to adjust to the ""norm"" that's been set by people who just function differently. But I do still think we can afford to hold ourselves to a kinder standard. 

Fuck the system. Be kind to the people trapped in it. And hopefully enough people respond with kindness in turn that the system can go fuck itself maybe.

18,"Please, let's stop the ADHD fetishization on TikTok and Twitter.","I feel a little... undermined, when I see that apparently everyone on the internet has ADHD. This is NOT me gatekeeping ADHD, I'm not even the type who says you NEED a diagnosis either, that's a completely different discussion. What I'm talking about is all the tweets im seeing about how we all have ADHD it's just going misdiagnosed, and TikTok's ""put a finger down ADHD edition"" which are like: put a finger down if you: have trouble sleeping, forget to do your homework, your room is untidy etc. then that must mean you have ADHD!

I feel like I'm going insane because, where was this feeling of everyone having ADHD when I was undiagnosed and about to fail school? Everyone I have known has had problems with keeping tidy or remembering to do assignments, that's not ADHD! ADHD CAN be those things, but it's usually the norm, not the exception. It usually becomes such a big deal that you feel like you're unable to function properly.

I'm not trying to be the gatekeeper here I promise, I just think we need to be a little more responsible in our messaging. The reason I'm upset is not because more people are getting diagnosed, that's awesome! I'm getting upset because I fear like this is only going to lead to more people seeing ADHD as a ""quirky"" diagnosis which isn't actually a big deal because ""everyone deals with these problems."" Please, it's not like that.

\--

EDIT: Okay 2.2k upvotes later and I need to clarify something because my message feels like it's being lost, and that's okay we can talk about this and discuss it. 

I didn't know it would get this much attraction, I was just expecting to post this and get a few positive comments and move on. I'm conflicted because while it's helped a lot of people, I also feel like people are taking away the wrong message, so I don't want to take it down, I just want to explain and clarify some things:

There is NOTHING wrong with consuming ADHD TikTok, if that helped you get your diagnosis you go girl!!! I am really happy for you and I'm glad it helped. 

My main message was this: My whole life I have heard nothing but ""everyone deals with this"", ""you just need to stop being lazy"", ""you need to just work harder."" Over and over and over again. My parents specifically didn't get me a diagnosis because ""Oh they're just a child!!!"" This rheteroic has for the most part gone away and I couldn't be more grateful! My only issue is that it feels like the rhetoric has shifted, but the message has stayed. It's the exact same stigma and the exact same argument, but it's no longer negative it's positive. It's almost like ""oh yeah you're just lazy for sure, but that's because you have ADHD!!!"" and it's like, wait- no- that's not what I was trying to say at all. The problem wasn't really that you were saying that ADHD is a bad thing, because it is. The problem is that you were conflating ADHD with symptoms you deal with, but they aren't the same. But that same reasoning has stayed, but the spin has turned negative to positive. 

Does that make sense? I hope I'm not rambling. A lot of the discussion has turned on people who are trying to seek attention or seem special and I'm really not even concerned about that, let people do what they want if it makes them happy. Just, let's shoot for a more accurate discussion about ADHD, and shoot down misinformation? That's all I was saying x

20,How to get off your phone and get out of bed,"I can't promise that you won't get back on your phone lol, but this is what I find myself doing unintentionally when I'm fed up with myself,  and so I've started doing it deliberately.


There's a moment that everyone reaches where they think, ""I want to get off of my phone"". For people with ADHD that thought can arrive a lot later than,  ""I should probably get off of my phone"", because you end up getting stuck dopamine-fishing.

As soon as you start to feel the slightest bit of desire or need to get off of your phone:


- Close your eyes. 

That's it. Just close them. Being on your phone is such a visual stimulus. Get rid of the visuals. It's just you and your thoughts. If there's audio playing on your device, you're on hard-mode, but you can still do it,  I believe in you. 



- While your eyes are closed, turn off your phone screen. You dont have to power the phone all the way off, although that helps- you just have to turn the screen off. 


My next step is to usually chuck my phone across the room because I have full faith in my otterbox, but I mean, you can hold onto it if you want. 


The most important part is the next step:



- Focus on standing up. 

This is difficult because your attention is competing with whatever you were just doing on your phone,  and you're going to feel tempted to resume your phone activities. This is why it helps if you can power your phone off with your eyes closed. Your eyes should still be closed. 


Silence the noise in your brain by counting to 10 and thinking about both of your feet being on the ground.  Think about being an individual that's standing up. It may seem silly to break down getting up like this, but the idea is to break away from the magnet that is your bed/ chair/comfort area. 


Tbh sometimes I just slump onto the floor like a worm, which works sometimes, but sometimes I just end up laying on the floor for another 40 minutes. That's why it's important to think about being standing,  and not just ""out of bed"". If I'm not careful, I end up in another location, stuck in the same rut. 



- Bonus step:


Once you're standing, repeat a mantra of what you want to be doing,  followed by ""it's easy"".
For example,  ""I'm gonna take the clothes out of the dryer, it's pretty easy"". You're pigeon-holing your focus onto one task,  and your reminding yourself that what you want to do is doable, and that you're capable. 

If you're in an internal battle of which task you want to do, just go with whatever is the first **relevant** one that you blurt of your mouth. No need to consider any further than that.",of7rsf,3089,1.0,250,2021-07-07 00:25:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/of7rsf/how_to_get_off_your_phone_and_get_out_of_bed/,False,False,2021,7

27,Telling people that I have been diagnosed with a physical illness vs ADHD,"It is infuriating how much more sympathy I get for having just been diagnosed with fibromyalgia vs ADHD!!!!!!!!

I cried when I was diagnosed with ADHD. Life unmedicated was so hard and I didn‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôd zone out, not be able to finish a course, not be able to complete a load of laundry, lose all my shit(I still do). Get constant criticisms that made me feel so stupid and terrible. Get called lazy. I failed college my first go and I‚Äôm trying so hard to fix my fuck ups.

My ADHD diagnosis hit me way harder and I sobbed. I sobbed to my sister whose always been so critical of my inability to function and she basically told me I was too sensitive(another blow to my ADHD).

But my fibromyalgia diagnosis? My sister teared up. She told me I‚Äôve had the symptoms since my bio mom died when I was 14 and she felt bad she never took my symptoms seriously(meanwhile I was failing high school bc of ADHD). My father blames himself(he has ADHD that he refuses to get diagnosed). People give me so much sympathy for the physical illness and many people are just shocked because I‚Äôm young. 

I‚Äôm just so frustrated. Like I can‚Äôt even get out of bed without my adderall. I can‚Äôt maintain my home without my Wellbutrin and adderall. Can‚Äôt manage my classes, remember appts, concentrate at work. And while lately fibromyalgia has disabled me in some ways, by and large I‚Äôve worked through being in constant pain and living with it because it‚Äôs all I have known. 

But lacking executive function?!?!! FOR FUCKING GET IT. I‚Äôm sorry but lacking the ability to use my brain is just as debilitating. They‚Äôre both serious and should be treated as such. I hate the invalidation I constantly get for my mental illness diagnoses.

0,How I cured my adhd permanently,"I've been suffering from adhd my whole life, for about 26 years now.

""Just use a planner""

I was shocked when he said this, and my adhd went away as soon as he finished that sentence. I started focusing like crazy. Guys try this out.

5,PSA - there are almost 1.25 million people in this sub,"I've been here for a while and have noticed that many of the posts here are a version of DAE - ""does anyone else...""

These posts are usually met with a chorus of replies exclaiming that they too relate to what the OP is describing. This may lead the participants and other readers to conclude that such experiences are intrinsic to ADHD. 

They're often not. There are almost 1.25 million subscribers to this sub-reddit. Ten, twenty, or even one hundred people here affirming your experience does not mean that the experience is symptomatic of your shared condition. If you receive 1,250 unique responses to your post, that means 1/1000th or 0.1% of the community identifies with what you've conveyed. Of course many of these million are lurkers.

People with ADHD are diverse. Out of 1.25 million people with the condition, you will get an intersection of many other conditions, identities, personalities, etc. Because of its sheer volume, there will be thousands of people in this sub that relate to any post, many of whom would regardless of if they had ADHD or not. If you ask ""DAE do X thing"" and X thing happens to be typical of Y condition, you are going to receive many responses from the thousands of people with Y condition that also happen to have ADHD.

It's great to post about all sorts of things affecting our lives - it's a sub for people with ADHD not just about it. I'm only suggesting that we be wary of confirmation bias before attributing any relatable experience to our condition.

6,I caught my girlfriend actually give a f..,"I was just looking for a song to play through her phone.. and that‚Äôs when I saw it... her spotify homepage was filled with ADHD-related content. I asked her about it and she responded that she just ‚Äúreally wanted to understand me better‚Äù. She asked if I was insulted. Of course I wasn‚Äôt!! It was the most thoughtful thing an SO had ever done for me. 

As most of you can probably imagine, I‚Äôm quite used to people being bothered by my ADHD-related traits. I feel like that is the main reason people dont want to invest in me and leave/neglect the relationship. They don‚Äôt (care to?) understand its groundworks and implications. I cant blame them, I dont even really do that myself.. I just live it..

But her? She doesnt just brush off my ADHD-traits as a nuisance which she ‚Äòhas to deal with‚Äô. She‚Äôs fascinated by it; she wants to understand. On top of that, she, herself, is extremely structured and organised, which makes it even more special that she doesnt think any less of me for my ADHD. There‚Äôs not the slightest hint of any ‚Äúhow hard can it be‚Äù-stances. It seems she truly loves me regardless. 

I dont have to hide or be ashamed of anything ADHD in this relationship. And it brings me so much closer to accepting and being okay with my ‚Äòflaws‚Äô.

8,Something my therapist called me out on that I think might help some of y'all,"I was talking to my therapist this week about my ADHD and why I find it hard to ask for help. I've always *needed* help to get started on most projects, and then momentum keeps me going. Or sometimes I need help to calm down when overloaded, or angry, or emotional dysregulation's getting at me.

Mid conversation he paused and said to me: ""Let me know if I'm off base here, but **do you get a sense of pride when you pass as neurotypical?**""

That's something I've never really thought of before. There a difference between trying to fit into a system made for neurotypicals and trying to pass as one myself. I struggle with both; however, the second leads to it being hard to accept myself for who I am. 

I have ADHD, and no amount of ""passing"" will change that... so why do I keep trying to pretend I don't have it? Why do I make things needlessly difficult for myself by never asking for accommodations, or just help in general?

Anyways, I figured that there'd be some other out here with the same issue. **Stop trying to pass as neurotypical. You aren't and that's okay.**",p3nh83,3796,0.99,293,2021-08-13 15:39:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/p3nh83/something_my_therapist_called_me_out_on_that_i/,False,False,2021,8

11,"Most people think ADHD is ""SQUIRREL!"" what it is actually is me showing up to the gym in a gaudy pink and green cat themed tank top impulsed purchased last year because all my workout clothes are dirty and piled in the laundry basket. Also wearing dress shoes cause I forgot to switch.","
Why is this in ""success"" do you ask? Well because in order for all my athletic wear to be dirty it means I've been consistently making time for working out instead of getting distracted by my phone or whatever else I do that somehow taken away from my available time to work out (I truly don't know where most of my hours go). Also, because I used this horrific hideous tank top I wasted money on for the first time in over a year. Impulse purchases are always gonna happen for me. My medication makes it better but it is inevitable but I see actually getting some use out of it as a net positive. And the biggest success is even though I was wearing horribly inappropriate shoes to work out, I didn't turn around go home and give up. I did what excercises I could without destroying my feet (mostly upper body weight lifting) and then afterwords came home switched into my sneakers and went for a run around town for a little bit. 



I think why I'm so happy is that my life is objectively still not ""together"" but this is a win on so many levels for my ADHD brain. A lot of people I know would look at this as me messing up and not being the best I could be. I see this as progress and me being better than I've been.

I felt bad today as I know I'm not as goofy when I'm on my meds (I tend to be more serious, better at emotionally processing & not avoiding conflict, which is how I feel in moments when I'm not making and unmedicated).

I just want to clarify that the cop didn't do anything wrong he just looked at my ID and let me explain my situation and after doing that he let me go home saying that it's clear that i went to the doctor in good faith

First of all, I'd like to thank everyone that commented and messaged in my first post. 

This post got more attention than I ever thought it would, so I just thought I would share everything that has happened since and use this to check in on everyone that said that they would book their medical appointments to make sure that they actually did.

For those who are curious, I was diagnosed with Lymphoma, a very treatable type of cancer. I consider myself extremely lucky as I probably would be dead by now had I have waited this long with any other type of cancer.

A week after my diagnosis I quit my job and moved back to the UK where I am entitled to free healthcare. God bless the NHS. 

Since July I have been undergoing chemotherapy and yesterday, halfway through my treatment, I found out that I am in REMISSION!

Treatment has been pretty rough but overall, I'd say that it's better than the alternative!

A lot of people asked me what my symptoms where before being diagnosed. I had quite a few non-specific symptoms which I brushed off as something else as I didn't think they were linked:
-swollen lymph nodes
-itchy skin (legs and hands)
-brain fog
-intolerance to alcohol

However there are many other symptoms that can be more telling, such as night sweats.

Once again, please use this as a reminder to check in with your health and book that medical appointment you have been avoiding doing.

1,"I hired a nanny for myself because ADHD is a disability and I deserve help. You do, too.","(Paragraphs are titled because everyone reading this has ADHD lol)

## Me personally:

I'm 28, I have a career, I build furniture for fun, and I somehow can't [insert every basic household chore here]. I desperately want to, but those kind of foundation-level tasks just make my brain explode, hello ADHD. So you know what I did? It was nowhere near easy, but I hired a nanny. For myself. Just this past month. And it's fucking amazing.

The more I learned about my ADHD, the more I've come to terms with the fact that I _am not lazy,_ I have a goddamn mental disorder! This is a DISABILITY so why the hell are we all pretending it's our fault??

## Validating my choice, societal scale:

I did some hard thinking on ~society~ and realized that the whole reason humans thrive is because we chip in with the things we're good at and get help from others who have the skills we lack. That's why there's the sales department and the engineering department, no one would expect those people to be interchangeable. You've got the baker and the blacksmith, both relying on each other and no one bats an eye at that. (In the US at least) we have this poisonous and completely false emphasis on individuality and independence that just a flat out lie. Nobody actually lives like that.

## ...and then personal scale:

So bringing it back: I'm not bad at doing chores, per se, but it takes me an absurd amount of energy to do what others can do easily, so I thought, why am I killing myself like this? I know my problems stem from ADHD which I can only control so much, and I've tried everything I could possibly think of to make it easier, so why am I counting this as a failure? Why should I even NEED to be fully independent on these things when someone else could and would help me? 

## So I did it!!!

I had to wrangle my ingrained humiliation, but I went online and hired someone with the understanding that I have insurmountable problems (don't downplay yourself, it's just the truth) and need assistance to thrive (as all humans do with all sorts of different things). 

If you can afford $30/week to have somebody nice to come over twice a week for an hour and help you catch up on chores, I can tell you it is absolutely life changing. Simply having that safety net has even made me able to handle some of the things I previously couldn't, all on my own!! My depression is even on vacation! 

# HOW I did it (in detail ‚Äî bolded important parts)

I tried several methods that didn't pan out, until **my therapist recommended care.com.** It has a fee but it was worth it, because they have such a wide user base and the people are legitimately good. 

There is basically no acknowledgment (in general) that adults with ADHD even deserve this kind of help (and therefore no category for it) so I chose the closest and **I put an ad in the Nanny category, and this was effective!** (Elderly Care was runner-up) This worked because most people interested in being a nanny just genuinely want to help make someone's life easier. Some people also just really love kids, so I read people's bios to judge who would be sympathetic and would really enjoy helping me. 

**I was super clear in my ad that I'm an adult and I need help looking after my home life** and details of precisely what kind of help I was looking for so there were no misunderstandings. ([Here's what I wrote](https://imgur.com/a/z9617bf)) I felt super vulnerable and scared and I actually asked a close friend if they would help me answer messages, but I ended up being able to do it on my own. After a few days I got a lot of hits and also reached out to people who had the magic combo of Nanny, Housekeeping, and Special Needs as their fields.

**People were unbelievably nice!** One girl even messaged me to say that she did not have any availability but she was proud of me and wished me the best and I'm crying right now LMAO

**Anyway it worked!!!!!** This awesome lady comes over to my apartment twice a week now (she's a mom and has two autistic sons, so she GETS IT). She just helps me do all my chores and anything that I've been having a hard time with. 

## What she does for me:

She comes twice a week: 

1. First, she does my dishes because that is the hardest thing for me. She just walks in, over to the sink, and immediately grabs the sponge <3

2. I make a list of what I have been putting off for the past few days, and we work together!

3. She does the things that are giving me the most stress, and I do whatever I feel comfortable with. (She has assured me that she wouldn't mind doing everything, but I want to help and her presence unlocks my paralysis.)

4. She's super nice and straightforward and we enjoy each other's company, which is a plus!


Anyway, I'm sharing this journey because every single person with ADHD deserves someone to help them. ADHD is a disability and that isn't shameful. I know how hard it is to find help when everyone tells you you shouldn't need it, so I hope this can help somebody!

_Edit: I've added a pic of [the job posting I wrote](https://imgur.com/a/z9617bf)_

_Edit 2: Regarding price! Many people have pointed out that $30/week seems super low._ This is because the person I've hired is **not** working for me as a nanny or a housekeeper. The workload is much lighter than a nanny, and the focus of the work is very different than a housekeeper. Housekeepers help the home, but the person I hired helps _me_ help the home.

She also doesn't rely on this for income. I've found that there are a lot of people out there in the same position. For instance, I've found that some are stay-at-home moms who legitimately like this stuff and just want to help somebody and get out of the house for a couple hours a week. (Also, I told her to name her price and she asked for less than I ended up giving her, so ü§∑)

For reference, my average regional prices:

- Housekeeper ‚Äî $120/visit
- Nanny ‚Äî $25-35/hr
- Minimum wage ‚Äî $9.70/hr",prnfcm,6308,0.98,830,2021-09-20 04:15:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/prnfcm/i_hired_a_nanny_for_myself_because_adhd_is_a/,False,False,2021,9
2,I read a meme about how people will take you seriously if you say that you have a neurological condition that (symptom) but as soon as you mention it‚Äôs ADHD their demeanor changes. It‚Äôs true. You could literally be like‚Ä¶,"*inhale*

‚ÄúI have a neurodevelopmental condition that affects my brains ability to do executive functioning, which basically means that things like planning, organization, impulse control, task initiation, short-term memory, sustained focus, self-motivation and time management are more difficult for me which can affect my daily life, which requires these skills. My prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for a lot of this and higher functions is likely smaller than average and would likely show less activity on a brain scan. People with this disorder typically have brains that are 3 years behind in development in relation to their peers in certain aspects. 

 A big component to this disorder is dysregulation of the central nervous system and has even been found to be frequently comorbid with other disorders such as sleep disorders which can compound on this. Though we don‚Äôt know exactly what is going on in every case I likely have lower-than-normal levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, responsible for many many functions, including the ones affected by this condition. Possibly serotonin and/or norepinephrine as well.

 A large impairment is inability to REGULATE ones focus. It‚Äôs not so much about complete lack per say that someone with this can focus sometimes but has difficulty choosing when or for what. They may try to start a task only to quickly get distracted on something else completely irrelevant, and may end up focusing on that instead. I can focus for a long time sometimes on something that is interesting but not so important, but when I need to sit down and do something unstimulating, say, paperwork, a combination of poor impulse control, racing thoughts, low frustration tolerance and high distractability means that I might struggle more significantly than the average person who might not like doing it, but can just buckle down and ‚Äúget er‚Äô done‚Äù when needed. Sometimes it is the opposite, where I focus too much to the point of not being able to stop/redirect it, despite it being more convenient to do so. Some may also hop from task to task as they have new thoughts to distract them on to something else, forgetting what they were originally doing. This is no more controllable than a person with OCD controls their compulsions, although there are strategies to help cope and work around ones deficits in order to succeed. 

Not exclusive but common to this disorder is dysregulation of emotions as well. This is not as well known, but when I am angry, I RAGE, when I am sad, my entire world crashes down around me. When I am happy, I am EXCITED and BURSTING WITH ENERGY. The emotional roller coaster in itself is exhausting, and for those that especially struggle with the poor impulse control aspect, it can get them in trouble. 

Speaking of that, it is estimated that nearly a quarter of the prison population has this disorder, despite it only effecting about 4% of the general population. That‚Äôs a huge difference. That‚Äôs not to say that having this MAKES one a criminal: we all choose our path in life. But some of the traits associated with it: impulsivity and hyperactivity, increased risk-taking  (mixed in with the wrong environment and bad influences/choices) can certainly make things worse, and predispose the wrong (or right I guess) person to that kind of lifestyle. 

Having this disorder also can predispose you to having substance use or abuse issues. People with this are hugely overrepresented among addicts, with this disorder being 5 to 10 times more prevalent amongst alcoholics than the general population. Poor impulse control and higher risk-taking/novelty-seeking behaviour, can contribute, as well ‚Äúself-medication‚Äù to try to deal with the symptoms of this disorder. Many claim that their drink or puff or what-have-you will ‚Äúslow them down‚Äù enough to be able to focus, although clearly this maladaptive coping strategy comes with many consequences, and the actual vs. perceived benefit seems‚Ä¶ questionable. Also common is binge eating, smoking, excessive caffeine intake (caffeine and nicotine are stimulants, albeit mild ones that have shown some benefit for treating the symptoms of this disorder) and impulse shopping/difficulty with managing finances. 

People with this disorder are nearly twice to three times as likely to get into a vehicle accident than people without. 

This disorder is highly comorbid or a common cause of secondary anxiety and/or depression. Struggling with this untreated can make the person depressed because they feel that no matter how hard they try, they are still having more difficulty than the people around them, and may not be doing as well at school or work as they want to, which causes a huge blow to the self-esteem. They may blurt things out in conversations or have struggles socializing, (though not nearly to the degree or in the same ways as autism) sometimes seeming ‚Äúweird‚Äù to others, which can lead to judgement and social rejection, hurting their self-esteem and confidence further. They may begin to see themselves as stupid, lazy, or crazy. Children growing up with this condition are estimated to receive about 20,000 more negative messages from others, due to the symptoms they display which may be misunderstood by others, by age 10. Many adults with the disorder report feeling like they are dissatisfied and lost in life and unable to utilize their full potential. Once the main cause (the primary disorder) is treated, the ‚Äúdepression‚Äù tends to go away. It can also cause anxiety due to constant worrying of what they might forget next, due to the short term memory issues, or how they might mess up, especially if they have been heavily criticized in the past for their symptoms, which can be seen as ‚Äúlaziness‚Äù or ‚Äúlack of discipline‚Äù by the general population. Many report having what could be described as a whirlwind of racing thoughts that never seem to stop and make it incredibly hard to concentrate. Anxiety can also be used as a (poor, if I do say so myself) coping mechanism, as the rush of adrenaline and cortisol associated with (say) being about to miss a deadline may be able to temporarily compensate for the lack of dopamine that is thought to impede their ability to focus. Basically sending them into fight or flight just so they panic and complete the task. This is how some people with the disorder learn to function: by being stressed all the time, or even OVERLY organized and neurotic in an OCD-like way in order to overcompensate and try to stay on top of their symptoms and calm the mess in their head. (Though certainly a lot don‚Äôt or would struggle too much to even develop this way of coping in particular) 

Wait! But there‚Äôs good news. There‚Äôs a treatment that‚Äôs been studied for a long time, proven relatively safe for MOST healthy people at prescribed therapeutic dosages, has actually been proven to calm hyperactivity and/or racing thoughts, LOWER rates of addiction and substance misuse amongst the treated despite being a pill and is usually not addicting to those who actually need it and take it as directed, (the problem is remembering to take it lol) lowers the risk of driving accidents to about normal, increases dopamine levels and activity in the prefrontal cortex, allowing people with the disorder to function much more normally, decreases impulsivity and may even help with emotional regulation for some people. Can even calm anxiety IF the anxiety was stemming from their untreated disorder symptoms, despite being typically contraindicated for anxiety disorders.‚Äù

Or am just waste of the modern world. I'm useless, I can't focus in places where I should be able to, my hyperactivity and impulsivity is only a distraction for normal people and simple things make me wanna cry. Now I'm wasting your time too. And I shouldn't even feel this way. I have things like home, family and money. But instead of feeling good I feel ashamed. Literally nothing happened and I suddenly feel like my heart is gonna pop out. And my life is not even that stressful. I really hope this is just one of mood swings, because if this doesn't go away I don't really know what I'm gonna do.

4,"A lot of us before diagnosis believed we had a motivation problem, and thought we just need more motivation in order to force through. But after learning that I/we have a focus disability, I believe if any normal person had motivation equal to that of an ADHD person, they would conquer the world.","This might be different for people who are only hyperactive, I don't know how that affects you guys. (I'm primarily inattentive)

How many times have we set up schedules, device reminders/alarms, tried associating certain tasks to certain other tasks, locked apps/devices/distractions, etc., all just to accomplish normal things?  How many of us have started running/lifting/exercising just to get bored and not really do anything while there and to end up not going next time?  Then we try again, fail, try again, get frustrated, just to try again and fail later?  Eventually we get discouraged and quit for a while, just to get frustrated and try again later.

We don't lack motivation, not at all, we just lack control over our focus.  No normal person is like this.  They just...do things.  When they want to.  They might struggle sometimes, but never to this extent.  And because of that, they don't have _nearly_ as much motivation as _we_ do.  No one is more motivated than someone who feels like they _should_ be able to make it work _if only they could just try harder._

Imagine what we could have accomplished with all this motivation if we didn't have this disability.  Think of that goal you gave up on because you just couldn't get the hard stuff done.  Think of all the wasted time trying and failing at homework that could've been used in a different way if we were able to finish this stuff in time.

If we kept the motivation level and just gained a normal person's focus control, I think we'd all have accomplished incredible things.

9,"End of ADHD psychiatry session: ""Call my office to have them set up your next appointment."" You know I have ADHD, right? I will make that call in about 6 months.","This is partly a rant but also a success story that I hope will help others. Pre-diagnosis, found a psychiatrist because I suspected I have ADHD (mostly thanks to you fine people and your stories and support, thank you!).

I‚Äôd never worked with a psychiatrist before, but there were a few red flags:

- after asking questions about my past to diagnose me, he prescribed Ritalin because, ‚Äúif it helps, then you probably have ADHD‚Äù

- after it helped, I asked if he is diagnosing me with ADHD, and he replies, ‚Äúthe goal isn‚Äôt a diagnosis, it‚Äôs symptom management‚Äù. My insurance disagrees.

- 1 hr sessions ended in 15 minutes when he seemed to get board and abruptly ended the session saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll renew your prescription and you keep at it.‚Äù

- he ended the sessions with the quote from the title. He got upset when it took me 8 weeks to call and set up my 6 week follow up. I asked if I could just set up the next session now on the phone and he got annoyed and said, ‚Äújust call my office, please. And don‚Äôt wait this time.‚Äù

After two sessions I was done with him and found another psychiatrist. The new guy re-diagnosed me, gave a prescription with more informed starting dosage, and before my first session his assistant set up two sessions in advance so I wouldn‚Äôt have to schedule the follow up myself.

I know we don‚Äôt always have choice with healthcare, as we go where our referrals, insurance in-networks, and bank accounts allow us to go. But as far as possible, my advice is not to settle for a bad psychiatrist. If it doesn‚Äôt feel right, it isn‚Äôt right. There‚Äôs a good fit for you out there somewhere. Keep trying to find it.

11,"Was just denied going back on stimulants because ""adults only take stimulant ADHD medication for the euphoric high they provide, just like meth or other steet drugs"".","Pardon my French, but what a fucking whirlwind of an appointment I just had. 

My previous therapist left, so I was assigned a new one and this was my first appointment with him. He's a super nice guy, went to the same college I did, spent a lot of time in the town I now work in, so he's easy to connect with. Obviously a huge plus. 

We covered all of the usual stuff, diagnosed as an adult, how my childhood was, medications I've been on, what's worked, what hasn't, etc. We started talking about how I was put on Adderall, then taken off 6 months later because of blood pressure concerns, and he asked if that was a route I wanted to revisit. I told him that out of the medications I've been on, Adderall had the most positive affects, but I was open to anything. He told me he'd have to run it by his supervisor and we'd go from there.

He left and came back 10 minutes later, supervisor leading the way. She started the conversation off stating she agreed with my family doctor's decision to take me off Adderall. Fine. Understandable. Hypertension is a serious concern, I'm not about to argue that matter. The problem is, she never actually brought up blood pressure at all. She agreed with my doctor's decision, and went immediately into a spiel about how Adderall is a controlled substance for a reason, they virtually never prescribe Adderall or any other stimulant ADHD medication for adults, and adults typically only seek stimulant medications for the euphoric high that they provide, which is similar to meth or other street drugs. The entire time she stared me down with obvious accusation in her eyes.

So this is the same facility I've been going to in the past, the same one who was prescribing me, an adult, Adderall just earlier this year. The issue is, now that I've gotten my blood pressure taken care of and I'm curious about the possibility of going back on the medication THEY WERE GIVING ME, I'm clearly now a drug addict trying to score a controlled substance. So that feels great. Anyways, I'm going to try Wellbutrin and definitely find a new behavioral health facility, because being accused of that feels fucking terrible.

Thank you for all of your comments about past and current experiences with stimulants, and thank you for reassuring me there's actual help out there somewhere.

15,My new boyfriend has ADHD and I don't know how to handle his anger,"Hi - I have been dating a guy for about almost 8 weeks and things were going great. I noticed some things that were different about him that I have never encountered with anyone else, like he is super communicative and says exactly what is on his mind, sounds drive him crazy, he gets distracted and can sometimes seem disconnected. He also wants sex constantly and in absurd surroundings. I saw him have a meltdown at one of his family members over a non-stick pan not sticking, which I thought was a very over-the-top reaction for the situation.

Yesterday, he got angry for the first time at me. We were sitting eating dinner at a bar and he was in his own world talking about all kinds of things and I told him he was annoying me. All I really wanted was some attention. He clearly got extremely offended and when we left he drove his sport car like a maniac and blasted the music. When we got to his house, I left and went on a 20 min walk to see if that would de-escalate things. When I got back, he was extremely angry and started yelling. He is 245lb and was acting aggressive and i didn't know how to handle it, so I left. This morning, I texted him saying I read about emotional control in ADHD and I am sorry if leaving was not the way to handle it. I told him that I would be happy to work around the anger issues, but i would need to know how to handle it in the future. He is pretty much ignoring me and still upset. This wasn't a huge deal to me, but he is unusually upset and doesn't want to see me today. He's been attentive and sweet this whole time, but I have no idea what to do...

Thank you

&#x200B;

UPDATE: He texted me hours later telling me it was my behavior that was the problem. He said I had been distant the last few days and I shouldn't have walked away and left him there. He said he loved me and he hopes we could learn from this.

Because of all of your advice, I Googled ""abuser"" and he met almost every single piece of criteria. The possessiveness, the sexual abuse, etc. I was shocked. I never dreamed that was what this was. I thought I was totally in love with him.

Before I went to bed last night I texted him telling him that his behavior driving and afterwards was unacceptable and that I did not want to see him anymore. He responded in the middle of the night saying that he was glad because he was going to break up with me anyway and that I have anger issues! I am in disbelieve. Total shock.

I can't thank you all enough- I never even considered this to be abuse, but it makes total sense. You may have saved my life.

Notes: When I told him he was ""annoying me"" he had been difficult with the wait staff and was talking incessantly about nonsense. I said it very gently. Not in a mean way.

19,Trouble forming comprehensive sentences,"Does anyone else have this issue where when they are talking to someone in real time, it's nearly impossible to form a comprehensive sentence? It's stuff where like, if I'm typing it out I have all the time in the world to think my words out, but if I'm having a conversation then I can't wait forever to make a sentence, and I end up just spitting out garbage words in order to keep pace. For example, I'll just forget words and say ""put the thingy over there"", I'll forget the names of characters and say something like ""bird dude"" rather than take the time to remember what the character is actually called. If it's really bad  and absolutely no words are coming to mind my sentences will just come out as garbled jgjrblltplrpl like a toddler trying to talk. I'll just leave whole words out of my sentences ""Can you find the book for me--->find book"", or just switching words around where ""happy man"" will become ""mappy ham"". I sound like an idiot all the time, but I can't help it. Some people might think I'm doing some sort of skit, trying to sound cute and innocent, but in reality I'm struggling super hard and I just want to be able to hold a normal conversation. My mom says that my mind moves faster than my mouth does, and I think that's a pretty accurate way to describe how it feels. There's so much inside of me that I want to say that I end up not being able to say any of it. Has anyone else experienced this too?

2,Getting Help for ADHD Isn't Very ADHD-Friendly,"The process for individuals trying to find help for their ADHD is terrible, and frustrating and I wish it got more recognition.

So backstory, I've had ADHD my entire life it feels like. I got my first diagnosis when I was 7 years old, and have been on and off meds for years. That's been my own battle of deciding whether or not I chose to believe I had a disorder. I tried to get ahead of it in college, and got treatment about 8 years ago, but I haven't been on anything for about 7 years now. I've been just getting along with the coping mechanisms I've developed over the years, but now with the encouragement of my SO I decided to actually start making a real effort to treat it. I talked to my doctor about getting back on a medication, but she said she can't do that, I need to go see a psychiatrist.

That's cool, I don't mind seeing another doctor, but I've called THREE different psychiatry offices now, and first off nobody answers the phone. You just get a lengthy voicemail asking you to leave a message (which I do) and then they never call you back. That's the most ANNOYING shit I've run into so far is just how damn hard it is to actually find help. Not to mention, this has been a 3 month process now, because I have such a garbage memory, that 3 weeks will go by before I think about the fact that nobody has called be back. I'm starting to just feel completely helpless about the whole thing.  Like I end up feeling like ""I've managed to make it 32 years on this earth without really treating it, so why bother at this point."" My SO tells me I need to be persistent, and I know that I need to keep trying and keep seeking help, but it doesn't make it any less frustrating.

EDIT: Wow, I was just planning for this to be a shout into the void of the internet, but it sure blew up. Thank you guys for all the support, I will keep trying to get help.

EDIT 2: I'm trying to read everyone's comments, but this has been insane how much support and how cool it is hearing everyone's story and experiences. It gives me hope. I'm trying to read each one and reply to it, but with 400+ comments I know that's going to take a while. If I don't, then I just want to say thank you for sharing your story here.

5,I found out I don‚Äôt have ADHD ‚Äì I have Autism ‚Äì but I still really love this community,"I thought I had ADHD for years. It was a combination of focus issues at school, at work, and at home. I‚Äôm very inattentive, forgetful, and disorganized. I find it very hard to maintain relationships. I have struggled a lot with motivation and initiative. I look back at my life and categorize periods of time by my intense hyper-fixation at that time. All of that was a lot to deal with, but I handled it all the same. 

More recently, those things I was dealing with were having a much more significant impact on my work performance and my relationships with friends, family, and my partner. I finally thought it was time to pursue a diagnosis and treatment, so I didn‚Äôt lose my job or my partner. And this community gave me the confidence to actually call my doctor and ask for help instead of putting it off even more.

After a month of meeting with a psychiatrist, a therapist, and a very nice clinical psychologist for probably 15 hours total now ‚Äì I was diagnosed with severe Generalized Anxiety and Autism ‚Äì but definitely not ADHD based on some of the test results.

I understand my diagnosis, I know its probably right, a lot of what I am experiencing makes sense at the cross section of anxiety and autism ‚Äì I checked all the boxes. But I still feel a part of this community. I‚Äôm still going to struggle with attention, motivation, and initiation. I can still empathize with the struggle of others here. I can still celebrate the victories too. It‚Äôs just that my head is a little different than most other people here.

So, thank you everyone for the stories you shared and the discussion you had. I really appreciate what I was able to learn from yall and the confidence yall provided me.

I've been plagued with that my entire adult life and as someone who's been very recently diagnosed I'm coming to realize that a big part of my impulsivity is oversharing and not really being able to moderate my interactions as well as I should so at first meeting I come off as very interesting but after a while its overwhelming and off-putting.

15,"Not ADHD because ""I was able to complete all the questionnaires""","My pschiatrist sent me to a psychoneurologist to get assessed. He asked a few questions, had me do some tests on a computer (reaction time and processing visual and auditory input), and gave me three ADHD questionnaires to fill out, which I did.

At the end of the assessment, he said he didn't think I would be helped with another diagnosis (already got recurring depression and emotional instability), and that it would be better for me to narrow my focus to the depression rather than broadening it to include ADHD. As I had no problems with attention on the computer tests, he said medication would not be helpful for me. He wrote a letter to my psychiatrist with his assessment.

I questioned his assessment, but my psychiatrist said that a person with ADHD, after answering about five questions, would have been too inattentive and confused to understand the questions in the questionnaires or answer them correctly like I did. Therefore, I do not have ADHD.

Be that as it may (and I am willing to address the depression in therapy), is it okay for me to continue to post here occasionally? I know I have difficulties with executive function, regardless of the cause, and don't know another forum where they can be discussed in such detail and with the understanding found here.

Edit: Wow this blew up. But I also responded to a lot of people in here lol. You all are a fantastic community. I'm really glad people felt better from this post. Those of us with ADHD truly don't always get the support we need and sometimes giving it to ourselves is tough. The small things can really wear away at you and you don't even realize it. Hoping everyone here gives themselves the space to improve their own living situation for the benefit of themselves vs feeling pressured into it out of shame.",qj3ld1,2577,0.99,785,2021-10-30 15:18:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/qj3ld1/anyone_want_to_share_pics_of_their_place_no/,False,False,2021,10
0,I scared my boyfriend yesterday after I took my first dose of Adderall,"I got to take my first dose of Adderall (20 mg) yesterday evening. (I'm prescribed to take 2-20mg pills a day, but had to work during the day before I picked up my prescription.)

After about an hour after taking the pill, I got a blast of energy and then it eventually turned into  happiness and calmness. 

As soon as I felt relaxed -A feeling I've never felt before- I instantly started sobbing. My boyfriend looks over at me and saw me bawling my eyes out.  

In the middle of his game, he told his friends he had to go and started asking me what was wrong. He was scared that something bad happened. The exchange went something like this:

Him: Babe, what's wrong? 
Me: I'm happy.
Him: What?
Me: I'm so happy.
Him: Awww! As long as it's happy tears! 

He hugged me and I felt free.

I know that the exact feeling will eventually level out, but it was amazing and beautiful.

Edit:


thank you so much for the support and the awards. i never expected to get this much attention from my post!!!

hi, i appreciate all of the concern about my starting dosage. my doctor is the number one diagnostician in their state and easily read me like a book. all of the reviews rave about how their lives were changed. i fully trust my doctor. 

 I have ptsd, ocd, anxiety, depression, and pmdd on top of my adhd. it was really hard to function everyday and i just need pep in my step, which is why my dosage is higher than what people are used to. 

I also just started taking 25mg of zoloft this past monday, prescribed from a nurse practitioner on lemonaid health. my doctor immediately said that the dosage needs to be changed  to 50mg when i have my follow up on lemonaid health. of course i can't feel the difference yet since it takes a few weeks to start working/ seeing the affects. 

I know i'm in the honeymoon period, and wrote that i knew this feeling would level out. i'm not trying to mislead anyone!

I don't love getting messaged about how all i need to do is do deep breathing exercises to control my adhd. i grew up very active in a church where they didn't believe in mental health issues and adhd was ""a made up illness to control 6 year old boys that just needed the belt."" i tried to cope for 29 years without professional help. deep breathing exercises don't cure adhd.",qxftw8,6277,0.99,747,2021-11-19 13:06:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/qxftw8/i_scared_my_boyfriend_yesterday_after_i_took_my/,False,False,2021,11
1,Executive dysfunction is the worst part of ADHD,"You can be rational, intelligent and logical but there‚Äôs no ability to implement, and so a lot of your potential goes to waste, and you can‚Äôt do anything about it.

You know what you need to do in order to get better, but you can‚Äôt execute the things necessarily to achieve it. 

Doing daily tasks such as- doing the dishes, cleaning, cooking, reading‚Ä¶ all becomes incredibly difficult. 

And gosh‚Ä¶ actually planning and getting in reach with a psychiatrist to resolve this issue is a contradiction to the disorder itself.

2,What I thought ADHD was vs. what it's actually like for me,"People think ADHD looks like:

- Not paying attention in class

- Daydreaming

- Having too much energy

- Causing trouble

- Getting bad grades

- Procrastinating


But for me, it actually looks like:

- Talking too much/too quickly/too loudly

- Interrupting people

- Glazing over when others are speaking

- Unconsciously repeating weird sounds I hear (echolalia)

- Rattling off factual information that may or may not be of interest to others (infodumping)

- Losing my train of thought

- Doomscrolling

- Not being able to get motivated to start new tasks, even ones I am excited about (executive dysfunction)

- Finding monotony and tedium completely unbearable

- Fidgeting

- Only getting halfway through what I am doing before moving on to something else

- Terrible short-term memory

- Relying heavily on lists and spreadsheets to get anything done

- Being engrossed for hours/days/weeks when I find something interesting (hyperfocus)

- Constantly trying and abandoning new hobbies

- Always having songs stuck in my head

- Perpetually underestimating how long things will take

- Staying up past midnight and struggling to get out of bed in the morning (Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome)

- Missing appointments

- Running late

- Forgetting why I walked into a room (The Threshold Effect)

- Losing important items

- An online shopping addiction

- Caring way too much about what other people think of me (Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria)

- Drinking tons of caffeine

- Binge eating sugar

- Accidentally skipping meals because I don't realize I'm hungry

- Letting my food get cold because I forget that I am eating it, which I am literally doing at this exact moment

Edit to add one I left in the comments that a LOT of people in the particularly identified with:

- Writing and speaking in extremely long sentences with exceedingly complex sentence structure, generously peppered with () ; : and -- marks for flavor. If this is something you struggle with as well, the primary words I scan my text for are ""and,"" ""but,"" ""so,"" ""which,"" and ""thus."" When these words appear after a comma, they are frequently a good spot to swap out the comma for a period.


Also, while I'm editing this novel anyway, I have one more tip to add that can help others take you more seriously. Since you're already rereading what you wrote anyway, you might as well scan for this, too. I recommend reconsidering the word ""just"" in your sentences, particularly if you identify as a woman. ""Just"" is most frequently used to diminish the intensity of what you're saying. ""I was just wondering..."" ""I just thought..."" ""I just meant..."" It's insidiously deferential. (It's also subtly encouraged by a patriarchal society that genuinely feels that women are worth less than men and should be submissive to them.) If you change the above statements by removing the ""just,"" they immediately become more assertive: ""I was wondering..."" ""I thought..."" ""I meant..."" It doesn't substantially alter your meaning, but it significantly modifies your tone and immediately makes you appear more confident and worth taking seriously, which is how you low-key earn people's respect.

Obviously, there are still many other situations where the ""just"" is critical to the meaning of your statement. This is particularly true of ""just"" when referring to time, rather than personal actions. If I changed ""he just left"" to ""he left,"" it loses a significant portion of its meaning. Like I said, RECONSIDER ""just,"" not ""remove it from your vocabulary,"" because sometimes it's necessary. When you're editing your writing, think about each one and whether it's necessary. If not, leave it out.",qwdzqh,5780,0.99,965,2021-11-18 01:13:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/qwdzqh/what_i_thought_adhd_was_vs_what_its_actually_like/,False,False,2021,11
3,I spent over 500 days trying productivity apps so that you don't have to. Here are my results.,"Hello! So this is a really really long post. If you are like me and can‚Äôt read it all, that‚Äôs fine! Take it at your speed, and I included a quick summary at the end of each section and also at the end end. I also made subtitles and generally tried to keep it organized. Also, disclaimer that this is just my experience and you might love something I hated.

Okay, so let‚Äôs start by going through my methodology.

I tried a grand total of 36 (yep) apps and services, split into some broad categories. Routine-setting (i.e. to help with time blindness and doing things on time), to-do (for keeping lists), productivity (things that combine the two above), health and fitness (to be healthy), and habit building (to‚Ä¶ build habits). I tried each service for a minimum of 2 weeks, and eliminated any other systems I had that would interfere with features (for example when using to-do lists I deleted any other to-do list apps I had). This took me a grand total of 550 days (including some breaks). For the purposes of this, I did not factor in cost, and I also didn‚Äôt try every app I wanted to (honestly it‚Äôs tiring shifting your entire life over every 2 weeks). So, the structure I follow for these short reviews is a 1-2 sentence review, and a some criteria to help you decide whether it‚Äôs the right app for you. As for my review, I graded it against my personal deficiencies (I have time-blindness, love stats, task initiation problems, super easily overwhelmed, need rewards, can‚Äôt focus, pretty bad emotional dysregulation, etc). It should also be noted that I am a student and so evaluated it for my student life, so my ratings are not completely universal. It‚Äôs all good if you disagree!

Here goes:

**CATEGORY 1: ROUTINE SETTING**

***Tiimo:***

REVIEW: I thoroughly enjoyed using the app (actually continued using it past the 14 day trial period). While it was a bit buggy on android, all the other operating systems work. My biggest ‚Äúgood thing‚Äù about it is that the visual timer actually keeps me on task a quarter of the time (yes, it sounds stupid but that is monumental). Do keep in mind that you can‚Äôt reschedule or move anything, so this works best for people with rigid schedules

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You need reminders to start and also to stop
* You are a visual thinker who likes the timer wheel thingy
* Your daily/weekly/monthly schedule stays much the same

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You need to be able to move things around in your day super easily
* Icons/colours/personalization options just distract you
* You aren‚Äôt willing to spend a lot of time in set up

***Routinery:***

REVIEW: I also thoroughly enjoyed using this one - the interface was clean and nice and easy. The free version only includes 3 routines, which is not enough for many people. Even so, I found the fact that you could move tasks around so helpful.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* Your daily schedule is variable, you need flexibility
* You want to track the time things actually take you
* The pressure of a countdown timer keeps you motivated

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You get so hyperfocused that you don‚Äôt move forward for 7 hours
* You are a visual thinker for whom countdowns do not work
* You have many unmovable times for tasks

***Fabulous:***

REVIEW: Honestly, I disliked it. From the start I kinda felt that it was trying to shape my morning, and there were very few options for customization. However, the colours worked well together and would it have been more friendly for my schedule, I could definitely see myself using it.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You like pre-made routines
* Visual appeal of the app is important to you
* You need some help figuring out a healthy routine

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You already have a set routine
* You want a simple app
* You don‚Äôt want a storyline

***Habit Now:***

REVIEW: The platform was easy to set up, however, this app just didn‚Äôt meet my needs, especially in terms of time-blindness help and figuring out exactly what I needed to do right then. I would say it‚Äôs more of a habit app than a routine app.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You like tracking what you do
* Stats help you improve
* You like seeing the day at a glance

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You need reminders
* You find timeblocking most helpful
* You have a good amount of time blindness

***TimeTune:***

REVIEW: I liked the app, but it was a bit hard to figure out app of the different settings and exactly how to make a routine. As a serial procrastinator, I found it almost a bit too easy to just remove something altogether. Not quite for me.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You really like timeblocking
* You categorize your day
* You love widgets

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* Your tasks change times frequently
* Timeblocking just isn‚Äôt your vibe
* You need a visual countdown

***My Morning Routine:***

REVIEW: This was so easy and nice to figure out. I had completely made my routines in about an hour, and despite not really reminding me to get started (something I need), I was drawn to the clear UI of the app.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You want something super basic and easy to get the hang of
* You like the circular timer
* You can start your routines at any time

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You have a lot of set times
* You need an advanced tracker
* You have many flexible, movable tasks

***Brili:***

REVIEW: I found it extremely hard to cope with the font - It kept bothering me an unreasonable amount. That aside, it was helpful, but I got overwhelmed pretty easily seeing my day as a list. Apart from those two things, it was a very good app.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You like to move tasks around a lot
* You like having multiple views of your tasks
* You like getting trophies

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You feel overwhelmed seeing all your tasks in list form
* You need an aesthetic app
* The amount of icons will distract you

***BEST OF THIS CATEGORY: TIIMO AND ROUTINERY***

&#x200B;

**CATEGORY 2: TO-DO:**

***Todoist:***

REVIEW: It‚Äôs a basic to-do list app. Pretty smooth and easy. Dark mode is pleasant, lots of options to organize your to-dos.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You just need a list
* You like to tag, organize, and place subtasks
* You enjoy extensive text processing

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You need some kind of reward for checking off tasks
* The 1000 levels of prioritization and organization is overwhelming
* You want a ‚Äúfunner‚Äù to-do list

***Asana:***

REVIEW: While I liked Asana, I found it very confusing to both set up and actually use - however, the parts I could figure out were great.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You have a very complex and specific system
* You also want to see status/priority, etc
* You work with other people

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You want something simpler
* You want a reward for checking off tasks
* You get easily overwhlemed

***Water Do:***

REVIEW: This was one of my favourite apps - the UI was super clean and fun to use and I actually got disappointed when I ran out of things to do. I really enjoyed using this for the two weeks and plan to continue using it.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You want an aesthetic app
* You need a daily review
* You need a reward for finishing tasks

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You have a lot of tasks
* You need to be able to see all your tasks at once
* Your tasks have specific times

***To Round:***

REVIEW: Once again, I found myself getting disappointed when I ran out of things to do in my day - however the fact that there were no repeating tasks made it hard to navigate. Would they have repeating tasks, this app would be amazing.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You need a reward for completing tasks
* You like to set priorities
* Your tasks change daily

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You have a lot of repeating tasks
* You have a large amount of tasks
* You find the game-ified aspect too distracting

***Any.do:***

REVIEW: I enjoyed using Any.do, but it just didn‚Äôt give me the reward for finishing a task that I need to be productive.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You use iOS, android and browser
* You just need a list
* You have a simple system and workflow

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You have a more complex/specific workflow
* You work offline a lot
* You need a reward for finishing tasks

***Trello:***

REVIEW: I found the initial setup of trello hard, however beyond that it was easy and fun. It didn‚Äôt meet my need of having a reward though.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You have a specific workflow
* You are a visual person
* You work with other people

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You want a simple system
* You are easily overwhelmed
* You need a reward for completing a task

***TickTick:***

REVIEW: I liked using TickTick, but I got really overwhelmed looking at my tasks for the day, which made it a lot harder to stick to the system.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You want something easy to pick up on
* You like prioritizing tasks
* You need a calendar view

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You get easily overwhelmed
* You need a reward for finishing tasks
* You are easily overwhelmed

***Egenda:***

REVIEW: I really liked the simplicity of egenda, it was also super easy to figure out what I should be doing next/at all.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* Everything you do has a deadline
* You like categorizing
* You want something simple

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* Your tasks are flexible
* You need subtasks
* You need rewards for finishing tasks

***BEST OF THIS CATEGORY: WATER DO AND EGENDA***

&#x200B;

**CATEGORY 3: PRODUCTIVITY:**

***Focus To-Do:***

REVIEW: I liked Focus To-Do, though I found that I never actually used the tasks and to-do list options, and sometimes it glitched and reset all my pomodoros.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You want to integrate your task list with your pomodoros
* You need to be able to customize your pomodoro time
* You use many operating systems

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You want a simpler timer
* You find customization overwhelming
* You already have an ideal to-do list app

***Forest:***

REVIEW: I liked forest, however I did not find it that useful as I just stopped the app whenever my brain decided to be distracted again. Also, I had no major problem with just thinking instead of working.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You won‚Äôt just stare at the wall instead of doing work
* You have a moral objection to killing a fake/virtual tree
* You have enough self-discipline to actually turn it on

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You will gladly kill the fake tree
* You need reminders to use a system
* Your biggest distraction is something other than your devices

***Slash:***

REVIEW: I found slash to be a bit too rigid for my purposes, however, I can definitely see why it got popular and I understand why many people love it.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You need to be told what to do
* You want to track the time tasks take you
* You won‚Äôt get hyperfocused and just not check it

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You already have a to-do list you like
* You have many repeating tasks
* You have tasks that have specific times

***Monday.com***

REVIEW: I truly enjoyed using Monday.com as a stat fanatic, it was infinitely customizable, however sometimes that can be a bit overwhelming.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You really love stats
* You work with a team
* You need to track many things

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You want something simple
* You need a lot of reminders
* You want your done tasks to just dissapear

***Habitica:***

REVIEW: While habitica was an enjoyable and fun romp through my day, I felt that I spent a lot more time just playing around than actually getting stuff done.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You love video games
* You like the division into habits, tasks, and one-offs
* You like being in a community

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You will be distracted by the game mechanisms
* Leveling up your character has no appeal to you
* You like to prioritize

***Friday:***

REVIEW: I liked friday a lot, however I found it a bit hard to get the hang of at first, and too complex for my personal workflow.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You have a very specific organizational style
* You want to be able to integrate with other apps
* You like the timeblocking method

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You want something simple
* You‚Äôre easily overwhelmed
* You constantly change apps to manage your life

***Taskito:***

REVIEW: Taskito did not really work for me, as almost all my tasks are movable throughout the day (so I couldn‚Äôt benefit from the timeline). However, it‚Äôs a very well-designed app.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You like timelines
* You also need a to-do list
* You like being able to see your work in many different ways

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You suffer from time-blindness
* Your tasks are movable
* You find too many different views overwhelming

***HourStack:***

REVIEW: I liked hourstack, I can see why it would work for some people, however it just didn‚Äôt match with my workflow or brain.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You enjoy timeblocking
* You work with others
* Your tasks have set times

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You‚Äôre easily overwhelmed

* You need more customization
* Your tasks are movable
* You‚Äôre easily overwhelmed

**CATEGORY 4: HEALTH AND FITNESS**

***Daylio:***

REVIEW: I really liked using daylio, especially as someone who constantly wants to journal but hates writing. The option to log what I do and see the stats surround it really helped me keep track of how to make my days a bit less hard.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You don‚Äôt like writing
* You need a fast way to track your mood
* You like stats

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You like to go in detail about your day
* What you do changes on a daily basis
* You enjoy writing

***Flo:***

REVIEW: If you are a person with a period who also has ADHD, you most likely know the pain of never knowing when your period is going to come. To that end, Flo is helpful since it sends you notifications. On the bad side, it is a bit hard to log symptoms.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You like logging many symptoms and tracking lots of things
* You also potentially want to track pregnancy
* You enjoy social interaction

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You‚Äôre looking to only track a couple specific symptoms
* You really don‚Äôt like social interaction
* Ads are very distracting to you

***Headspace:***

REVIEW: I didn‚Äôt really love the meditations that were on headspace, but it was occasionally helpful with my emotional dysregulation to just slow down and stop. I found that just breathing slower on my own was equally helpful though.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You like guided meditations
* You are a bit short on time
* You have mood swings

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You find deep breathing really difficult
* You want to meditate for longer periods
* You won‚Äôt actually open the app

***Finch Self Care:***

REVIEW: I dislike writing about my day (or at least I‚Äôm terrible at it), so I didn‚Äôt like the focus on writing, however, the pet aspect was really nice.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You really like writing
* You need prompts
* The idea of a little pet amuses you

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You hate writing
* The pet will distract you
* You‚Äôre really short on time

***Clue:***

REVIEW: I enjoyed the visual interface of Clue, and found the short articles both helpful and fun to read. Overall, an excellent tracker app for my needs.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You want to track custom symptoms
* You like the circle diagram
* You like stats

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* Your symptoms change a lot
* You dislike the circle diagram and prefer a calendar view
* You like to write notes about your period

***Plant Nanny:***

REVIEW: In general, I did not love plant nanny, as I found it hard to understand and not that motivating (I just didn‚Äôt care about the plant). If you are a plant person though, you might like it.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You want a visual tracker
* The idea of a game is exciting to you
* You need reminders to drink water

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* The idea of a game is distracting to you
* You won‚Äôt really care about the plant
* You want an easy, simple system

**CATEGORY 5: HABIT BUILDING:**

***Productive:***

REVIEW: I really enjoyed productive! It was easy to use and fun to keep on track with. There were some minor bugs but nothing that kept it from being functional.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You want an easy system to keep track of your habits
* You have specific times for some of your habits and not others
* You like icons and colours

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You find too much personalization distracting
* You need tangible rewards for doing your habits
* You need extensive stats

***RabitHabit:***

REVIEW: While I liked using RabitHabit, I found that it pushed me to set times for almost all my habits (i.e. drinking water doesn‚Äôt always take the same amount of time). So, I found that inhibited much of my enjoyment.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You like a story-line and structure to learning habits
* You want a timer for your habits
* You like stats

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* Your habits don‚Äôt really have times
* You will get distracted by the story-line
* You aren‚Äôt a visual learner

***HabitHub:***

REVIEW: While HabitHub is definitely a good app, I just found myself getting really overwhelmed with all the different habits and tracker just there. But if you like seeing all of it at once I can see why this would be a good app.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You really like stats
* You aren‚Äôt visual
* You need to be able to see your habits at a glance

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You‚Äôre visual
* You get easily overwhelmed
* You need an aesthetic app

***Loop Habit Tracker:***

REVIEW: I actually really liked Loop Habit Tracker, even though I really only wanted to track a couple habits. It was really effective and I enjoyed the stats.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You like one-click trackers
* You like stats
* You like seeing all your habits at once

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You‚Äôre easily overwhelmed
* You only want to track a couple habits
* You want something really simple

***Habit Forest:***

REVIEW: Habit Forest was a fun app to use, but I found myself way too distracted with my forest which made it harder to actually do any of the habits I set out to do.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You like games
* You need a reward for completing your habits
* You want an aesthetic app

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You‚Äôre easily distracted
* You want something simple
* You have a lot of habits you want to build

***Habit Tracker: Daily Planner:***

REVIEW: While the visual appeal of this app was amazing, most of my habits (drinking water, etc) need to be repeated throughout the day, and I simply don‚Äôt need to know that I drank one glass of water at 1:34pm.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You‚Äôre visual
* You like stats
* You want to be able to recap what you did in the day

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* Most of your habits need to be repeated throughout the day
* Your habits don‚Äôt have specific times

**SOME CLOSING WORDS:**

So that‚Äôs the end! 550 days of work for 3500 words. At the end of the day, the apps I ended up wanting to use after the two week period were: Tiimo, Routinery, Water Do, Monday.com, Daylio and Productive (they all made the best in this category section). Making this list was a little bit very exhausting so I hope that it helps at least one person :)

And also it should be noted that I still don‚Äôt have a system that totally works. Thanks, brain.",r2zi3r,4622,1.0,351,2021-11-26 23:22:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/r2zi3r/i_spent_over_500_days_trying_productivity_apps_so/,False,False,2021,11

7,Netflix's Stigmatizing Adderall Rant,"I'm so annoyed. I was just watching Explained: The Mind on Netflix and in an episode they did about focusing they very briefly talk about Adderall and all they really say is that it's addictive, we don't know the long term effects and this women comes on and talks about being addicted to Adderall. She describes getting it from a friend in college and she never ever says anything about whether or not she has ADHD. and she talks about her experience as if it's absolutely universal, she says, ""This is what it feels like"" and I am just so sick of this drug being stigmatized. They never acknowledge that some people do need Adderall to function. I'm so angry! They just mentioned it to call it bad, and it's supposed to be this really well researched show...I've enjoyed other episodes of it but this was just so bad. It kind of felt like they made this episode really quickly because it just did not feel thoughtful at all. The episodes are really short, only about 30 minutes, and that's definitely not a lot of time to get into much, but I just think it was so careless to only hear from someone who's had a negative experience with Adderall. And Adderall has helped me function so much better. And no, it doesn't feel like it's sucking my soul out or some shit that this false narrative keeps pushing. I finally know what my brain needs and I am finally able to function like everyone else.

9,Boyfriend just told me he thinks I'm exaggerating the extent to which ADHD affects my life and asked me to convince him he doesn't have ADHD as a result :/,"Idek what to do, man. He was supportive of my diagnosis and my attempt to get medication some time soon, but when I was saying I get bored with exercising even because I liked it, he suggested exercising while watching a show, to which I said I couldn't bc if my ADHD and explained why.

Then he just kinda had that smug ""Haha okay, sure"" look and I asked him why he seems to not believe I have ADHD.

When I started explaining it to him in more detail, he was like ""Oh so, you don't think I can convince a doctor I have ADHD when I don't ? I don't think ADHD is that serious"" and just kinda kept dismissing all my symptoms, my diagnosis, my lived experiences growing up with ADHD, etc etc.

I'm just... So hurt ?? I feel dismissed ??? I'm kind of starting to doubt myself ? Idk.



EDIT: Oh wow, hello y'all. I didnt expect this to get the attention it got.

All of your comments have been insightful, considering how many of you guys had similar experiences, to which I'm sorry about.

Someone here said I've probably been talking about it a lot, and in retrospect, I have. When we were kind of arguing, I said ""Do you even know what it's like to grow up convinced you're lazy and not applying yourself and all this bad shit, only to grow up and find out it wasn't me the entire time ? ADHD affects everything for the individual, and I mean everything"" and compared how he wouldn't be treating a (for lack of better term) low functioning autistic person the way he was me. When he told me to convince him he doesn't have ADHD, I even suggested getting him tested if he's so needs convincing, and that there are low income options where we are.

I guess the most frustrating part is how I know he's seen so many of my symptoms (fidgeting: biting nails, pulling hair, chewing on things / talking fast and interrupting / etc) but is still skeptical about how much of my weird ""quirks"" and messiness and such are actually ADHD. He's seen it all ! Every symptom I have, he's seen it, and I know he has because he actively tries to stop my nail biting and stuff. 

For those who are questioning his general demeanor: he really is sweet and supportive of me and everything I do, but this one thing is what he's skeptical about. I would have rather him skeptical about me doing art as a side business or something. Something small. He has supported and encouraged me in everything from my art, to my jobs, to my friends. Just why not this ?

I told him I can't expect him to understand every little bit about being in my brain, but that I at least want him to try, and that he can't dictate my experiences from a non-ADHD perspective.

I plan on talking to him about it later because after our little argument, I just took a shower and went to sleep. I was just too tired.

But thank you all for your love and support, and sharing your experiences with me :)",qn74rr,3208,0.98,727,2021-11-05 09:13:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/qn74rr/boyfriend_just_told_me_he_thinks_im_exaggerating/,False,False,2021,11

13,"Fun with ADHD: I like to play a game called ""How Many of These Do I Need to Own Before I Can't Misplace Them Anymore.""","I kept losing tennis balls. Admittedly, I had help with this since they're for the dog, but still. Lose 3, buy another can, rinse and repeat. I wondered how many balls I needed to own before I could reliably find one when I needed it. Turns out the answer is 9.  The saturation point for tennis balls in my little house is 9.  And now I can be pretty sure I'll find one with only a little bit of looking. 

Likewise, I got to where I was losing my glasses every day. Literally. I tried getting a granny chain but I lost that too. Since my dog ate a pair, and my kids twisted my replacement pair into modern art, and I found out I could get them pretty cheap on the internet, I bought a third pair. Boy, there's nothing like throwing good money after bad. 

And, it turns out, the saturation point of glasses is three pairs!  Now, even when I can't find my glasses on waking up or after a shower, I have only to ask my wife if she's seen a pair and, usually, she has. It's always a fun little surprise to find out which pair I'll be wearing today. The ones with teeth marks on the lenses?  The ones with akimbo arms that sit more or less vertically on my face?

14,"What ""ADHD-hacks"" have you tried that actually worked?","I'm always curious as to what tricks, life hacks, and methods seems to actually help people with adhd manage their symptoms. 

Many tips given to me by professionals were never any helpful because they all relied on the idea that I just had to work harder, which of course made me quit maybe one or two tries in. For example, reminders on the phone? Only makes me annoyed. Mindfulness meditation? Makes me so frustratingly bored that I want to fight.

However, some tips given to me by actual ADHD-ers have worked much better. 

For example, I got the tip to hang my pants on shower curtain rings in my closet as opposed to putting them in a drawer because I just forget I own them, and I've kept at it for years and it still works! Much less work than pant-hangers but fills the same purpose.

Another thing is the ""task bracelet system"" where for each task I make a bracelet and put that around my wrist. Once the task is finished I put the bracelet in a big bowl. It gives me a sense of accomplishment, and the bracelet helps me to remember to do the thing and helps me get back on track if I get distracted. At the end of the day I'll have a bowl full of bracelets and it gives me another accomplishment-boost seeing how much I did today.

What ADHD-hacks have you tried that actually worked for you? Are there any that surprised you?

**EDIT:** A few have asked about the bracelets and I answered in the comments but I'll repeat myself here!

Basically they can be made literally however you want, but the most common way I've seen people do it is that they buy a bunch of spiral hair ties/bracelets and key tags and write a reoccurring task on it. 

Whenever you need to get that task done you put it on, and don't take it off until it's done. You'll probably have multiple bracelets on at the start of the day, which is gonna annoy the hell out of you and you'll be more motivated to get shit done! 

Not to mention that when you take off the bracelet and put it in the ""finished"" jar (or box, or bowl- whichever floats your goat) you get a dopamine hit! And seeing the jar full of finished tasks at the end if the day makes you feel really accomplished too.

I actually found this tip on TikTok, so to get more info you should head over there and look through the taskbracelet hashtag! You'll see other people's setup and what materials they used and all that stuff üëç‚≠ê",qlb8yt,2898,1.0,1292,2021-11-02 18:51:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/qlb8yt/what_adhdhacks_have_you_tried_that_actually_worked/,False,False,2021,11

‚ÄúI brought up my past because I want you and need you to understand. Please do the same because I want to understand you too babe.
And I will do research, watch and read all about it.

You are incredibly smart, great and dark sense of humor like me. 
Do what makes you happy and fuck what others think. You are important.

I noticed there was a pattern to when I get into these moods of worry. For me it's usually at night when I'm in bed.

I decided not to believe anything negative that my mind tells me at that time. Absolutely nothing at all. Instead I remind myself firmly that my brain is not currently reliable and that I'll be glad to think over the same topic in the morning. But not now.

It's a small thing, but it helps such a great deal.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Is this a reasonable ultimatum? 
Tbh I‚Äôm not sure how to feel about this. While I understand that living with an adhd partner as a NT can be challenging. This particular thing hurts me because before getting in a relationship, he was aware of my ‚Äòproblem‚Äô and acted very ‚Äòaccepting‚Äô of it at the beginning. 

Over time, things that before were just occasional inconveniences have turned into massive aggression triggers for him. 
For example..
Me not remembering very specific details about something. Which to him makes any argument of mine invalid, because I don‚Äôt remember the situation *exactly* how it happened. So I‚Äôm ‚Äògaslighting‚Äô.

Occasionally forgetting small chores.

Not fully being able to keep up with a long conversation. ( Says I don‚Äôt care to listen) 

Me clarifying my actual intentions things before apologizing for saying or doing something that upset him. He takes it as me ‚Äòmaking excuses‚Äô.

All these, among other things, have made him believe that my ADHD is *the* reason our relationship is problematic and I need to get medication or else he cannot be with me. I personally feel like the things mentioned above are things that can be fixed with a little bit more of compassion and communication. But he‚Äôs not having it. 

Recently, he‚Äôs also mentioned to me that if he meets someone else that is ‚Äúmore stable‚Äù he will go ahead and take that route rather than wait for me. Which to me is very discouraging because then .. what is the point?

I‚Äôm devastated because I feel like a failure. I try to do anything he says I need to ‚Äòfix‚Äô because I love him, and I want to make him happy, but my friends say these are abusive tactics? 

I mentioned to him that I was scared of getting medication because it makes me feel like a ‚Äòzombie‚Äô sometimes. But he responded that he would probably like that more than me, currently. Is that shitty to say?

3,"My best ADHD tip: when you get your prescription, take 7 pills out and put them in last month's empty container. When you run out of meds in 3 weeks and need to open the old container, that's your reminder to order your new prescription.","Basically, title.

*Fluff*

This has been a huge help for me. I'm sure we can all agree that ADHD diagnosis and treatment is not very ADHD friendly! The controlled nature of the drugs due to the abuse by neurotypicals makes it hard to manage. The fact I have to get a new scrip signed off every month instead of a standing repeat prescription like most other meds actively gets in the way of treatment. And I'm sure I'm not the only one who's ever ran out of meds, and the resulting lack of motivation etc. without treatment lead to an awful feedback loop that made it harder to actually go and get the meds to fix the problem!

*Actual Content*

So for me, I get my little bottle every 28 days. I take out 7 days worth, move them to last months bottle, and put that to the side. In 21 days, I'll empty my new bottle. On the day I do that, I'll contact my GP/Pharmacy and ask for my next prescription to be filled. The physical act of having to get the other bottle is my reminder that I'm almost out and to get more. That way, I still have 7 days of meds to last while my next prescription is filled.

I haven't once missed a dose since I discovered this, I hope it helps some of you out!

TL:DR because you also have ADHD;
Put a weeks meds aside each month, when you ""run out"" a week early, order new meds and the ""spare"" weeks pills last till your prescription is ready. Never be without meds again :)",rj707b,3988,0.99,240,2021-12-18 12:59:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rj707b/my_best_adhd_tip_when_you_get_your_prescription/,False,False,2021,12

5,Psychiatrist is more concerned about a fetus that I‚Äôm not carrying rather treating me for an issues I‚Äôve dealt with for 15 years.,"I‚Äôm finally at a point in my life where I‚Äôm financially able to seek care through a psychiatrist and begin getting treated for my ADHD again. I was extremely excited for this appointment given how hard it has been for me and finally feeling hopeful for some change. 

Well. Let me tell you. The entire experience was horrendous. She told me that stimulants weren‚Äôt going to magically make me want to start doing things, and that if I didn‚Äôt have a solid plan about how I was going to start holding myself more accountable, then she wasn‚Äôt going to treat me with stimulants. So you‚Äôre telling me that this whole time I just haven‚Äôt been coming up with solid plans to hold myself accountable? Wow, I didn‚Äôt know it was so simple. Im so sick of coping mechanisms. I can make list and keep a calendar all day, but there are still so many issues to be addressed that medicine would help. 

She asked me so many questions about why I didn‚Äôt feel like I was able to accomplish certain task, and when I told her my answers she continued to make me feel like the biggest idiot. I wanted to disconnect from the call right then and there. My head was spinning. 

She ended the appointment by asking me about my sex life. I told her I‚Äôm currently sleeping with one person. She asked if I was on birth control. I am not. I hate birth control. I‚Äôve never had a good experience. Don‚Äôt really feel like I have to explain that to anyone. It‚Äôs my body. She told me that before my next appointment I have to talk to my partner about pregnancy, and that stimulants are not a good enough reason for terminating a pregnancy. 

She said she believes that I have ADHD, but she said she didn‚Äôt feel comfortable prescribing me anything until then. She was about to not even prescribe my usual SSRI. I‚Äôve just never had an experience like this ever. Just wow. 

Had an immediate meltdown after getting off the phone. I‚Äôve never been so upset from a healthcare professional.

Edit: Sorry for typos in the title. I‚Äôm awful.

Edit: I would like to say since so many are asking, no I did not just walk in there asking for stimulants. I have been on stimulants in the past, so I did list those as medications that I‚Äôve taken prior. She full on just assumed that that‚Äôs what I wanted. I am open to stimulants as they have worked for me. I am ALSO open to other treatments as well.

2. Guaranteed way to remember that you did something; do a little dance after you do it.

I‚Äôm never 100% sure if I locked my door leaving the house or if I locked my car doors, but whenever I lock the door I do a quick little dance and I always remember doing a stupid dance after I locked my door or turned off the lights.

15,If there was a cure for ADHD would you take it?,"I‚Äôve asked a lot of questions recently on this subreddit just because it‚Äôs incredible to be surrounded by other people who understand me and understand the struggles of ADHD. 

If there was a cure for ADHD, would you take it? 

I wouldn‚Äôt, even though for many, including myself, ADHD makes life incredibly difficult in so many ways. I feel like ADHD has somewhat contributed to why I have such a bubbly personality and gives me a unique perspective on things, and I love how I have so many hobbies and passions. 

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a ‚Äúright or wrong‚Äù answer on something like this. Ultimately it‚Äôs up to how ADHD has affected you, but it‚Äôs an interesting hypothetical that I often think about.

Edit: I wanted to clarify that I don‚Äôt think ADHD or ADD is a personality trait. I just think it can influence or affect someone‚Äôs personality. These affects can be both positive and negative,  but I have enjoyed what many consider the ‚Äúpositive‚Äù affects are like the creativity and the endless amounts of energy.

Edit #2: Thank you for everyone who has been commenting. My heart goes out to everyone who have struggled so much with ADHD or ADD. Everyone‚Äôs opinions have been so enlightening and honestly it is crazy how people can have such different experiences with ADHD. I know it‚Äôs hard and sometimes we can all feel so useless and not productive but I truly believe there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. Feel free to reach out to me if you‚Äôd like someone to talk to!



Edit #3: I‚Äôm in no way trying to invalidate people‚Äôs experiences regarding ADHD. If it‚Äôs genuinely coming across that way, then I‚Äôm very sorry.

1.

0,"I had to report and fire my therapist because she told me everything i suffer with, is because im an aries","The title really says it all but:

Back in 2020 i had a mental breakdown that landed me in a partial program for 4 months. I was released when i was given to my therapist (they didn't want me to be discharged without having a therapist). We'll call her P.

P was an intern, which kind of in a way upset me because i had requested someone who specializes in trauma as i have PTSD and ADHD.

Our first session went okay, the words out of her mouth were ""Yeah so i don't believe in EVERYTHING when it comes to mental health care"" (ok but why are you doing this then lmao). We were getting to know each other as you would in the first session. At one point she had made a comment that ""oh my god thats such an aries thing!"" (Im not against people who believe in astrology, but now i don't trust people who do)

Our second session was where i was completely sideswiped. I was telling her that i have a really hard time starting projects and when i do, I can't finish them. Almost in tears as im saying it because i hate that I can't finish things. She goes ""It could be mental illness, or it could totally be an aries thing!""

I have a real hard time advocating for myself, but i wasn't about to have someone tell me my issues/things i suffer with are because of when i was born. I felt so invalidated after that second session that i cried on the way home. 

3 days later i manage to muster up the courage to call and ask for a supervisor. Ya'll she was so shocked she was speechless. Needles to say i was immediately placed on another wait list to be seen by someone else. Who i currently now see and she is wonderful.

But thats the story of my zodiac therapist, and i will never not joke about it. I'll be moody and start laughing and go ""oh its because im an aries!"" ü§£

Don't be afraid to speak up friends!

Edit: I didn't expect to wake up for my 4am shift with so many comments and validation, let alone awards. Thank you all so much! Self advocating is super hard, but i always remind people that its sometimes something we unfortunately have to do. Holding people accountable is hard.
It was a very awkward situation for me, but i wasn't going to be invalidated with everything ive been through especially after being in a partial program.

It. was. hell. No medication (I wish I had, but it's very complicated - in my country we don't even have it - ADHD is not recognized, and where I moved it's too expensive for me - insurance doesn't cover it).¬†

All the guilt, and anxiety, and panic, and guilt, and pressure... its over!! It doesn't feel like it?¬†

I struggle to feel happy and proud. I know I should be - but I still feel like I have to work on my thesis. ‚Äã

6,ADHD is long-overdue to be renamed.,"Calling ADHD ""Attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder"" is like calling depression ""feel sad and can't get out of bed disorder."" It does little to describe the struggle, and the label itself trivializes the problems it causes.

Many people with ADHD are not ""hyperactive,"" and most adults don't display that symptom in the traditional sense. I.e. I am an introvert and anxious. At times of high energy and low anxiety, I am hyperactive. But I'm rarely high energy, and I'm rarely low anxiety. Heck, and alcohol actually gives me more self-control while it kicks in. The hyperactivity is just a result of unregulated energy, and it's the *lack of regulation* that is the disorder, not the hyperactivity.

But I don't know how to describe the blocked self-regulation of my daily life. It literally feels like that part of my brain is numb, and before I took medications, I never even knew what it felt like to have access to that, so I didn't notice the deficit. But after having that experience, my brain knows what part is missing, so it's like my neurons are constantly looking for feedback from that now, but it's just all blocked, like my arm fell asleep, except it's the part of my brain that focuses.",s7jazi,5039,0.99,807,2022-01-19 06:09:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/s7jazi/adhd_is_longoverdue_to_be_renamed/,False,False,2022,1

8,ADHD is a Disability,"...And don't ever let someone tell you it is not.

Where I live, ADHD medication is highly regulated. I have to schedule an appointment every month with my doctor, to which I take a drug test **monthly**. I've been taking this medication for SEVEN years. To give you an idea, that is 84 drug tests in total I have taken just to get my medication.

Every month, I run out of my medication and have about 2-3 days where I have to wait, unmedicated, to schedule and go to an appointment with my Physician. With my work schedule, there is no telling when I'll be needed, so scheduling ahead of time is out of the question. Can I work without it? Sure. Would I still be employed at my job without it? Absolutely not. Most employers don't acknowledge ADHD to the same level as other ADA qualified disabilities. 

The biggest issue (out of many) I've had with my ADHD has always boiled down to energy.  If I were to explain how ADHD works to those without it, I would say it's like you took Melatonin as soon as you wake up in the morning...and you **kept on taking it** throughout the day. You could imagine it would be hard enough to stay awake, let alone do anything productive. Now imagine you do that **every day for the rest of your life**.

So you keep looking at content on your phone that you think might fill the hole, but nothing quite scratches that itch and every time you close your phone to get up, you feel the loss of what little stimulation you did find on youtube or twitter, and immediately open the app back up without even realizing it. You end up glued to the coutch trying to scratch that itch so you can get on with your day.


Some days I can't even leave my house without the right podcast episode or audio-book in my ears, so when I can't scratch the itch, I'm just stuck.

EDIT: to clarify, I specifically mean when you feel like you need to find the *right* piece of content before you can feel fulfilled and move on with your day. I don't mean scrolling just because you're bored. Sometimes I do actually find it and am able to move on. but most times I'm stun locked and glued to my seat until I can satisfy the urge.

EDIT2: Since this is getting a lot of traction and I want to elevate the response I found the most helpful so far, which says to put down the phone and then literally do nothing. That is to say, sit in silence and do either controlled breathing and/or close your eyes. essentially, meditate, even if it isn't mediation, for at least a few seconds to sort of soft reset your brain. thank you to u/happygocrazee


EDIT3: Had my session with my adhd specialist/life coach today. She went into all the chemistry of it, but the conclusion was that the only two things that *reset* your brain are exercise and music, so music it is then when I get stuck on the couch, lol! I think the sitting and doing nothing still helps for a short time, but if you want to be good for a while, play some music to shift your mood and go out for a walk. For those of you who keep switching songs, she said you need to give the music time to do it's work.

16,"Follow up post on my last post, I reported my Doctor to the medical board.","So in my last post on this subject I said I did not believe that my Doctor believed in ADHD. Well I got some evidence to that effect together and reported my doctor to my state's medical board. I just today got official word that they are doing a full investigation and things look good for me with just the evidence that I submitted. 

I found this out because my HMO got wind of it and I got a call from their legal department. I asked them what they expected after I demanded a new primary care physician because she didn't believe that the mental illness I have existed? They asked if I was going to drop them as health care and I told them I couldnt afford anyone else. 

So if you run into people being obtuse about ADHD in the medical field, get it in writing, Get it in your chart, Talk about it in emails, and go to your state's medical board and tell on them. We aren't petulant children we are grown ass adults (to the children in the audience petulant or otherwise your day will come). It is up to us to force the industry to oust bad actors within the community.

I had a friend who said ""Jesus you are going to ruin their life because you had a speed bump in getting your meds?"" No I am ruining their life because they are a harm to others and need to be removed from a position of power over people's health. If someone can look at test results that clearly show ADHD and decide they don't like that then they can decide that people with PTSD are just weenies or that people with diabetes need to just diet more carefully.

21,ADHD Pro Tip: Your muscles may be way more tense than you realize.,"For years I've had upper back and neck problems for which I've seen multiple doctors and they've always taken a few X-Rays and told me that everything looks fine.

A few weeks ago I was watching a physical therapist on youtube talking about issues similar to what I have and showed a few stretches and recommended a massage wand for working out tight muscles that could be causing the problem.

I decided to purchase a percussion massager and give it a try. Within the first few minutes I'd worked out a major knot in my shoulder that was causing further tension in my neck, which I then proceeded to work out.

As I got each muscle loosened I realized how tight the ones next to it are.

Over about an hour period I discovered that pretty much my entire back and neck were so tense and tight all of the time that I had no idea it was even happening.

I feel like I'm two inches taller and so much pain has been alleviated.

To be clear, I'm not a doctor and this is not medical advice, but I can't imagine I'm the only person with ADHD who has major issues with muscle tension.

Edit 2: dang, tons of responses! Lots of people are saying it‚Äôs not really laziness, (although from what I gather, all of us have been called lazy) it‚Äôs more of an inability to do things. I definitely relate to that. I guess I just said lazy because that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve always thought it was, or like I lacked discipline and motivation. The way other people have been able to ‚Äújust do‚Äù things, I haven‚Äôt always, and when I do get myself to do things it takes me longer to complete them than I think is normal.

25,So the psychiatrist asked for my school reports - I'm 47...,"...and thought there'd be no hope at all and even if they did exist I recall them to be boring AF.

Visited my folks over Christmas and asked about whether they kept them - what!? why would we do that? Was the expected response.

On boxing day I spotted a box labelled ""Kev's stuff"" in the garage. I pulled it down and found a bunch of stuff I must've packed away when I left for college. A model helicopter I made, my 21st present of a barometer (family tradition), three volumes of Gary Larson, a Calvin and Hobbes, and most surprising of all my last four high school reports covering two years and leaving testimonial!

Yeah, they were boring.

The boring reports included highlights such as:

""Kevin is an irrepressibly cheerful student. Greater levels of concentration between outbursts of good humour would help results."" 

""Kevin has managed to attain some very good results despite some lack of concentration in class""

""Kevin must meet his assignment deadlines""

""A slightly more serious approach to work is needed at this level""

""Has potential but does not always work to it""

And in my leaving testimonial:

""Kevin is a student of average academic ability and yet his teachers allude to him having considerably more potential than his grades would indicate so far. Kevin is an irrepressibly cheerful and good-natured student who is generally quiet and conscientious. Kevin has the capacity to do well, particularly in those areas that he finds interesting. I wish him well for his future.""

1,Told my boss and team that I have ADHD. Their reaction blew me away.,"I wanted to cry tears of joy. For **9 years** I never told my work I have ADHD because I was afraid they'd judge me and it would only have a negative impact. Also everyone said it was a bad idea to tell your work. I had to pretend I was neurotypical and it got SO exhausting.

I just started a new job at a new company and *finally* said ""fuck pretending, I'm going to be my genuine self now"" and I told my manager and my whole team I have ADHD. I explained how ADHD makes me work differently, struggles I face, my superpowers (hyperfocus and creativity), things that help me succeed, and that ADHD has no impact on intelligence. They were SO understanding and they made these accommodations:

- They let me record meetings. I told them that sometimes I miss key words or I need to re-listen to really understand. This helps IMMENSELY because I can listen to something 3 or 4 times and truly soak it in.

- My manager helps me plan out the week in our Monday meeting. She helps me put together concrete steps, which is so helpful.

- My manager understands that I need breaks when I'm overthinking/overwhelmed.

- They give me opportunities to apply my creativity so I'm not stuck with just mind-numbing tasks

What's even more amazing is that my manager, who is a *Vice President*, shared that she has ADD and dyslexia. She even talked about her anxiety and insomnia. I've never heard an executive admit to having mental health conditions. It gave me hope that I can move up in the corporate world - I always felt like there was a glass ceiling on promotions with ADHD.

I just wanted to share my story about a positive experience telling my work about my ADHD. I'm not saying anyone else should do the same because your team might react differently especially if they're not progressive on mental health. Sadly, talking about mental health at work is a calculated risk. But I'm incredibly happy about my outcome and I'm hopeful for the future. The accommodations have already helped me be successful and get good feedback. I hope others have success stories like this. Thank you for reading.

Edit: Thank you all for the amazing comments! I'm glad my story made people happy. I hope it inspires some people to talk about their ADHD.

2,"Today I did a 30 minute presentation on Adult ADHD to a group of family doctors, them listening and seeing it click for them made all the effort worth it...","Today I presented a case to a group of family doctors, I chose to present a case of a 40yo person with ADHD...

It was quite the effort because I really wanted it to work and I was worried I would get eye rolls or people just brushing of what I said, and it just felt amazing when I saw people really paying attention to what I was talking, nodding as stuff started to make sense to them and things clicked into place... These were family doctors with decades seeing patients, I knew they had seen adult people with ADHD even if they had never considered it was adhd, and then understand the things that make their patients hurt and I could tell things were making sense to them...

I feel today was totally worth the effort, I finished writing the slides of my presentation 10 minutes before I was presenting, it had some horrible walls of text but I managed to keep it lighter with some humour and jokes, I even had the ""ADHD Iceberg"" as sort of a meme, I wanted to include a couple actual memes but these people are older and I couldn't find something I knew they would get...

Just a pic of my slides https://imgur.com/a/rFk6zQW

In my country the diagnosis is made by psychiatrists and the medication is handled by them too, so I focused on how to tell apart people with anxiety from people with adhd from people with adhd and anxiety, how the classic symptoms and the DSM-V criteria are good enough for children but for adults deeper understanding is needed, I told them about executive functions, working memory, time blindness, (crap I forgot to tell them about motivation!) mind wandering...

In the end I had to rush and make a couple parts quicker because it was suposed to be 20 min and I think maybe it was more like 30 by the end...

4,What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"It seems like every day on this sub I see a post of someone raving about their first day on medication being life changing. Usually it goes along the lines of ""wow I can't believe everyone feels like this normally! I feel great!"" 

While I'm happy to see others feel much needed relief from the debilitating symptoms of ADHD, I also think it's important to have realistic expectations of medication. The first week, it's possible you're experiencing euphoria as a side effect of the medication. After all, it's thrilling to be able to do the thing you've been putting off for ages. 

However, I do not believe non-ADHD people normally feel the way we do those first few days of taking medication. Things will level out and tasks still are difficult, especially after years of taking medication. That doesn't mean all hope is lost, not at all. What it does mean is that those first few months are critical to building structures that help your ADHD. Use the time you're feeling better on medication to build good habits. Incorporate daily exercise, figure out how to make simple nutritional meals, gather supportive connections, get a therapist/coach. Just don't rely solely on the medication to change your life, but use it as a tool to make the changes that will help you thrive.",skvbsu,3964,0.99,387,2022-02-05 02:09:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/skvbsu/what_i_wish_someone_had_told_me_when_i_started/,False,False,2022,2

6,"572 days later, I finished the Duolingo Chinese course!!!!!!!","I FREAKIN DID IT YALL!!!!!!! 572 days ago, I started doing daily Duolingo. I started because I wanted to have one small habit that I did every day to better myself. I was a mess; I had dropped out of college, wasn‚Äôt taking my meds, and felt like I was aimlessly drifting through my life. Like many people in this sub, my ADHD makes it stupidly difficult to stick with anything for long periods of time. I get bored, discouraged, then give up and try some other activity instead of finishing what I started. I promised myself this time I would actually stick it out and complete an entire language course. 

Duo‚Äôs reward system and reminders were incredible at helping me keep with the program. I hated them at first, but then came to appreciate the way they guilt tripped me into keeping my promise. After seeing how doing one small task everyday over time added up to big results, I began adding more little habits and eventually built a whole self care routine. I‚Äôve never ever done anything like that before. 

Thanks to Duo showing me the power of healthy habits, I reenrolled in classes (and graduated this December!!!), went back to therapy/restarted meds, began writing a daily journal, and overall feel more in charge of the path my life is on. I still can‚Äôt believe I stuck with something for 572 days straight. Absolutely blows my mind. 

Thanks for sharing in my excitement!! ‰ªäÂ§©Êôö‰∏äÊàëÈùûÂ∏∏È´òÂÖ¥ÔºÅ



Edit: Thank you kind strangers for the encouraging words and awards!!!


E2EB: I can‚Äôt believe how many people have responded to this!! I‚Äôm trying to reply to as many comments as I can. Celebrating this win with all of you makes me feel connected to a community. If I can do it, so can you :)


Edit 3: Êó©ÂÆâÂ§ßÂÆ∂‰∫∫ÔºÅ(Good morning everyone!) 


To answer some of the comments about my Chinese proficiency before/after Duolingo:

-My Chinese proficiency after completing Duolingo is intermediate. I‚Äôve took a free online HSK tests and I‚Äôm level HSK4 fluent. 

-Duolingo was great for teaching me to read characters/pinyin. But my speaking/listening comprehension could use improvement. I‚Äôm looking to find a speaking partner/tutor to get better at spoken conversations. 

-I did take Chinese lessons in elementary school for a few months. My parents forced me into them, so I never practiced outside of class and therefore retained only the most basic of basics. This helped me with recognizing tones, which is definitely an area Duo needs improvement in. When I started Duo, I tested out of the first 3 lessons (stuff like numbers 1-10, hello/goodbye, my name is ____). The two best things I remember about lessons growing up were making È•∫Â≠ê (jiao zi, dumplings) and the phrase È©¨È©¨ËôéËôé(ma ma hu hu). 


Why I chose Chinese/what kept me motivated:

-I wanted to learn Chinese because of China‚Äôs growing economic and cultural influence on the world. I didn‚Äôt want to reply on google translate to interact with people online and/or read Chinese news sites. I also wanted to break out of my very ‚ÄòMerican expectation that everyone knows English lol

-I told myself 5 minutes/1 lesson was better than none whenever I felt tired or lazy. Once I saw my streak get to the triple digits, I was too invested to consider losing it. I let myself get invested in climbing the weekly leagues and completing all the achievements.


EDIT 4: GRAMMAR FACTS

Chinese is an extremely logical language. I love its simple elegance. The sentence structure is almost always SUBJECT VERB OBJECT. To say something like ‚Äúwhere are you right now?‚Äù is ‚Äú‰Ω†Áé∞Âú®Âú®Âì™ÂÑøÔºü‚Äù which literally translates to ‚Äúyou now location where‚Äù. 

Another thing I like about the grammar is the possessive ÁöÑ„ÄÇIf something is yours, you put ÁöÑ in front of it. ‚ÄúThis is my cat‚Äù is ËøôÊòØÊàëÁöÑÁå´„ÄÇÊàë = me,I ÁöÑ = possessive (together, ÊàëÁöÑ = my) and Áå´ = cat. 

‰ªñÔºåÂ•πÔºå& ÂÆÉ„ÄÇAll three characters are pronounced the same (ta). But the first one means him, the second is her, and the last is ‚Äòit‚Äô (for referring to animals, ‚ÄúËøôÊòØÊàëÁöÑÁå´„ÄÅÂÆÉÊòØÂÖ´Â≤Å‚Äù ‚Äúthis is my cat, it is 8 years old‚Äù). So if you‚Äôre in a spoken conversation, you need more context to figure out the gender of the person you‚Äôre talking about.

I bought an ipad to draw and havent touched it in months. 

I bought a bunch of baking stuff because I wanted to learn how to bake. Only made 1 recipe and lost interest.

I invested in lots of skincare products at one point and theyre all unopened and probably have expired lol

So, I was wondering if you guys may have experienced ""hearing issues"", too? I'm thinking that it's an ability to process things quickly. I very often ask people to repeat what they say, I lean in close to them to make sure I hear every word. And I cannot for the life of me read lips.

2,"ohhhhh, no wonder parents don't think ADHD is real","ok, so if ADHD is genetic, odds are one or both of your parents have it too. but if they never got a diagnosis, then they've just dealt with it their entire lives and have gotten to a point where they don't even consider it a possibility. this is especially true if your parents are way too boomer to go see someone about their mental health. so if you exhibit the same symptoms they just think you take after them. after all, you're their kid, so naturally they'd expect you to act kinda like them. and then they try to give you the same ""coping skills"" which of course won't necessarily work, especially considering you're a generation removed so it's a different ballgame.

huh.

edit: boy, this took off. btw, for any actual baby boomers, i want to point out i have nothing against baby boomers per se. when i say ""too boomer"" i'm referring to the people of that generation who are toxic and/or willfully ignorant. <3",t9pkb8,6405,0.99,867,2022-03-08 20:05:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/t9pkb8/ohhhhh_no_wonder_parents_dont_think_adhd_is_real/,False,False,2022,3

I would recommend finding out what it is that does tend to spark that interest/joy in them and take the initiative to pull that thing out yourself and start doing that activity.

7,I just got a six figures job!,"Since things are still kinda being finalized at the moment, I can't talk about this with a lot of people in my life but I'm kinda bursting with excitement, so I wanted to share this happiness with you guys. I just got a an awesome job offer with a six figures salary! 

That is amazing to me because between 2017 and 2019 I didn't work or study at all because of what I later discovered was depression and anxiety stemming from undiagnosed adhd. Basically, my undiagnosed adhd wrecked my life. I dropped out of college multiple times (still haven't graduated), couldn't hold down a job and struggled a lot with everyday things. My parents initially were very against psychological treatment though, so I just kept pushing, thinking if only I tried harder I would be able to get it together. 

Well, I didn't. Which led to this period of crisis between 2017 and 2019 when things got really bad and I was basically suicidal. I thought I had messed up my academic/professional life to a point of no return and that if I got a job at a starbucks or something, I should consider myself lucky.

Things only started changing when a friend basically staged an intervention and strongly suggested to my parents that they should invest in psychological treatment for me. I then eventually got diagnosed with ADHD and when I started taking meds everything suddenly got **a lot** easier for me.

Of course, undoing the mess I had made of my life wasn't instant, but in 2019 I started working again, first as a receptionist at a doctor's office. It was an awful job, so tiring because I had to interact with so many people and also speak on the phone a lot, which I hate. But it got me out of the house and the fact that I hated the job so much made me start thinking about alternatives.

Coding had always been something in the back of my mind because I liked doing websites when I was a teenager, but I only knew very basic stuff. I then started studying it, first on my own and then later at a bootcamp and then in 2021 I finally got a job as a software developer.  I live in South America but as you guys can see, I do speak english pretty well so my plan was always to stay a year at this job at a local company and after I had some experience, to search for a job that paid in dollars or in euros, since that would give me the ability to basically live anywhere in the world. 

And today I finally got that offer from an American company! It's so crazy to me because a few years ago I really thought that my life was over and I would basically be a drain on my family for the rest of my life since I didn't seem to be able to function and now, here I am! So if you're still in that rough part of your life, please don't give up!

8,I‚Äôm faking ADHD to get stimulant medication.,"**Edit 2: Some folks have correctly pointed out that this is a click-baity. Before reading, just a heads up that this is creative writing that describes my feelings of imposter syndrome in the context of ADHD.**

I‚Äôm faking ADHD to get stimulant medication. 

The meds make me feel focused and alert. 

They make me feel confidant and happy. 

They make me feel like I have control over my mind. 

When I‚Äôm medicated, I can stay on task. I have been staying on top of my emails at work. I‚Äôve been reading and drawing more. 

When I‚Äôm medicated, I can tell myself to do something that I‚Äôd normally avoid, and then I just get up and do it, without arguing with myself and procrastinating for hours or days.

When I‚Äôm medicated, I can listen to my husband talk about things and not space out and start thinking about groceries, or the cats, or work, or my outfit for tomorrow, or the feeling of the couch fabric on my hand, or how they get shipping containers off of boats and onto trucks, or how I need to book an appointment, or that dream I had last week. 

When I‚Äôm medicated, I don‚Äôt want to eat ice cream for every meal, I can tell myself not to get a cookie at Subway even though I really want one, I can make myself a healthy dinner and enjoy it. 

When I‚Äôm medicated, I can remember my plans for the day, even if I didn‚Äôt write them all down in my phone. 

When I‚Äôm medicated, I feel like life is a lot easier. Not perfect. But easier.

Even my doctor is fooled - on the phone yesterday he said ‚ÄúYeah, based on your reaction to the medication, I‚Äôm going to officially diagnosis you with ADHD‚Äù.

‚Ä¶I might have been prescribed stimulant medication because I have ADHD‚Ä¶

**Edit: Obviously I‚Äôm not actually faking for meds. Just wanted to type this up to express how imposter syndrome can be so insidious and contrary to reality.**

**I flaired this post as success/celebration because I feel that 1. I‚Äôve come a long way in being aware of how my brain can distort reality into insecurity, and 2. Because I‚Äôve finally received my diagnosis and am getting the right treatment.**",tz8uzn,3796,0.9,494,2022-04-08 17:34:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/tz8uzn/im_faking_adhd_to_get_stimulant_medication/,False,False,2022,4
9,Today I learned what ADHD medication actually does to the brain and it kind of changed the way i think about my brain.,"If you are like me, I have always been told ADHD meds calm the ADHD brain. So I know I took that at face value, I should be more calm right? Less random thoughts, less anxiety, more calm? Well when I was talking to be doctor and explained i dont feel calm or anything, she explained what the meds are actually doing in my brain in a way i have never heard or thought of myself. And this explanation kind of unlocked a lot of understanding of my own brain.

Brains need stimulation to perform executive function. Neurotypical brains need the ""normal"" amount of stimulations that a ""normal"" day will give them. (using the word normal very loosely). ADHD brains need more stimulation to perform and a normal day does not provide the level we need.

So what simulant meds do it provide the missing simulant our brain needs to do those same executive functions. Sounds obvious right? It very much was not for me as I was always told it ""calms the ADHD brain"" and I took that as *I will be more calm*. 

I will always have more racing thoughts, i will always be a bit more hyper or impulsive or whatever. But having meds explained to me in this way kind of helps me accept that. Im not going to be calm, that can't be me, but i am going to have my brains hunger for simulation met. It will bridge that gap so I dont have to try and bridge it myself with things that really wont help long term on in healthy ways. I was so stuck on the work ""calm"" that I started to feel like a failure. I had the stimulation vs. able to perform backwards. Meds don't lower my need to stimulation to perform, it provides it.

Without medication, the ADHD brain does two things to try and fix that gap of stimulation vs. able to perform. It will either look for extra stimulation through fidgeting, over eating, over spending, whatever else. So you will find yourself needing to write an essay but you end up watching youtube, playing video games or whatever else on the computer other than doing the task you need to. Or it will say ""hey this is took hard"" and shut down and you just can't perform anything, often times just mindless on the couch or bed.

This explanation might feels obvious to some, but it wasn't to me. And just hearing this is helping me not only understand my brain, but accept the way it works. I am not trying to fix it, lower my needs, invalidate it, I am giving it what it needs.",ty174m,3711,0.99,442,2022-04-07 01:08:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ty174m/today_i_learned_what_adhd_medication_actually/,False,False,2022,4

11,ADHD things I wish people talked about,"EDIT: So a lot of you have been saying that you'll be sending this post to your friends and family so I decided to make it more coherent and organized since this originally started out as a rant. I'll also be making it less personal so that your loved ones don't have to read about my embarrassing ADHD stories. 

So basically, ADHD is seen as ‚Äúquirky ahaha I can‚Äôt focus and I fidget a lot and... ooh is that a squirrel!!?‚Äù and I hate it. It‚Äôs not taken seriously at all and I blame the misinformation online.

So here is a list of ADHD things I wish people talked about: 

- Working Memory Issues: seriously, as soon as a thought comes to my mind, it goes away and I can‚Äôt remember what I was about to do or what I was thinking about. I need constant reminders in order to get anything done and important things like names, events, dates, and so much more feel impossible to remember without someone reminding me about them.  

- Time Jumps‚Ä¶Skips: I'm not sure what else to call this and this probably happens due to a combination of working memory issues and zoning out. I'll be so zoned out while doing something and then I'll snap out of it and suddenly minutes or hours have passed by and I can't remember what I was doing or why I was doing it. 

- Time Blindness: I can't differentiate between minutes and hours or months and years. My perception of time is so skewed. I'm always overestimating or underestimating how long something is going to take and this leads to being late to everything including school, family gatherings, outings with friends, and important appointments. 

- Emotional Dysregulation: it feels like I have intensified emotions and inappropriate reactions to everything. Dr. Russel Barkley said that our development is 30% behind our peers. That makes sense because I (F18) feel like I do have the emotions of a 12 year-old girl. I get angry and sad over the most trivial things and when I'm happy, I'm annoyingly happy. My emotions are turned up to 100%. I'm also overly sensitive to rejection. I do not take criticism well. If someone criticises me in anyway, I will lose my shit and have a mental breakdown. I will begin overanalyzing everything about myself and feel intense self-hatred even if the criticism that was given to me was constructive. If I sense the smallest shift in personality from my friends, I will also lose my shit. They could be having a generally bad day but I'll assume that it was somehow my fault and that everyone's mad at me (EDIT: I may also have co-morbid BPD, I‚Äôm figuring it out with my psychiatrist) 

- Impatience: I have this need for everything to be done NOW. I‚Äôll have a to-do list of 10+ things and I want them all to be done at the same time. This causes me to get overwhelmed and anxious which leads to doing nothing. I also interrupt people because I want them to TALK FASTER and I'll cry and get angry if something I want doesn‚Äôt happen NOW (related to emotional dysregulation). 

- Masking: because I‚Äôm hyperactive, some might say my personality is loud/annoying/obnoxious and so on. Of course, this leads to masking and masking caused me to develop social anxiety. My masking also consists of obsessively checking to compensate for my shit memory. It's a waste of time and it's exhausting. I've become a perfectionist in order to cover up my ADHD symptoms and avoid making silly mistakes. 

- Lack of Dopamine: this means I don't have the motivation to do anything that doesn‚Äôt give me instant dopamine, which means an inability to start a task, which means procrastination, which means missing deadlines. This also means that I‚Äôm chronically bored and constantly looking for a way to stimulate myself. 

- Constantly Drifting Away From My Friends: this is a mix of a ton of the other symptoms but mostly the fact that I'm too disorganised/overwhelmed/bored/forgetful to check up on my friends and I only talk to them when I‚Äôm physically with them which leads to drifting. 

- ""Out of Sight, Out of Mind"": if it's not in front of me, I will forget it exists (including my friends, which relates to my last point)

- Hyperfixations: I hate that the internet has changed the meaning of this word to mean anything you like or enjoy. Anyway, when I do have a hyperfixation, it becomes my only source of dopamine, it‚Äôs the only thing I can focus on, and the only thing I want to talk about. When I don‚Äôt have a hyperfixation, I become extremely understimulated and my symptoms look like depression until I find a new hyperfixation. 

- Inattention: I can‚Äôt drive, keep up with conversations, keep up with teachers, movies, books, etc 

- Can‚Äôt Take Care of Myself: can‚Äôt keep up with hygiene (due to lack of motivation or forgetfulness), I forget to drink water and eat food, I can‚Äôt clean my room, and I never remember to do my skin-care routine. 

- Distractibility: every sound and every movement will grab my attention and it makes it so hard to finish anything

- Sensory Issues: I get sensory overloads a lot probably due to the fact that I‚Äôm so hyperaware of my surroundings (every sound and movement) but I also have misophonia which worsens my sensory issues. 

- Brain Never Shuts Off: racing thoughts 24/7 and sometimes I just wanna sleep or focus and it feels impossible. Also, my brain works faster than my body, causing me to mess up my speech, writing, etc. 

- Others: issues with self-esteem and binge eating (due to lack of dopamine)

- Impulsiveness: I never think before I do anything. I impulse spend like crazy, I sometimes say insensitive things, and so on. 

I'm so glad this post resonated with so many of you and I'm glad we can have these types of conversations since we all know what it feels like. ADHD is an extremely exhausting and debilitating disorder to live with and not many people understand that.

12,"I just got fired from my dream job after 4 months. I tried so hard. I got on meds, I upped the dose, I added a second one, I went out of my way to be easygoing, and find extra work.

15,"Meds don't give me motivation. They help me stay focused and finish tasks, which over time builds my confidence, which makes starting things less scary and hence require less motivation","I was reflecting on this today. It's odd because objectively I have been getting a lot more done since starting medication, but at the same time medication doesn't seem to just directly give me magical motivation. It's not like I take my medication and suddenly *want* to do all that boring work I know I have to do. However, I think what is happening over time is that I am learning more and more that I am now better able to finish things once I start them, and also that the process of finishing them is not nearly as painful as it used to be. The more my subconscious believes this the less I fear work and the less it feels overwhelming to start tasks. So in a way I'd say that while medication does not directly give me motivation, it indirectly (over time) makes work less aversive and scary so I require less motivation to get started on it. So in this way I'm getting a lot more done than I used to, and not *just* because I am more likely to finish the things I start, but also because I'm more likely to start things quicker instead of putting them off forever.",twgizv,3497,1.0,189,2022-04-04 23:27:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/twgizv/meds_dont_give_me_motivation_they_help_me_stay/,False,False,2022,4

17,What is a symptom you didn't realize was related to ADHD until you were diagnosed?,"Hey guys. I'm hoping to see a psychiatrist soon and i wanted to be prepared for when that happens since some of you had recommended that. I want to create a list of symptoms I have so I can explain myself clearly. I tend to forget my symptoms and it is such a hassle trying to think of them especially when I'm anxious, which I will likely be when I go there. Thank you for all your help, you've honestly been wonderful! I feel very at home in this sub, I'm very thankful for all of you lovely people.

Edit: thank you all for your responses. Unfortunately I can't get to all of them but they've been very helpful. Someone told me to make a small list of the ways it inconveniences me so here's that if anyone's interested. (There's obviously more but I wanna keep it brief for now)

1) Wanting to do everything at once and getting overwhelmed and not doing anything.

2)Getting a new hobby, focusing on it and then leaving it pretty soon after.

3)Brain won't shut off. Very hard time trying to fall asleep.

4)Forgetting absolutely everything. Frankly I do not know anything about my life. 

5)Jumping from one topic to another when I'm speaking. Completely random thoughts. Also interrupting people very often. 

6)Overeating.

7) Zoning out/ being distracted easily.

8)Being impulsive, overspending.

9)Always super tired no matter how much I sleep. Caffeine making me sleepy. 

10) Constant fidgeting/messing with my fingers/leg bounce.


Edit 2: if anyone is interested, I think I just got diagnosed with anxiety? ü§† That was highly underwhelming and she didn't listen/ called ADHD hyperactivity soooo,,, yeah anyway she prescribed me something for anxiety. I'll keep you updated? Maybe it isn't ADHD after all.

18,"I struggle to do ""the thing"" if ""vibe"" isn't right","This is something I've struggled with my whole life. It's hard to explain, but I associate different tasks/chores with different ""vibes"". The vibe for putting laundry away is that lazy sunday afternoon feeling, so it doesn't happen until that vibe hits. For cooking, it's comfy clothes, no rush, turn on some cooking show and have fun- so I struggle with the normal everyday cooking. I could keep going. Sometimes I know what ""vibe"" I need to feel motivated, other times I have no clue. But when I force myself to do ""the thing"" without the ""vibe"", if don't freeze, it's almost physically painful. 

Does anyone else struggle with this? Any tips on how to trick my brain into feeling the vibe even when it's not there?",tf0tqg,3182,1.0,351,2022-03-15 21:27:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/tf0tqg/i_struggle_to_do_the_thing_if_vibe_isnt_right/,False,False,2022,3
19,I feel like I lost myself in the Covid pandemic,I used to be a dynamic person with a big part of my ADHD being hyper focusing on stuff. It wasn‚Äôt always useful it often distracted be but I had passion and was getting at least something done. But since the isolation I lost connection to the outside world and feel like I‚Äôve been decaying. I can‚Äôt pay attention to anything for fifteen seconds before my brain turns to mush. I just feel so lost and can‚Äôt connect to the world anymore.

21,"Moved 1000 miles for a job offer. Fired for a forgetful mistake. :( Lost my housing, now homeless and stranded.","I was living in an amazing city close to the east coast but it was bad for my mental health so I was applying for jobs elsewhere. They gave me a good offer more than I was expecting. I'm pretty qualified in my field (oil and gas) so I took it, moved my entire life and all my belongings over 1000 miles to the middle of nowhere in Utah.

The job was okay but super corporate and there was little direction from upper management. Not good for me. Made a small mistake and I was fired :( I had zero performance issues before this. It stung pretty badly.

Not to mention my mom died suddenly after the move. So I wasn't in the best mental state which exacerbated my ADHD symptoms and absolutely demolished my executive functioning and ability to focus. I was also largely unmedicated because I was waiting for my insurance to kick in so I could finally get back on my medication full time.

I wasn't even given a chance.... despite my 10+ years of experience.....

Worst part is they provided me with employee housing which they booted me out of rendering me homeless. :( And when I tell you there is NO housing out here, NONE.... I'm talking extremely lucky to find a 2 bedroom for $3500-4000. I don't know anyone, no friends or family. No girlfriend or wife.

I am keeping my chin up but it's hard not to feel like a fucking loser. Like a joke. I take a chance to better my life and immediately fuck it up. I don't know why I even try. Nothing I do is good enough for other people. I just look stupid, lazy and careless to them.

22,"All we do is try, try, try.","Newly diagnosed 40 yr old woman with ADHD here. I just wanted to share what the psych who did my dx told me. 

""Something that strikes me about adults with ADHD is that every single one of them has spent their whole life trying. Trying, trying, trying, and failing a lot of the time. But they pick themselves up and do it again the next day. 

And because of that, they are almost always incredibly compassionate people. Because they know what it is like to try and fail. And they see when other people are trying too"".

And this... 
""Adults with ADHD are almost always very intelligent, but also very humble about their intelligence, because they have never been able to use it in a competitive way"".

And then went on to tell me all the advantages of my ""amazing, pattern-based instead of detail-based brain"".
