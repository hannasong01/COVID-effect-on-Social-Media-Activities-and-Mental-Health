16,I'm tired of 'bipolar' being used to describe shitty people,"Lately, on subreddits like /relationship_advice, people have been trying to justify their friends/family's/significant others shit behavior or abuse by saying ""but I think they're Bipolar"". I'm at a point where it's emotionally exhausting. 
Every time I discuss having the diagnosis people genuinely see me differently, expect me to be a horrible person, anticipate verbal or emotional abuse and general disrespect.

25,Being told I'm high functioning is not comforting,"My therapist likes to tell me about famous bipolar people and other patients of hers that are so much worse off than me. It makes it feel like she and no else understands how fucking hard it is to drive to work in a depressive episode without purposefully crashing my car or to not quit my job in a manic episode and go live in a treehouse with a harem of strange men selling drugs for a living. I'm grateful that even at my worst with psychosis, I'm still of sound enough mind to not do that stuff as much as I convince myself that's the only way to be happy and be myself, but it's STILL not comforting to hear that those thought patterns ""aren't that bad"".  

Just a small rant I had to get out. Shout out to my fellow high functionals.

EDIT TO ADD thanks for sharing all your own experiences. My therapist absolutely does not say things like this maliciously, it's just a thing I think a lot of people thinks sounds comforting. Imagine saying ""Think of how lucky you are! It could be so much worse!"" to someone who just lost a toe to diabetes. Of course they're glad they didn't lose a whole leg, but it also sucks a lot to lose a toe. Inner peace is my lost toe. Anyway, this therapist doesn't know much about bipolar, so I am going back to the drawing board in the near future to find someone I relate to a little more as far as the darker goings on in my head.

10,The worst part about bipolar that nobody talks about,"The worst part is not the mood swings or the violent intrusive thoughts that make Saw look like a romantic comedy. It is not the hypersexuality or the inability to sleep or the reckless behaviour. It is not even the suicidal and self-destructive urges that tell you that it's all hopeless so just give up.

The worst part is never truly knowing who you are. I look back at myself (text messages, Facebook messages, memories if I have any) when I was in an episode (depressive or manic) and I literally don't recognise that person. I find myself saying ""Am I really like that? Who is that person?""

Combine that with the dissociation (not being in my own body for the majority of the time) and I don't feel like I know myself or ever will. Does anyone else get this or is it just me?",gr8vff,1013,1.0,294,2020-05-27 00:09:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/gr8vff/the_worst_part_about_bipolar_that_nobody_talks/,False,False,2020,5

I’m so grateful for the doctors who have been working with me to get here, and my family for dealing with my previously unstable mood! I didn’t want to post anything on personal social media about it, because I know grades were a previous trigger for me, so I posted it here, because I know you guys know what hard work it takes! I’m just very excited right now :)

0,"A lot of bipolar people are stable, you just don’t hear from us.","I’ve been trying to get stable for six years and finally found Seroquel in 2019. It completely changed my life. 

I don’t really visit this subreddit that much because I really have no questions to ask. I’m doing really well so my mind is on other things and any bipolar-related issues I have, I have plenty of experience now and know pretty well what to do. So you don’t hear from me at all.

I just wanted to say that it’s important to realize that many people are like me. Scrolling through posts, it may seem like a horrific prognosis and endless problems, but in reality, *only those who need support post here*. The people who are stable don’t typically regularly browse Internet forums so there is really zero representation of people like me.

I have a few different diagnoses and it can seem like life is hell, based on the Internet forums. The majority of subreddit forum members are seeking support because they are having a difficult time. Those that are stable and well managed don’t post because they are off living their life and don’t need advice.
