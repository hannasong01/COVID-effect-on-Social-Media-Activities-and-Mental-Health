5,I think this should be a safe space again.,"I used to love browsing this subreddit. Part as to why that was is because I considered this place to be a safe space. People here could talk about their delusions, free of worry, while simultaneously not worrying about their delusions being affirmed/reinforced. I feel that's changed. 

Lately, every time I jump on this subreddit, just to see what's up, I find a lot of delusional posts, which is completely okay mind you - that's something we're all dealing with. But then in the replies people often, if not always (depending on the self-post itself,) affirm those delusions. That is absolutely wrong and shouldn't be happening. I understand that schizophrenia is super difficult, I'm going through it myself. But we need to be voices of reason in order to improve each other and be better, healthier individuals. It's okay to be delusional, but as stated in the literal rules of this sub, it's not okay to reinforce delusions. That's been happening too often lately. 

I vividly remember posting about a year and a half ago that I may believe my schizophrenia was a gift. I stayed at one upvote, and got a few private messages checking up on me to see if I was okay. THAT'S what I mean. The ""voice of reason,"" aspect of this subreddit is nearly gone. it's been replaced by multiple voices practically saying that delusions are okay and reinforcing them. I don't think that's cool, at all. 

We need to be better. Let's try to improve upon ourselves. If you see the world from a factual standpoint, share your opinion, it's really needed.

I'm probably being a bummer, but I really felt the need to share this. I find zero pleasure from this subreddit nowadays other than the occasional post, and I didn't quite understand why until now.

If you're not familiar, r/ShowerOrange is simple. Eat an orange in the shower... but you have to eat it like an apple, no wedges. (Yes, peel it first) I've been intrigued for a while but I tried it on a whim because it was time.

It helped me because I have problems getting in, the temperature chance, the liquid, it's a lot of stimulus. But the orange became my only concern, and it helped to have a fun distraction while my body was acclimating. Oranges are a strong aromatic too, giving the whole thing a spa type smell even with my disabled sniffer.

0,"""You don't look like you have schizophrenia.""","I don't look like I have schizophrenia, but I stay silent in fear that I will say something inappropriate, or have a word salad fall out of my mouth. You percieve this as shyness.

You may not be able to tell, but under my clothes are strategically placed scars, the blade scores my skin in places you will never see. You percieve the way I dress as modesty.

I don't shower or change for a week on end. And when I leave the house, my significant other often has to tell me I am wearing something inside out or backwards. Sometimes it takes me a couple of tries, and you see only the end result.

I don't seem like I have schizophrenia, but when in mixed company, I will take excessive trips to the bathroom, just for a moment of silence, because things are a bit too loud. You see someone with an over-active bladder. 

I don't seem like I have schizophrenia, because the whole world would fear me if I did. And when I DO act out of character, because my mask has become too heavy, you are shocked. You perceive this as selfishness, toxicity, or childlike.
