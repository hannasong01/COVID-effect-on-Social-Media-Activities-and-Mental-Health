6,My 17yo lovebug doesn't remember me anymore,"So my cat apparently got alzheimers and it's breaking my heart...

It's like he seized to exist, wiped out his hard drive.. I got him when I was 14yo, my cousin gave him to me, when she learned I had a hard time because my mom had cancer and also breaking up with my father. My life was in pieces... But my cat, he mended my heart. He gave me love and support when no one else did. He was there for me, always, no matter my mood, and I loved him so so much... Now he is gone, but his physical self is there, but none of his personality, he stopped doing all the things that was him, he is only existing atm, doing all the necessary things like eat, drink, sleep, poo... But not making contact with me, not cuddling, not meowing. I look into his eyes and I don't see him there anymore..

10,I'm a 13 year old boy who is abused and need help,"I'm 13 years old and I live with my dad. I'm shared custody from my mom to my dad. My dad is very abusive towards me. I've been diagnosed with depression and PTSD and I've gone to the hospital twice over suicide attempts because every time I'm with my dad I want to kill myself. He pushes me to the limit and I'm afraid that. 

Ever since I was  little, my dad has always beaten me with a belt. Even before I was old enough for school. My dad has beaten me for not doing what I was told to do. He yells curse words at me and uses my mother as an example of what not to be. And that makes me feel sad because I miss my mom. Recently, my grades dropped. I've been having problems at school. I have a hard time focusing and paying attention to what I'm being taught. My dad was pissed. One moment he’s screaming at me and cursing me out and telling me I won't achieve anything in life. And telling me I'm going to regret it when he’s done with me.

My 11 year old brother also made a bad grade, so he walked into my brothers room and I heard screaming and loud sound from my dad hitting him with a belt. Then he walked up to me and told me to give him my hand. I held my hand out and he hit me extremely hard with the belt. I screamed and held my hand, but he told me to hold my hand out again he continue to do it over and over again.

Then he told both of us to come in the kitchen. He started yelling at us saying he was in an ""ass whooping mood"" and that he'd beat us whenever we felt like it. That if we didn't care about our grades he wouldn't care either. That he'd make us feel his pain. He hit me extremely hard. My hand was red and swollen. I had a bruise on my wrist that was slightly swollen and stung to the touch. He told me to hurry and wash the dishes before he'd do it again. And he did. But my hand hurt too badly. He threatened to hold me down.

I'm going to kill myself if I have to continue to live with him. I cannot take this anymore and no one will do anything about it, I decided that when I go back to my mom's on Sunday I am refusing to go back to my dad's. This is what it's come to because he refuses to cooperate and my mom doesn't have enough money to get a lawyer and free legal aid takes too long. So I am not going. I know my dad will call the police if I don't go. When they come, I will talk to them and tell them my situation.

Can they force me to go? What will they do? Because in order to get me to go they would have to physically drag me. I am in fear of my life and I don't want to die but he just pushes me to that limit so I just can't be around him. I don't know how many times I've tried to tell my dad this and even my therapists have tried to tell him this.

He doesn't care, he simply denies treating me the way he does saying he's never called me the things he does on a daily basis like dumbass, idiot, son of a b\*\*\*, and he even calls my brother those things and denies it. Then when we're in public or around other people he acts like a totally sweet person, and his girlfriend thinks that I'm the problem because he constantly complains about me when really it's just a big show.

What will the cops do about it when they come?",fmfemk,1889,0.99,179,2020-03-21 14:01:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fmfemk/im_a_13_year_old_boy_who_is_abused_and_need_help/,False,False,2020,3

12,I don’t want to kill myself but I don’t want to live.,"I’ve been feeling like this for about the past week or so now, and it’s been really bothering me. Ive been depressed for about a year or so and it’s getting worse. I don’t want to live, but I don’t want to die. I feel like I’m stuck in a quasisuicidal state.I keep having the thought of just pressing a button that would just instantly take me out of existence. I fantasize about being asleep forever. I feel like I haven’t been myself for years. I feel like I haven’t been able to think straight and I’m constantly worried about tons of shit, but I don’t have enough motivation to do anything.

13,"I hate it so much when you try and express your feelings to your parents, but they turn it around and compare your suffering with theirs.","I've been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job, I'm a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown. Working there has been pretty easy, but I wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering I don't really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much.

So just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. 

At that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. 

And even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours, then escalates into a more ""This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel"" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care. 

Thanks for reading, I hope you feel better soon and find the key to unlocking your next set of happiness. Along with having a parent who doesn't make your suffering all about them and why you shouldn't be depressed.",fedwbi,1758,1.0,75,2020-03-06 14:04:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fedwbi/i_hate_it_so_much_when_you_try_and_express_your/,False,False,2020,3
14,"Have you ever seen your friends smile and thought ""Yeah they are better off without me*?","I'll start by saying this : Under no circumstances have my friends ever treated me poorly.

It's been a while since that happened. The bell rang and the break began. So I went to find them and when I did they were laughing so hard (I was in my very lows that day), I felt so nice for them and at the same time I thought ""I can't offer them that"". Before we went back to the classes, I let them walk infront of me because I didn't feel like being 100% in the mood and just by looking at them I kept thinking how great they are together.
Now today I saw some Insta stories of them staying at the house of the one I am closest to and it kinda hit me again. I hope I am not just jealous. It's just that at points I feel like I annoy them when they give me no reason to believe that.

I always tell jokes and laugh and 90% of the time they won't even notice the state of me because of how well I hide it. I love them, yet I am sure they deserve someone who is not like me.  Especially the one I am or used to (yes I am insecure) be closest to. She deserves the world and she's always been there for me but I can't keep being a burden to someone so kind, whom I love so much. I just feel like they ""clicked"" so much better and even though on one hand it kinda hurts on the other it is nice to see them like that. Especially when the other one got hurt by her once best friend. 
Anyway thanks for reading... What about you?

15,I have constant passive suicidal thoughts,"Recently I think I’ve been okay. Not super happy, but not completely down in the dumps, but ever since about a week ago, I’ve been getting passive suicidal thoughts. If you don’t know what that is, it’s when you think about suicide but have no actual plan or motive to do it. This has happened every day. Even this morning, my first thought when getting out of bed was “I should just die” These thoughts get annoying as it demotivates me from what I have to do during the day, which makes me feel useless, which makes me think about suicide.

16,"being called lazy, useless, and internet addict is a daily routine for me.","before, i had thought that if i told my parents about my depression they would be very supportive and instead feel that it is their fault that i turned out this way.

I was wrong.

My dad constantly asks me why am i always playing games all day, reading ""stupid, useless novels"", and refusing to go to school.

Mu grandma, keeps bothering me and lecturing me about how my phone will turn me blind because i look at it everyday.

My sister always scolds me for being so clumsy and disorderly with my stuff.

My mum is dealing with my dad's manic episode and my sister's upcoming national exam. She doesn't have time to deal with me.

They all know I am depressed. And they chose to ignore that fact and treat me like the depression is all ""in your head"".

I use my phone and games as an escapism. I need to distract myself so I won't constantly think abiut depression.

I am so tired of being called lazy. If I had some more energy to get up and do the stuff I like, I would do it. But everyday I feel like my body is deteriorating, and i am slowly sinking without anything to hold onto.

School's not any better. All of my classmates are nice but I just...can't handle the socializing. I hate being contacted. And I can't get anything into my head. I feel like my brain function is shutting down.

I used to be so good. Kind to others, excelled my studies, can connect with anyone.

22,I feel beyond suicidal,"Anybody else have this? Suicide just feels completely pointless. Infact, everything does. People try to cheer you up and all they do is tell you to ""be practical"" and to ""stop being dramatic"" when you're not even showing any emotion the first place and all you're doing is lying there like a dead fish. Killing yourself is just another desperate solution to something that can't be fixed and even then suicide doesn't do anything except cause more pain to people. Not even dying seems appealing anymore. At this point I just want to lie in bed and sleep. And keep sleeping. And keep sleeping. But I can't even be afforded the option of giving up. If I do, people tell me I'm selfish and stick pitchforks in me. I ask why and the best answer I get for ""keeping going"" is just ""because you have to."" and then people get angry when you press them further because they can't really think of a reason either. It's just a blind desperation to survive we all have, like we're just that important. That need to survive other people have seems to have disappeared from me, and so has the need to die. I'm stuck here in this place and all I want to do is block it all out. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed to piss. We keep going because we have to. But nobody ever tells me why.

25,"You ever get asked the ""where do you see yourself in five years?"" question in a job interview or something and have to stutter because ""probably not alive"" is the knee-jerk response?","First off, what a stupid fucking question to ask anyway.  What do you want to hear as the interviewer when you ask that question?  That I'm indifferent and stagnant enough to stay with your company that long assuming you hire me or that I'm ambitiously arrogant enough to in five years plan on being well passed this shit?  Fuckin' hell, man.

Undoubtedly there are varying degrees of suicidality just as there are reasons for doing it, all depends on the person.  I suppose I'm the sloth suicidal.  I've tip-toed through and around depression for the better part of my conscious life and I can't help but feel miserable an overwhelming percentage of the time.  Yet, when the obvious solution to this conundrum of despising being alive is ""well, don't be alive anymore"", the meddling safeguards of thinking about the wake of my actions swelling over everything and everyone I leave behind effectively whiteout any sort of blueprint I have for seeing myself out of my life.  Sounds rather counter-intuitive, but I'd rather my last thoughts be more ""you gave it a go, you're not doing anything wrong, you do you, kiddo"" and less ""hey, you're a tremendous asshole for this, I hope you know that.""

I can comfortably say I'm not doing it tonight, or tomorrow, or this year or even the next, but I genuinely feel like that's how I'm going out pending the absence of a freak car crash or lightning strike or some shit.

Don't even really know what I'm trying to say here, but do you ever feel like this?  Like life is essentially an existential clusterfuck that you want no part of, but for whatever fucking reason just can't make any sort of move?

Afterthought:  can't help but laugh that when driveling on in this post I look up at the browser tab and it says 'Submit to depression'

I took 6 pills but what I didn’t tell them that I kept slipping myself more. I knew I wouldn’t die but I wanted to come close— I wanted to know if death was truly what I wanted and if I got it I suppose my choice would’ve been made either way.

My first thought when things make me upset is I don’t want to live. I don’t like being this way anymore. I just want to be perfect or at least less insecure. I don’t like sharing these feelings to people, but I want someone to understand.

4,"I’m 19, my girlfriend was murdered, the trial is soon and I’m getting more and more depressive","Hi y’all,
Well I'm not used to posting on forums but I feel so bad atm and I can't open up about this to my family, my friends or my therapist even if they want that, I feel completely unable to talk about it with them.
I’m a 20yo man. I‘m Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since.
I grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I’ll call her Honey in this post.
 So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her.
When I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to « flirt ». Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren’t as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy.  She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually.
We kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it’s so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more « serious » (important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn’t agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other.
Then when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it’s unusual.
But we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her.  We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda  that cliché of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I‘d have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life.
We graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn’t the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy.
When I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no : since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way.
We were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn’t stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence.  She was a very funny person as well.  She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I’d even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate : when she did something she put her whole heart into it.  She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that.  But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence.  I’ve never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter.  My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me.  She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again.
Everyone loved her, literally.  She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people.  She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive.
I felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I‘m not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world.
We were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it’d have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved.  But I cannot bear what happened.
We were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will  disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way.  No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it’s extremely harsh.
It was a Sunday and we were at our parents’ for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together.
On Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents’ and me at mine, there wasn’t even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more.  It’s absurd : I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I‘d never forgive myself.
It’s an ongoing case so I’m not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn’t have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine).
I cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout.
Since I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn’t prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I‘ll fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown.  But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either.
I haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the  person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this.
I feel even worse since I know who did this and what their ""reasons"" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey.
Her parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it’s because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her.
People tell me that one day when I’ll be happy again and I‘ll meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it’s wrong, first I‘ll never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it’s unbearable to survive since she‘s no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn’t now that I‘m desperate without her that I‘ll want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she‘ll never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I’m « relieved » that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day.
Just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don’t see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very « strong » and now I‘m extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they‘re also embarrassed not to know what to tell me.
The only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it's very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don't know what to do with me anymore. But I don't know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I‘ll go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more).
I’m not afraid of the judgement, I know they‘ll have a long sentence but I‘m very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they‘re going to say, I‘m anxious I cannot bear it.  For the moment I’m trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn’t want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it’s, when I’m there I feel calmer.
I feel like nothing can ever ease my pain, I don't even know why I came to tell my story here. I just needed to open up and I can't do it with my loved one. I don’t think anyone will have read this anyway.",g8eq07,2351,0.98,143,2020-04-26 13:55:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g8eq07/im_19_my_girlfriend_was_murdered_the_trial_is/,False,False,2020,4
5,Perhaps what's worse than depression is not being able to realize if you're having the best time of your life or the worst because it all feels the same.,"I'm having a really hard time keeping up with life, especially since the lockdown started. I just don't feel like I have anything to live for. I *do not* want to be happy. I just don't understand what happiness is to be completely honest. That is not to say that I'm unhappy and miserable, what I'm saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. I just can't separate the two. On top of that, there's this feeling of guilt I keep having about everything. I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I'm this 21 year old uni student. And I've been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I've always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I've become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again. That's not to say I'm suicidal. I am *not*. I just like having those kinds of imaginations. The only thing I do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that I listen to music. Even my genres are New Age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. Now I'm not going too much into that stuff, but I hope I've made my point clear. I'm not looking for concrete advice. Perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post.

7,Does anyone else feel like being depressed is just part of them? and its something that they will never be able to change about themselves or 'cure'?,"I literally cannot remember a time in my life where I wasn't angry or unhappy with myself or how people treated me. I've had body issues since I was 8 years old because my grandparents overfed me and let me eat sweets all day, which led to me being outcasted by my peers and constantly criticised by my parents. I first started thinking about suicide when I was maybe 12 or 13 and 10 years later I still think about it. I don't think I've ever has a solid year of my life where I've thought that everything was going to be okay and life was worth living. I've had months of temporary relief from the constant pain, but thats all they were; temporary. I thought finding someone to spend my life with and who loves me unconditionally and puts up with my suicidal tantrums would fix me but it hasn't. I thought effectively curing my disfiguring autoimmune disease would help me have a new lease on life, but it hasn't. I have lots of friends, an attractive face, and I had a job I liked. No body in my personal life except for two people know that I struggle, and the rest would never guess it. I have nothing to be sad about, really, I have an objectively easy life. But that doesn't matter, I am depressed and I always will be. I could have the perfect body, my dream job, have millions in my bank account and I'd still feel exhausted. In the same way that people say 'once an addict, always an addict', I've come to believe the same thing about my depression.",fvcm3g,1975,1.0,104,2020-04-05 11:49:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fvcm3g/does_anyone_else_feel_like_being_depressed_is/,False,False,2020,4

Half an hour later, my father calls me and told me to come to the hospital.

It turns out, my mother (who had been fighting cancer for almost a year) stopped breathing. A couple hours later, she dies.

I didn't feel bad about it for a while, but now, been isolated i feel really lonely, sad and heartbroken. i have no one to talk to about this. Also, i now find it difficult to connect to other women because of trust issues.

10,My dad told me stop being depressed because it's embarrassing him.,"Last year On November 21 I attempted to kill myself and winded up in hospital the next day , I was still drowsy from the pills I overdosed on and could barely see let alone hear a thing .
 I was so weak I couldn't even walk , I had to use a wheelchair, I went to the hospital bathroom (still in the drowsy state ) and came back to find both my parents sitting by my hospital bed .

Keep in mind my mom is a single mom and has been raising me for years now , I only saw my day once and at most 5 times a year so I was not expecting him . I got to the bed , sat down and my mom gave me a very worried and concerned look but befire she could say anything my dad open his mouth ...

His exact words were , ""Stop being depressed,  it's embarrassing me and I don't want to deal with your nonsense ."" 
That broke my heart , I knew he didn't care but I didn't think it was that bad , I was still in my drowsy state but the moment he said that I think I might be woken up a little . The rest of the conversation with them was a blur but I just remember being so fixated on what he said to me .

That was the last time we spoke , he didn't even wish me a happy birthday this year . I'm only 14 , he broke what little hope I had of us finally reuniting as daughter and dad , I didn't have alot of hope to begin with but damn.


Edit : Thanks for all the positive comments .I didn't the the post would get as much attention as it did with that being said  I'm thankful , you guys were so nice and supportive in the comments .

12,Casually Suicidal,"Do you ever look at yourself in the mirror and think about death? You think about the consequences of it and what people's views are on it. Maybe you have even considered suicide. You brush it off, most likely. That is what most people do. People are scared. I am scared. Who would actually want to die though, right? This is what casually being suicidal is. Can you have suicidal thoughts and want to die at the same time? I have a fear of death. I always have, always will. How is it that some days I want everything to end, but I don’t at the same time? It's my biggest fear but also my biggest relief, my biggest wish. In reality, I just want the pain to stop. Why is everything so difficult? Sure, you would tell me to go get therapy, go get tested by a psychologist or something. As if that advice means anything. You want to label us, as if everyone feels the same thing, people like this are the same. In some ways, sure, they are. But most people don’t want to die, they want it to stop. What, exactly, do they want to stop? People. People are predictable. What other reasons are there for someone to want to go as far as think these awful thoughts? Even good people turn bad. Everyone is bad. Even me. People tell you to talk to others about these feelings, that it will help. But only people who experience these kinds of thoughts would understand, and even then it would give them this negative thing to relate to. Is that really a good thing? To relate, in wanting to die? Back to my point, what can people do? I can’t call myself depressed, because I’m not sad all the time. I can’t say I have anxiety, because I’m not anxious all the time. It goes on. The point of this paragraph is to say, don’t tell people to ask for advice, or say that you understand what they are going through. I always tell people what I’m going through, they brush it off. Talking about it can help. But only for the right people. For people like me, I don’t exactly know if I have specific mental health to blame everything on. I’m just feeling like this, that’s all.

For all the comments, I'm sorry I can't reply to them all but I will try to when I get round to it. But I want to say this now for anyone who will be reading in the future, please feel free to pm me. I'll always reply. Didn't realise this would blow up, but it is nice to know people feel the same way. I hope you find some sort of comfort in that as I do. Stay safe.

17,"I'm a lazy, pitiful 35 year old man child that never amounted to anything in his life, in debt, no degree, lives with his mom and can never follow through on anything.","Title says it all. My girlfriend broke up with me recently. She said I was a man child and she needed an actual man.

I'm old now. I look back and I don't remember ever growing up. I have 2 DWIs, an entry level job still, no college degree and I live at my mom's house with her fiance who I can't stand.

Any money I make I either spend it on video games or shopping and I racked up over $30k in debt.

I don't have a point or goal in my life and I feel like I'm already dying. 

I could have been something good in my life but here I am alone again. Every single woman I've been with has left me. 

I can't fucking sustain or follow through with anything. I didn't get a degree, I don't finish the projects I start, every idea I've had has never completeled, I've never fit in socially and at the time of writing this post, I don't see any real will to live.

I'd never kill myself because the people that do care about me would be hurt and I care about them way too much to hurt them, so instead I'm just floating through life, barely surviving, with no retirement, I'll probably die while still working as an old man.

I'm a pitiful 35 year old man and I just wanted to let everyone know. I don't have any reason to move forward and even if I did, I'd never follow through with it anyway.

19,I hate that nobody can understand what trauma does to you,"And this compounds the depression.

Not only is childhood trauma (one in which your parents - who *should* have represented all that was good - were in fact, evil) one of the worst possible causes of depression - but the fact that nobody gives two shits other than telling you ""get over it,"" or ""seek help."" 

As if trauma is expected, but not ignoring it is not expected. You're supposed to conform to this place; to accept trauma as normal, if not something you *do*, normally.

And so you get even more depressed about the fact that nobody understands what it's like to be depressed.",g2c8pv,1295,0.99,107,2020-04-16 10:10:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g2c8pv/i_hate_that_nobody_can_understand_what_trauma/,False,False,2020,4

23,Annus Horribilus,"Today is the anniversary of my daughter's death. She died in my arms, and I am grateful I could be with her. She was 25, and we were very close; cut from the same cloth.
She had long suffered depression and social anxiety which manifested in anorexia and alcoholism, creating 'the perfect storm' that resulted in her death. She made no secret of her desire to die, but her death wasn't suicide, per se.
In the year prior to her passing I was diagnosed with esophegal cancer, and spent a lot of time in hospital getting treatment. Nobody expected me to live, and I think this hit my daughter especially hard as she was very emotionally dependent on me.
During my time in hospital my ex wife, my daughter's mother, came to stay with my daughter to care for her. I've since discovered, from reading my daughter's reddit, emails and texts, that her mother was drink and abusive the whole time.
I demanded to be released from hospital early, as my daughter's health had deteriorated, and they made arrangements to get me home. I was unable to speak in more than a whisper, had no esophegas and was fed through a tube in my stomach but I was happy to be home with my daughter. We spent quality time together.
When she died a few weeks later I arranged the funeral and the wake. I couldn't deliver a eulogy, or even toast her life.
My daughter had very few friends, partly because of her treatment resistant depression, and partly because she just didn't suffer fools lightly. But the friends she did have she treated like gold. One was hospitalised after a failed suicide attempt, and my daughter drove 400 kms to visit him, and she went back every day for days on end, just as example. None of them could manage to get to her funeral.
I have recovered, mostly, now. But I don't know why. I don't want to live. Especially after this past year.
I am posting this not out of self pity but as a belated eulogy to my very, very special daughter. Without her the world is black and white and devoid of happiness.",g41t6v,1077,0.99,49,2020-04-19 04:50:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g41t6v/annus_horribilus/,False,False,2020,4

4,I hate how fast I go from being okay to empty and depressed,"I was doing fine this past month, I’ve been getting up early and being productive and just being okay for once. I started talking to this girl and things were perfect, we have lots in common and we seem to be on the same boat on things. I haven’t been in a relationship in a while but she made it clear she wants to be with me in time. Yesterday I invited her to hang out with my friends and I and she was just so different than she is when we’re alone. When I tried to hold her hand she didn’t let me. Afterwards she texted me and said she’s not ready after all and realized it when I tried to show affection in front of my friends. We’ve only been talking for about 2 weeks so it didn’t completely destroy me, but I just always get attached quick so I’m still upset about it. It seems like every person I see myself with always tends to end things for one reason or another and I’m over it. 

Being a front line worker is exhausting as it is, but having a failed “almost relationship” again is messing with my head and I’m starting to feel the darkness overwhelm my thoughts when I’ve spent the majority of the last few years working on fixing that. It’s hard when I put all my effort into people that don’t do the same back. You know when you stare into nothing and start overthinking everything about your life? I’m starting to think I’m the problem behind all these failed relationships. I know she’s not worth it, I don’t think it’s her specifically making me feel this way as much as the patterns that keep occurring in my love life. I don’t know what to do anymore.

Edit (05/24/2020): I did read all the comments, thank you. This thought of regrets have tortured me so much: a simple choice a decade ago still haunts me today and looms over me. In the past two weeks, wrestling my inner demons, I lost so much weight and have lost so much mental curiosity and interest I used to possess. But recently, after watching Being Erica as some of you recommended, I realized that ""no matter where you run, you just end up running into yourself."" I suppose regrets will come in different forms, no matter what I do or try, the outcome would be the same that I'd be short of what I desire to be. To be honest, I don't know what a solution could be here, but I suppose seeking it is part of that endless struggle.

15,My sister saved my life yesterday.,"There I was minutes away from grabbing my gun, about to walk in the woods and end it. Was actually starting to feel pretty good about that too. Not having to hate myself, going through life everyday while nothing seems to make me happy anymore. Then my younger sister gave me a rock she painted for me. Blue with a guitar on it, and a moon with stars in the middle of the guitar. It said made in 2020, Love Nikole. I almost cried in front of her which is something she's never seen me do. It just hit me so hard, like beyond words. My family is very loving but they mostly keep to themselves. I just thought to myself, how could I put her and everyone else through such a thing. Spent half the night crying like a little girl, I'm 34M. Still woke up feeling like garbage, but I dunno somethings different, I guess that feeling like someone's thinking of me is helping a bit. I can't say anything to her now but in the future I'm really gonna thank her for that. I still feel like I don't wanna be here, but whereas before it was 100%, now I'm slightly on the fence about it. Hopefully this is a little inspiration for those out there thinking like me. I should probably reach out to her but things like that are so hard for me, plus then the whole family would know. Thats why i like coming here.

0,"I'm black, I'm scared, tired and I'm at the end of my rope with life.","Jesus, how do I even start. As you could read by the title, I'm a black man. I've always been in the fight. Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way.

The kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of ""you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there"", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards.

I've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human.

And with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly.

I wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore.

Edit: all of this support... I'm very, very thankful for it. I think I've never felt this supported in my whole life. All of your words have touched me deeply. I'm so glad you helped me. I feel more hopeful, more energized from talking to you all. Thank you. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. You've all stopped me from doing something terrible today. Thank you.

Edit 2: wow, I was not expecting this kind of response from so many people. I'm trying to respond to everyone, but I think I can't. I'd like to thank you all once more for all your words. I'm very glad that I vented about all these feelings here with you all. I feel so much support from you and I feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling. It may seem a bit dramatic, but I'm legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life. I never expected to see so many people I don't know just rush in to support me when I'm in my absolute worst. So thank you, once more for being here for me. I mean it.

I have few positive memories. Im tired and I dont want to do keep trying anymore. Everything ive tried never has worked. Meditation. CBT. Psychologists. Psychiatrists. Medication. Sleeping Pills. Weed.

I feel so young (because I havent literally done much at all with my depression+anxiety) but ancient at the same time. I have no passions, no interests. No goals. Havent had good friends in years. Virgin. I dont go out. I dont take photos, I dont use social media. I feel like I dont exist. I dont even have a fucking job now. Never had a boyfriend.

Literally the only thing Ive done is graduate university and I cant even get a fucking job.

Ive struggled in everything ive ever done. School. Hobbies. Uni. Work. Job Applications. Appearance.

The only time ive ever been hit on is at clubs. I just hate seeing other people my age succeed and do well in life. Even people who are 17-18, have had more experiences then me. I hardly go out. Ive spent 90% of time at home alone with my elderly parents. 

I try so hard, but Im still a loser and I hate it. Im not introverted and I just hate how my life has become. I hate it..I do. I feel like I must be such damaged goods that its too late to get better. These last 6 years in particular have flown and Im just so fucking done.

She loves us but she's very immature, toxic, physically abusive, mentally abusive, etc. She's sort of a horrible human being but in her mind, she has done all she can for us. She had me when she was 19, single mom, we don't talk to our dad. 

He's set on doing it again because my brother and I have an extremely close relationship and he doesn't want to be a burden on me. He has been failing school, hates my mom, and feels like if he kills himself, my life will become better because my mom will realize she is the problem. But my mom will never know that. He thinks I'll be sad for a couple of years but I'll get through it because I'm a strong person. He has told my boyfriend that he has bought 100 pills this time for his second attempt. 

My brother is the best. But my mom has fucked him up so much. He feels like he doesn't deserve my love and feels extremely guilty that I'll have to take care of him when I went through so much to get where I am. I just graduated with a masters degree and looking for a job on the west coast.

I also want to note there is a genetic component. On my mom's side, my grandpa, my uncle have killed themselves. My mom has attempted suicide when I was in high school by jumping off our apartment but survived. I have been depressed since age 7 but became healthy two years ago. My brother has felt this way since he was 10. I told him once I get a job I can take him away forever and help him get his life back on track but he doesn't want to burden me. 

What do I do? Has anyone been in a situation like this?",h88bej,1161,0.99,167,2020-06-13 14:14:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/h88bej/my_brother_plans_to_kill_himself_on_72/,False,False,2020,6
22,43 and completely lost,"I've never posted anything online before so I'll try to be succinct.  I'm 43 male, never married, no kids, on medical leave from my job for depression.  I'm so disappointed in the person I've become.  No matter how much I read or do, it's like I have not gained any wisdom on managing life's challenges.  I grew up in a loving home with lots of encouragement and high expectations.  I was an A student through college but my social skills have always been lacking.  I managed to work for the past 20 years, but I couldn't keep up in my current job, hence the medical leave.   

I've been in therapy for much of the past 10 years.  My psychologist believes I have traits of avoidant personality disorder.  I take several antidepressants and I'm currently two weeks into TMS therapy.  Nothing seems to help.  I'm unbelievably critical of myself.  Even now, as I write this message, I am certain that this will be the worst written message ever on Reddit.   I've been reading hundreds of other posts and they seem so well written.  I'm even more amazed by the responses.  How are you all able to find the words to share your wisdom and advice?  I read everything I can find on overcoming depression and avoiding suicide but it goes right through me and outv the other end with nothing retained.  I can't imagine giving advice to someone.  There is so little I can think of to say to people in distress.  

I'm a mess right now.  I have lost hope of getting better.  I don't exercise, I sleep 14 hours a day.  I have a house but I spend most nights at my parents.  Nothing traumatic has ever really happened to me.  The worst thing is that my ex-girlfriend cheated on me three years ago and I haven't dated since.  I have some solid friends that I've known since high school.  They are all very well adjusted and have careers and families of their own. 
I can't seem to learn anything these days.  I used to be smart but I am not longer able to learn new things.   I can't imagine surviving another 40 years.  I think about volunteering but I even tell myself that I have nothing valuable to offer.  I've no real skills to rely on.  I have saved about $300K in my 20 years of work. I had saved that money so that I could support having a family some day.  I no longer think I'm capable of having a family.  Too overwhelming.  I would be an awful spouse and father.
I don't plan to go back to work.  I plan to just live on my savings as long as I can and then end my life.  By then my parents will be gone and I won't hurt them.  My siblings and friends will be hurt in the near-term but they will be ok in the long run.  

I've read so much on coping with this disease.  But so little spurs me to action.  Until last year, I'm was microdosing with weed every morning to get myself going, keeping up with job and social occasions.  The weed stopped working for me though.  Now if I smoke, it gives me some paranoia that makes things worse.

12,Im begging somebody to read this I desperately need to feel like I have a friend there for me right now.,"Posting this on a few subs because I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve reached my breaking point. 


Im so tired. I’m so tired of existing. I’m so tired of being mad. I’m so tired of being tired. It’s pathetic. I’m a 25 year old adult who’s stuck living at home with my family. I can feel myself falling apart and I’m reaching the point where I’m finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life, or I’m going to end up cutting ties all together with my family, which is where I’ll probably sink. If it’s sink or swim out in the big world. 


I am holding on to so many grudges. From so many years. That I clearly can’t cope with in a healthy way. My heart hurts so much but I’m such a glutton for punishment that I can’t bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate. And it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive. I’ll try and use brackets to section off my thoughts since I doubt anybody cares enough to actually read this all the way through. 



 {My thoughts on my father}

{{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C’s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying “well Don’t choke him (insert name)” and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying “I’m not choking him” I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. 

But you know. Now that I’m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I’m going to get my ass beat I’m going to get my ass beat. I’m just not living in fear anymore. }}}}


 {my thoughts on my brother}

{{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I’m concerned we probably won’t ever speak again. Let’s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to “wake him up after rugrats” when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you’re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn’t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don’t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there’s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. 
When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he’s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse “isn’t this okay because it’s what dad used to do to us. “ of course having a criminal record he couldn’t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she’s gone it’ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it’s not full time and “at your age your brother worked full time” at my age y’all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It’s just never going to be good enough. 


Let me talk about our most recent altercation, because it’s a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I’m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it.  I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn’t want to help which wasn’t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded “forget it” and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother’s defense I’m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don’t want to do something. 

Get to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5:30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn’t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother.

Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn’t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn’t want to be around any of them. 


The next day comes and I don’t show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said “we don’t know if we’ll need you tomorrow or not yet” so I just didn’t bother to show up because if y’all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn’t going to show up.  My brother comes home through the door doesn’t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up “why should I have to explain to my boss why you didn’t come” “why do you get to sleep all day while we work I’m sick of it” turning to my mother “I’m sick of him aren’t y’all sick of him” (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won’t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I’m running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I’m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don’t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset.

(A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn’t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn’t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said “well he wasn’t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.” I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I’m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She’s talking some I can’t I don’t have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn’t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan.  So obviously I’m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don’t know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn’t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) 

Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of “you’re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation” to which he responds (talking out of his ass) “well you didn’t pay for it mom did!” Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there’s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}}

This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. 

 {my thoughts on my mother}

{{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I’m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I’m literally holding onto grudges that I don’t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I’m positive she’s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. 

A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I’m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes “are you ready now I’m not in a rush or anything” I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I’ll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I’m ready to go lol. Otherwise I’d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she’s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I’m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It’s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I’m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of “you’re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me” my response being “oh what I’m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???” which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don’t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don’t care if they’re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I’m not mad and you tell me “yes you are mad that’s why you’re being shitty” that’s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you’re just going to decide I’m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I’m in a bad fucking mood then. 

So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying “I hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me”. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I’m inside of it, I hope it’s something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won’t be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn’t kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don’t care about context with my car history

(Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn’t at fault for but still it’s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day.  I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn’t want a new car which I will explain why later. )

And then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he’s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn’t literally crying “mommy bail me out” when he’s in there. As he’s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me “your ashtray is knocked over “ as if i wasn’t outside and heard him kick it over like I’m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of “if he needs an ashtray he’ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.” Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. “Well it is your ashtray...” okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that’s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. 

In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she’s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don’t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I’ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn’t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. 

My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don’t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don’t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I’m chasing my mother’s approval or some shit. }}}}



 {thoughts on my own disgusting self}

It’s only been recently that I’m starting to come around to my father and that’s only because I think I’m starting to hate my mother. 


I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I’ve been and all that I’ve been given. But I don’t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. 


And that’s not to say I’m perfect either. I’ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. 

When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that’s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. 

But as an adult I can see that’s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it’s just who you are and can’t be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn’t sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing “doctor” with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That’s fucking gross we were all kids. 


Fast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn’t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn’t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don’t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn’t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that’s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. 

That’s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn’t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. 

But here’s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I’m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I’ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn’t me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we’re so sorry don’t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) 

It wasn’t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn’t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That’s another one that’s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. 

But since the recent heart break I’ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I’m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. 

I’m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me.

I’m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don’t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don’t turn them into jokes. I’ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don’t want to be one anymore. 


I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. 



TLDR; I’m a scumbag. I’m starting to think my family is scumbags, and I’m genuinely losing my will to live. I’ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don’t know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow.",hzah5n,1841,0.99,119,2020-07-28 07:47:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hzah5n/im_begging_somebody_to_read_this_i_desperately/,False,False,2020,7

19,phrases im tired of hearing,"""it gets better"" 

for fleeting moments at best

""you are loved""

by who lmao? you, who doesn't even know my name? a stalker? 

""temporary problem""

well i guess this is techinally correct. no one lives forever

""theres so much to live for""

well maybe for you thats true, but for me who has  lost almost all motivation and ability to feel happiness its not relatable 

""what about your loved ones!""

okay thats just guilt trippy, and either way not everyone has loved ones/support systems just because you do janet 

""just exercise and drink water""

omg...thanks 🤩 /s

""what if something amazing and life changing happens that wouldn't if you died?""

yeah ive been carrying on that hope for years and here i am 

""just put yourself out there""

ive tried, so many times. part of the issue in the first place is that it usually never goes anywhere, and because of my mental health and abandonment issues people are usually driven away. also i completely lack the ability to maintain long term relationships, and have no idea what a healthy one is like in the first place. of course thats all assuming i cant get myself out of bed in the first place, find the social skills i dont have, and stop being an anxious little bitch. 

""god-""

shut up. i respect your religion but please shut the fuck up. 

""choose to be happy""

my ability to choose seems to be locked. should i put it in rice, turn it off and on?

""go to therapy""

sure, you paying?

20,Boyfriend finally succeeded in taking his life Sunday,"My boyfriend of 6 years suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, and OCD. I constantly would lurk on this subreddit looking for insight, hope, understanding...

He begged for death. He finally did it the day before his birthday. He left two teenage girls behind. They're devastated but their dad had pushed them out as far from him as possible months ago during this last episode of depression and anxiety. He was so afraid of them, he couldn't even speak to them on the phone. 

He sought out all types of help-- therapy, behavioral therapy, ketamine infusions, he got sober, exercised daily... We did it all together. For a while it worked. We had about 2 years of what could be called happiness. He still had depressive episodes in the wintertime but they dissolved by the late spring and early summer. This past winter he was so afraid of how bad it was getting... it didn't lift in the early spring and then COVID hit. He had dental issues come up. All OCD triggers. 

He would say to me ""if only it one just ONE thing... JUST my teeth or JUST COVID... maybe I could get through. I don't want to die""

I had to leave for the past few months to help my sister who has two young children while her husband is away in the military. She was leaving the kids home alone (oldest just turned 12) to go food shopping due to COVID. I was also offered an internship until October that I had spent the past year trying to get. I told him I would be back.

He wanted me to leave and stay at the same time. He had tried suicide several times before I left and my soul hurt so bad. Every time I looked at him it felt like I was looking at a ghost. We had him committed to a 10 day treatment facility but it didn't work. I knew there was a chance when I left that I would not see him again. He often told me he knew he was breaking my heart and soul and hated me around sometimes because he wasn't the person he used to be. We talked every single night while I was gone.  I told him since I was away it was okay to talk to me about anything because I could still get a break and had the energy to listen. I did not talk to him the past couple nights leading up to his death. I was with friends and family. I told him I would call him Sunday. He never answered

He was suffering so much. I hope that he is in a better place. Anywhere would be better than here. I just wish I picked up the phone the last night he called. I wish I picked up the phone for the very last time and I could have said I love you. This has been the worst year of my life.

22,I have lost my empathy.,"Before my depression, there was warmth and curiosity in my personality. When people I cared about told me their stories I listened and felt happy for them. When I saw a family member struggling I would feel compassion for them and I would do what I could to help them. 


I seem to have lost this. When someone tells me about themselves or their experiences, I don't care unless it affects me. Their stories are boring to listen to, even the closest life events. Engagements, marriages, accidents, ilness, none of it interests me. I feel extremely guilty over this and it's a big part of my illness. When I speak to someone, I feel intense anxiety and a bit of fear. It feels like the person speaking to me will get upset because I'm not enthustiastic or engaged in the conversation - as if they'll think I don't enjoy spending time with them and thus stop spending time with me. I'm afraid of losing them and being alone.


It's true, though - I don't enjoy spending time with them, which is part of why I feel so horrible in the first place. 
  

I know that the problem is me, not them. My friends and family are fantastic people and we've been very close in the past but when I think about my memories with them I feel nothing. I have avoided them for about 5 years because of this. I'll come to family gatherings when it's unavoidable, like Christmas, but every time I'm asked to come visit someone (or someone asks me if they can visit) I make up excuses.",hvunye,1232,1.0,106,2020-07-22 14:23:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hvunye/i_have_lost_my_empathy/,False,False,2020,7

2,"Life doesn't ""get better"" unless you take actions to MAKE it better. But depression itself can make it impossible to act","Exercise/physical activity, eating healthy, spending time in nature, finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to ""be good for your mental health""... but by definition, depression is a problem *precisely because* it inhibits your inability to function, much less do things that are good for you. Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can't bother to do any of it.

I went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn't know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that's why I'm sitting in your office right now and I don't know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*.

If people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn't need to classify it as an 'illness' or 'disorder'. That's why it's so infuriating when we see how even 'professional' mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which I cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation.

It's so irrational and frustrating that I'm physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk, but I have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed. Only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever, but then I just get sad and start spiralling from guilt. And I can't stop thinking about how irrational it is, even though I've experienced it for so many years. I'm constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence, as if I ever expected anything different.

More than hopelessness, I just feel confused as to what I'm supposed to do when I can't will myself to do anything. What even is this anymore?

4,Depression = Losing intelligence,"The worst part about depression for me, even worse than suicidal thoughts or constant pain, is the huge toll it has on my mental faculties. 

I think slower. I need longer for decision making and understanding pretty basic things in conversations. I can't plan anything because it is too much mental effort. I read a sentence in a book and don't register the information it's supposed to convey.

I can't think as deeply. As a teenager, I was able to hold my train of thought and look at a problem for a long time and find an intricate solution. That's gone. My ability to think any deeper than surface level is lost. 

I'm not improving my programming skills, even though I do it professionally on a daily basis. I just don't seem to have the mental capacity for improvement.

7,Being depressed and having depression are different.,"I have clinical depression. I was diagnosed about 5 years ago. It really hits me hard sometimes. One of my friends does not understand that people can 100% get depressed because of nothing. She thinks people only get depressed for a specific reason. Such as someone passing away, or a horrible break up. And those things are awful, those feelings are valid and the literal worst. But, she doesn’t understand that people can just be depressed for basically no reason at all. I’m currently having a depressive episode. Nothings wrong. I just can’t get out of bed... I can’t do the dishes. I can’t pick up the take-out off my bedroom floor. I can’t. 

I just.. I can’t hear the “but.. why are you depressed?” question one more time. Fortunately and unfortunately, I’ve been dealing with this illness for long enough that I know that this feeling will end, and I know how to somewhat manage it. But, if she were to say that to someone else.. I just worry that it could end someone’s life. 


Anyway, that’s all. I’m sure no one will even read this. K bye

I’m not looking for sympathy, just setting the stage.

I worked 14 to 16 hour days for 27 years trying to do what we needed done. Now, she says I’m lying about the problems. I’m on disability and can barely walk. She calls me lazy and stupid for not working when I really miss being productive. When my problems flare up and I can’t do things, she gets mad. She has now taken $900 that is mine. I’m at a loss.

And then I finally went to my husband and told him everything. The suicidal thoughts that have gotten worse over the past two weeks, that I think I'm experiencing delusions and paranoia, that I'm genuinely scared for my safety.

And all I really got was a ""we'll get through this"" and that was it. I mentioned possibly needing to go to the ER or look for an in-patient facility to get help because of how rapidly this was progressing and he told me ""but what if it financially ruins us? What then?"" And I just stopped. It's cheaper to bury me than it is to give a single fuck about me and help me get treatment. 

I did everything right. I fucking begged for help. But it's not that serious until you actually kill yourself and by then it's too fucking late.

*I have a therapist and psychiatrist. I've tried 20 plus meds with absolutely no benefit.

My dad died last week, on Friday actually. I have been trying to be so strong but it is so hard and I know he would be upset I’m needing this help but honestly I just need any supportive words. He was with his best friend and they got a call for a big contract (my dad and his roomate are electricians, my dad is 63 and retired but still helps his roomate our) my dad left the shop to go to the bank to pull out some money. He was 10 steps from the cross walk but he thought he could make it jay walking accross a 4 lane highway. The light was red and there was a big semi truck blocking the 2 lanes after the meridian. He tried to walk in between the semi and it’s trailer and the light turned green. I know all of you can imagine what happened next. I feel so fucked and so sad my dad has a good 15-20 years in him, he was healthy and happy. A little skinny from beer and coffee but he wasn’t no lazy old man. I have 3 brothers (27 year old,24 year old, 19 year old (me), and my little brother is 16.)
I just had a kid and I’m already so stressed about that cuz it was a little unexpected. And last my dad knew was it was going shitty and we were getting ready to go to court. I have been seeing him everyday since my son was born. I never even got a picture with my dad and my newly born son. Im also so worried about my mom because she gets like this over if she looses a pack of smokes. I don’t know how she is ever gonna be okay again. I don’t know if I’ll ever be okay. I just want to walk into my dads house hug him one more time laugh about anything. He always dropped whatever he was doing to help out family, no matter what. My mom and him were divorced for 20 years and when mental health kicked my moms butt and she couldn’t take care of my little brother and was about to go homeless my dad was there for her offering her his bed even after 20 years. I just keep rambling on because I really don’t even know how to end this I just don’t even know. I love you so much dad and I miss you. His favourite beer was Budweiser and I don’t drink beer so if anyone could pop a bud for my dad. Thank you. He also loved to fish. He was most happiest sitting on the lake with his boys fishing all day. I love my dad so much he was an asshole sometimes but that’s cuz he wanted what’s best for us and what dad isn’t an asshole sometimes. He never beat me or made me feel embarrassed he was always there. My youngest brother was even only my half brother but my dad called him his son, and my brother called him dad. I know my dad wasn’t a dumbass I fucking know that to the absolute top of anything. He just made a dumb idea. Must have been feeling 19 again. I love you so much dad. I’m gonna try everyday to be okay for you and to make sure mom will be okay.

In a moment of panic I slammed the door... right onto his head. Everyone in my family is telling me “it’s not your fault” and “it was a mistake”, but guess who always fucking makes mistakes? ME. And now my mistakes are causing the deaths of those I love. I hate myself so much I don’t even see the point of going on anymore.

Edit: Oh my god, thank you everyone! It’s been a really hard day and the support I’ve had from my family and you guys has helped a lot. It’s still an on going process, but I’m trying not to blame myself for it. Hearing your stories actually helped a lot, it let me know I wasn’t alone in this and that it is possible to move on.

My mom is sick (multiple sclerosis) and We can't afford her medication anymore. 


Depression, Fear and anxiety everyday. Our country is run by corrupted politicians who ruled for 30 years. No one is able to let them go (they have weapons) ... 

I've been unemployed for more than 1 year. 
My father is unemployed too. 

We did a revolution that survived for 5 months but since corona happened it turned off and not one politician was convicted. 

To make it easy to understand our situation , There is no dollars in our country anymore only lebanese money. All our savings in the banks is gone. We became poor. 70% unemployement , everything is expensive ... Imagine Vanezuella but ten times worse .. 

We are stuck in a war between Israel and Hezbollah. We are innocent educated people who speak 3 languages !! I have a license in physical therapy which I got and cost me 25 thousand dollars and it's useless. My father is an accountant who worked so hard and now our savings is gone! There is no fucking dollars anymore! 

I'm doing physiotherapy volunteer work but now it's starting to do more bad for my mental health than good. I'm working 8hours and getting payed 0. I'm angry every morning about this and specially before sleeping

I'm just done. I'm really lost and I can't get out of this country with no savings and if it wasn't for my parents I would have ended my life a long time ago.

20,I am the singer of a pretty well known band and I struggle with suicidal thoughts every day,"Hi everyone. Like I said in the title, I am the singer of a pretty well known (european) band. Before this year we had shows almost every other week. It's fun, rewarding, great in almost every aspect. When I am on stage I am unbeatable, unkillable. But as soon I get off, I rarley talk to my bandmates, try and avoid fans and get as drunk as I possibly can. I wouldn't say that I have a problem with alchohol since I rarely drink unless it's after a show or a special occasion. I currently live with my gf of 1(soon to be 2) years. I love her but I can't talk to her about my feelings. Whenever I try to be open with her I get cold feet and chicken out.

I suffer, like many of you, in silence. My life might seem pretty alright from the outside, but from the inside I just want to fucking die. My music is embodiment of my feelings, hatred, sadness. Sure that helps me vent but I cannot for the life of me escape myself.

I also have an evil circle hanging over my head. I need to feel this hatred and sadness and shit and bile in my soul to be able to write. If I feel happy, on the rare occasion, I can't write. And if I can't write, I can't perfom.. See my problem? I want to be the embodiment of my art. I want to experience this pain to be able to write and perform it. This comes at the price of wanting to die every single day. How can I escape or deal with my emotions, when I use them to make a living?

&#x200B;

Edit: I am moved by everyones effort to help. I can't do much to thank you but here is a poem that I wrote a while back. It won't rhyme in english but I hope that doesn't bother you.

&#x200B;

You hold the suns warmth in your hand

when you touch me I become your man

to be thawn is not easy

the cold bites and doesn't feel right

if you've been frozen for all these years

a layer of ice to cover the wounds

you melt my heart you melt my soul

unlocks life and a whole new world

I love you with all my power

even though I never told you

&#x200B;

with the sun's rays dawns a new day

but there was something you didn't want to say

for cold winds can troubble a flame

you wanted to tell but not to hurt

when the warmth had gotten so weak

you said that it was I who had ended the day

that the frost and ice had put out your flame

you left no please stay

for a sun needs fuel and a spark

a chill needs only a coffin",ive8e5,1597,0.98,132,2020-09-18 20:46:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ive8e5/i_am_the_singer_of_a_pretty_well_known_band_and_i/,False,False,2020,9

22,I finally went to see a psychiatrist and he straight up told me I don’t have a mental illness.,"I’m sorry if I sound mad and this is a rant, I’m fucking furious. 

So after 3 months of waiting, many years of putting all of this off, I finally get to see a psychiatrist. I drove 2 hours to get here, spent 20 bucks on parking, and I was told to fuck off. 

This guy could barely speak English, but all he talked about was how cannabis is bad and all my problems are from cannabis.  

I’ve been smoking daily for 2 years now, and Ill admit, it is a problem. But I’ve literally been dealing with mental health issues my whole life. 

He wouldn’t even let me speak and when I did he was just drawing on his notepad. He would just tell me that it’s cannabis and I need to go to rehab and once I stop smoking I’ll be fine. 

Bitch, I’m not fucking fine. 

There were so many things I needed to talk about, I literally think I have autism, and when I brought it up he didn’t even acknowledge it. I wanted to talk about anxiety issues and ADHD and ptsd, but apparently I have none of those and it’s just cannabis.  

My favourite part of the whole meeting was when he told me I just need a mom. I literally responded with, “well no shit, but my mom literally just died a few months ago so that’s not really an option.”

I’m so fucking pissed. My life is literally going to go no where and I’m never going to get help, so this is fucking fun.


Edit, thanks for all the support guys, I’ve got another doctors appointment set up to see a new psychiatrist so that’s cool.

31,I’m kinda disgusted with myself,"I have a depression nest. My bedroom is disgusting. I have a path from my door to my bed and that’s just about it. Everywhere else I have piles of clothes and old food containers and boxes and crap I don’t need. I have a hoarding problem on top of being too depressed to clean; my dad is a pack rat too so I’ve always spent my life in clutter. I don’t think it’s at TV show level but it’s still bad. Does anyone have tips/advice for finally cleaning up? I’ve been trying but honestly some days I pick up like 2 pieces of trash and toss a couple things in a laundry basket and I automatically feel drained.


I remember when my old roommate barged in to my room mistaking “I’m coming!” For “come in” I was always so careful about keeping roommates out of my room, always locking the door, because I was never more embarrassed. I saw the shock on her face as I rambled off reasons for the mess “I just dumped everything in here when I moved in, I’ve just been super busy with school and work has me exhausted” I know she didn’t buy it she must have thought I was the nastiest person alive, she asked if I wanted help but I declined and said I’d handle it. I never really did.


I can handle living in clutter. It’s all I’ve ever really known. I do wish I had a super cute and organized room but on the rare occasion I do try to organize everything it never lasts. But I feel so guilty. Guilty because I have a dog. He’s been my best bud for the last 15 years or so and he doesn’t deserve this life. Like I said we’ve always lived in a cluttered house but my room is the absolute worse. He gets fresh food and water and I try to take him outside often so there’s no accidents in here and he gets fresh air but he still does not deserve this. I know he walks around my piles of crap just fine and still runs full speed to see me when I walk through the door, his tail wagging so fast that his whole little body wiggles. I know he loves me and I love him with my entire heart. He’s one of the only things that keep me going because I’m afraid of what would happen to him if I were gone. I don’t think my family would be the best caretakers and I saw how the poor guy grieved when my mom died. I saw how he was confused and still went to her bedroom looking for her every single day for the longest time. When we’d pull up in the car he’d race to the passenger door and wait for her to come out. My family showed me how he kept finding his way into my room when I first left for college. I wouldn’t want to leave him hurt and confused like that so I keep pushing on. But I can’t let him keep living like this. 


I’m disgusted and deeply disappointed in myself but I’ll do my best to clean my room and throw some stuff away. It definitely will not be anywhere close to easy but I still want to try.

I'm tired of feeling useless and having no real talents.

My drive to achieve any goals has faded.

A part of me doesn't  want to care about being successful

The rat race is driving me crazy.

I've been fired from almost every job I've had.

Even the job I had with someone in my family.

They told me I had too many mental problems.

Everyday I watch my family go to jobs they hate and spend most of their free time sleeping.

I have mental problems that keep me locked in the house.

I'm mostly introverted and I try to enjoy my own company.

Everyone I ever meet has never tried to keep in touch with me.

When speaking online to people I'm ignored most of the time.

So I stay quiet because I already know the outcome.

My councilor has missed two of the meeting we were suppose to have.

Acting like they didn't know they had an appointment.

If anyone read this I will be surprised.

God please help me !

14,My therapist thinks I'm too depressed for therapy,"So my therapist that I've only seen two times thinks I'm not a good candidate for therapy. She thinks that I'm too depressed for it despite being on heavy medications that I'm going to see a doctor about and re-evaluate in a few weeks.

She didn't think that a combination of psychotherapy and medications combined would work for me. Instead She suggested ECT treatment after only talking for 80 minutes total.

After doing extensive research this is only offered AFTER you have tried a combination of both therapy and meds and have psychotic symptoms and have a high risk for suicide, all of which I don't have. 

I am severely depressed but my life is incredibly stable for the first time in my life. I know how to handle my depression and my anxiety and do so very well (which she agreed on, mind you) but she still thinks I'm too depressed and she's afraid therapy might make it worse. 

I've done CBT before (only for my anxiety) so I am well aware it might get much worse before it gets better. Yet the CBT was very successful and no matter how hard it got and how badly I wanted to quit, I still showed up for every single appointment and did every homework I got. 

I am not a quitter nor will I ever be. 

All I want is some help to get better without frying my brain. Is that too much to ask for? Am I unreasonable for thinking that psychotherapy and trauma therapy might be a good place to start?

And the answers are usually: go to therapy. On the one hand, yea therapy is good for mental health shit. But it’s not that easy to actually get in. Especially in my country.

It took me a *year* to find a therapist that wasn’t booked and was open before 9 and after 5. Which was a non starter because lo and behold offices and jobs tend to want you working for them between 9am-5pm so you can’t go gallivanting off to talk to your therapist for an hour. Finally found one and come to find out my insurance won’t cover them. Going to this therapist costs me $99 a week. That’s more than I spend on groceries.

3,I (24 f) got dressed and did a bit of my makeup to meet up with a friend at a coffee shop. I’m in the middle of a depressive episode and dealing with some great difficulties in my personal life. She didn’t show up. This was my attempt to “reach out”.,"Update:

Sorry in advance, I’m on mobile and this is long. 
I really wasn’t expecting this amount of support and kindness from so many people. Thank you all for the uplifting words and thank you for the rewards! 

I’d like to first address any concerns about meeting up during the pandemic. My friend and I made plans to meet up at a coffee shop, buy a quick cup of coffee, and then immediately head to a park nearby in separate cars. The coffee shop is on small a military base so that cuts the amount of people that were in there down by a lot. I went ahead and grabbed coffee and then waited on a bench outside of the shop for around 30 minutes or so before leaving. I stayed 6 feet away from others and wore a mask the entire time. I played it safe and went by the rules.

Next I’d like to say thank you to those who have helped me realize how big of an accomplishment it was for me to get to the coffee shop. It really did take a lot of effort and I appreciate the reminder that it took strength I didn’t know I had. 

I also want to thank those who have expressed empathy towards my friend. She is going through a rough time and has been since long before the pandemic started. I wasn’t angry at her because I understand that she’s struggling too. I was just really sad and disappointed because I’ve only seen her once since last year. It was more of a bummer than anything and I just needed somewhere to get it off of my chest so I came to Reddit. Kind people of Reddit, you did not disappoint! 

I’m going to continue being her friend because she is very dear to me. Knowing the kind of person she is, she probably truly forgot, there was a potential miscommunication, or she may have had something come up that she couldn’t get out of. It would have been nice to get a bit of a heads up or an explanation, but I haven’t dwelled on it too much. She’ll reach out when she’s ready to. If not, then I understand that too. 

I’ve been in therapy and medication since 2018 and recently sent a cease &amp; desist letter and went no contact with my mother. As a result of that I haven’t heard from my Dad since it happened. I also live states away from my childhood friends and what’s left of the family that supports me (not many people). I’m better off being out of that toxic environment but it’s still a grief process losing people that are still alive. I have also been grieving what could have been if I only had healthy and supportive parents. 

I’m also struggling with my marriage. I’m a military spouse and it’s hard being so far away from the little support I have states away (my sisters). I won’t go into detail here about my rocky marriage but it’s been traumatic and hard. I haven’t gotten much support other than therapy and the support my younger sisters have been capable of giving. I’m in the process of filling out divorce papers and working with an attorneys office to explore my options. 

I also had surgery at the end of October to repair a hernia. It wasn’t too big of a deal, and my sisters came from out of town to visit during my recovery, but it did knock me down a bit emotionally because I was restricted from carrying anything over 20 pounds. That meant I couldn’t hold my toddler who is 30 pounds and that was really hard on both of us. 

It just would’ve been nice to be able to have hung out and talked to the one friend I have here about everything going on. It honestly would’ve been nice to talk about things that have nothing to do with all of the crap that has  gone on this year too. 

It’s okay though! Life will carry on and there will be better days. I still got my coffee, got outside, then came home and hung out with my son and put up Christmas decorations. 
I also got a ton of fantastic advise and support from you lovely folks. Thank you again!

TL;DR Thank you for the support and kind words! I’m not mad at my friend, just sad we couldn’t meet up. I followed social distancing rules when going out. 2020 has sucked but personally, so has the past decade or so.",jz3rhk,2968,0.99,92,2020-11-22 21:19:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jz3rhk/i_24_f_got_dressed_and_did_a_bit_of_my_makeup_to/,False,False,2020,11

6,My therapist gave me an advice that I wanted to share,"As a part of my mental illness, I suffer from strong self doubts and feelings of being worthless. And I often got told that if I have these, I need to think very positively about myself and realise that these thoughts aren't true. But it never worked, my negativity is way too strong to be able to habe any positive thoughts about myself, let alone to have stronger positive than negative thoughts.

So my current therapist suggested another approach. She said, instead of forcing myself to think positive, I should try to not evaluate myself at all for a certrain time. Neither negatively nor positively (though the second is rather rare anyway). What this does is that it gives some distance to the negative thoughts and therefore breaks that cycle of depression where depression makes me have negative thoughts and the negative thoughts make me depressed.

This is way easier because I just have to be neutral instead of positive and I notice what she means with breaking the cycle. I hope that this might help someone here.

This month, I'm making myself do NaNoWriMo.   


I presume the idea is that, at some point, you start enjoying things again, but I haven't ever managed to get to that stage. I dread my side hustle. I never know what to say about books until I start writing. I write exactly the number of words I need to hit my goal and then I stop. I don't enjoy any of it. Some of it, I really hate. And I've been doing the side hustle for a year and five months, and the blog for two years, so it's not a matter of it 'give it time'. 

&#x200B;

I don't know how to make myself do things if I don't treat them as obligations. Anything optional, I just don't do. It feels like a vicious cycle where the only way to make myself do something also makes me hate it! Is there a way around this? Has anyone else felt this? I can't seem to find anything online that even mentions this being a problem, let alone actually proposing a solution.

10,"Having wonderful, loving, supportive family doesn’t make you any less depressed.","I have two extremely loving parents, a supportive sister, and a handful of close friends who I know would always listen if I needed it. I am still extremely depressed and ready to end it all. I attempted suicide 4 years ago, ended up in the psych ward for 2 weeks, and my family and friends visited every day. 

I can barely function anymore. I try so incredibly hard every day to be normal, to work, walk, chat, and appear fine. Mentally, I am thinking about killing myself for hours every day. Today I lost it, blew off work, and slept the entire day. I cried to my mother and she cried with me. Asked me what I needed, willing to do anything, but it doesn’t help. 

There isn’t anything wrong with me. I’m young, pretty, thin, and am capable of making friends and keeping them. I have a STEM degree, I’ve had committed relationships. None of that makes me happy. The true tragedy of my life is that I know I could do more, be more, and I just cant. 

I’ve been told I am strong because I haven’t done drugs or drank, because I powered through my degree, because I haven’t killed myself. I’m not strong, I’m guilted. Having a family who loves you and you love is a double edged sword. 

Love doesn’t cure depression. It does wrack you with guilt if you even think of attempting it. It would destroy my family. I’m not exaggerating. They have all told me individually, may times, that it would. My parents would never forgive themselves. I would haunt them forever.

I tried therapy. After I got out of the hospital I was on anti-depressants. I tried different meds, I saw 4 different therapists. It all just made it so much worse. One of my therapists almost got me involuntarily recommitted to the hospital. Her talking to my parents and ensuring they would be picking me up and taking me home was the only thing that saved me. 

Even the “good” therapists just made me feel worse. I would leave every appointment more depressed than I came in. I quit trying that after a year. The thing about therapy is that you are forced to lie. I was suicidal but couldn’t talk about it. If they suspect anything you get the cops called on you and they forces you into the prison that is the psych ward. They force medication on you, get you fired from your job, and destroy whatever remnants of a life you had. 

My mother is a certified grief councillor. She volunteers in hospice and regularly supports grieving people. She can’t help me. Talking to her is pointless. She will cry and beg me not to. It doesn’t make me feel better, just guilty.

All this rambling because the truth is that I am without hope. My family is dragging me through life. All the love in the world and it doesn’t make a fucking difference. Drugs, therapy, doesn’t matter. Depression is a death sentence and there is no cure. 

My only hope is to distance myself from them and one day just do it. Push them far enough away that they grieve me and move on. That way, killing myself won’t affect anyone.

11,I feel like I’m getting dumber and dumber everyday.,"I don’t know if there’s something physically wrong with me or if it’s just stress related, but for about 2 years now, I feel as if my cognitive abilities have been worsening. 

I can barely hold a conversation anymore. When I do talk, I stutter/stammer/mispronounce words. My mind blanks out a lot and my attention span is nonexistent. 

I used to be a really smart kid. Performed very well on the SAT despite having awful grades due to feeling indifferent about school. Then after high school, I became a full blown hypochondriac along with having generalized/social anxiety as well. 2 years ago I felt like I was THE man, and today I feel like an incompetent moron who becomes less functional each day. I think I’m recovering from my anxiety disorders, but I sometimes wonder if I’m actually just normalizing them, causing the illusion of recovery.

I don’t know where to go. I’ve really been trying to get better but I feel like I go two steps forward and three steps back. Can anyone else relate to this? Currently typing this out standing in the shower, feeling pretty down right now.

17,I'm just saying I've never been thankful that I didn't kill myself,"Ever since my first suicidal thoughts when I was like 14 (22 now) people say ""aren't you so thankful you're still here?""



No. The answer is always no. I've never once thought I'm glad I didn't do it. I've only ever regretted NOT doing it. If I had just acted on my first suicidal impulses or any of them after I'd have been so much better off. Not a thing has happened I should've cared about missing.



My life has only gotten so so much worse. Now I WISH I felt how I did when I first felt suicidal. That was roses compared to this shit and I actively wanted to die then too. My life has gotten so much more fucked up than i could've ever thought then, and I really only would've missed out on suffering.



I've only been alive because 1. Suicide is way harder than people think and 2. I'm supposed to and guess what?

18,Depression turns me into a bitter self-destructive asshole w no empathy,"It’s such a toxic downward spiral. My depression manifests itself as chronic indifference, loss of interest in doing anything, no hope/purpose in life, and the general malaise causes me to, perhaps worst of all, turn into a bitter, insufferable asshole. Everything and everyone bothers me to a much stronger degree. I become increasingly judgemental and dismissive of others. I lash out and hurt those close to me when I need them most. It’s like I’m a completely different person; everything sucks, everyone sucks, and I don’t want to deal with any of it. 

It’s incredibly destructive but I honestly can’t help myself, as I’m too depressed to even maintain a conversation and feign interest or empathy in anyone to begin with. I used to be so charismatic, but trying to rekindle that energy again just makes me come off as janky and contrived. Again, I’m like a completely different person.

21,Don't promise a mentally ill person that you'll never leave them.,"It's just fucking cruel.

I first had a best friend who did this, in all fairness it was my fault our relationship downhill but even during that she insisted she'd still be there for me, yet when I eventually decide to try take up the offer to reconnect I'm ghosted.

Then my boyfriend promised me he'd never leave me throughout the 8 months we were together but then he dumps me out of the blue , the half assed stuff he did tell me was likely just because he thought id fucking kill myself if he was truthful. He said he still wants to be there for me but has yet to give off even a sense that he cares, I wouldn't be suprised if he got with the girl he almost cheated on me with right after dumping me.

My point is, never make a promise like this to someone who you know is vulnerable. You KNOW they'll most likely use you as a pillar for support and when you promise them that you'll never leave you give them false hope that crashes down on them twice as hard because of that promise. It's just a fucking cruel thing to do.",k1k9bd,1683,0.98,82,2020-11-26 18:12:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/k1k9bd/dont_promise_a_mentally_ill_person_that_youll/,False,False,2020,11

24,25 years old with absolutely no friends,"I'm a 25-year-old girl. I'll just get straight to the point. I have no friends, no boyfriend, nothing. Somehow I was the popular girl in class (I'm doing masters), and I was always surrounded by a huge group of ""friends"". All that changed this quarantine. I began to see how much I was never really needed in these people's lives. It first hit me on my birthday - the people I thought were close to me, didn't even bother doing a video call for me, or even send anything on my birthday. This was in stark contrast to another girl's birthday in the group - they all had a video call (I was told to join), made a loving video for her (compilation of clips and pictures), and had a small virtual party for her.

This really hurt me, and over the next few months, I saw them drifting more and more away. Now, this has been the pattern for ""friends"" throughout my life - my work friends, and even school friends. These all are people I was immensely close to at one point.   But now I'm not in touch with anyone. Whenever I do try to strike up conversations, they just humor me for a few minutes before ending the conversation. Or other times, they are already close with each other as a group and I feel like an outsider.

Another thing - whenever I thought I was best friends with someone, they instantly replaced me with someone bubblier, more extroverted, or more ""fun"" within months. This has happened to me since my school days. It hurt me a lot but I didn't speak about it for fear of looking desperate or being ridiculed. So I bottle it all in. An incident that will be always etched in my mind is something that happened on my 22nd birthday - my boyfriend at the time had broken up with me, and I was all alone. There was a girl who I naively thought was my best friend up until that time. I ended up buying and taking a cake to her place in the hopes that we would celebrate my bday, or maybe she had something planned for me (she did it for all her other friends). When I got there, she looked surprised and very very much like she pitied me. She hadn't even remembered my birthday.

It's come to the point that legit the only people that truly care for me and have time for me are my parents. That's it.

Idk what I'm trying to say with this post. Is there anyone out there who feels or experiences the same thing as me? How do you deal with it?

EDIT: I'm literally crying my eyes out with the support that's pouring in and the stories you all are sharing. I had no idea there are so many people who feel the same way as me. I'm at a loss for words seriously you guys are the best, thank you for making me feel like I'm not absolutely alone.

1,I secretly hope that I will be diagnosed with a terminal illness so I can die without taking my own life,"Hey Reddit. Drunk me here, mainly looking to vent because I have noone else. No alts because fuck it, might dox myself.

Picture this, I met a woman. I fell in love. Hopelessly in love. Three years later, she gets pregnant. We were both young, and scared, but I tell myself I will do anything I can to make it work.

I have a baby. I cry. I promise MY baby girl the world, and the love I never had. But then things change.

The woman lives with her parents, I no longer can stay there with her and her family due to ""covid."" Okay thats fine. Go to the store? Quarantine for two weeks. Saw someone? Quarantine for two weeks. Quickly realized my opinion is not regarded about the baby. My input has no sway on how to raise her. Suddenly feel like a babysitter, I am ""allowed"" to come over after work, watch the baby, while her mom ignores me.

Eventually the woman I fell in love with starts being distant. It's little things at first. She doesn't want to cuddle. She stops kissing me. She stops inviting me to things. Then she tells me she's gay.

I decide I can make it work right? I love this woman! She says she wants to be with me still? I'll make it work of course. But then she starts antagonizing me. Insinuating I am a bad father for not being there full time for the baby when I dont have a choice. Ignoring me. Arguing with me.

I am... heartbroken. I don't know how else to describe it. I can't help but ask myself if I did something wrong. I keep telling myself I can make this work but it only gets worse. I have recently fallen into the worst depression of my life. I have had a couple suicide attempts in the past, the only thing stopping me now is knowing I would be leaving my baby girl without a father.

I dont know what to do. I donf know what this post was to accomplish. Maybe to rant? Get this off my chest? Who knows. I sure don't.

8,If you told me I had five minutes left to live I’d be relieved.,"Posting this from my second account. 

This year has been the worst of my (26 F)  life. 

My dad died a month ago today due to a pulmonary embolism. I’m devastated. I also had my fourth miscarriage earlier this year and my fiancé left me after cheating on me the whole relationship. 
I’m in school to be a teacher and due to dads death it isn’t going well. 

I’ve stopped talking to friends and told them I’ll talk to them after Christmas. I don’t feel like pretending to be fine to appease them. 

I’ve stopped eating healthy and lost all this weight very rapidly. 

I don’t sleep. I stay up late and wake up early. 

I feel like everyone hates me and I’m a failure. I also feel terribly lonely. I just don’t see light at the end of the tunnel and I’m in a lot of pain. 

I’m not suicidal but if you told me I only had a few minutes left to live I’d be very relieved and I’d go as far to say... joyful.

Edit: thanks for all the messages and awards. Every minute I draw breath is a struggle. I wish life would just be over but thank you all for your help. 

My first three pregnancies were conceived in an abusive relationship non-consensually between 16-19. This time was very much different and fiancé was long gone by time I found out but I was happy my parents and I were happy. 

I bought my dad this precious cup that said grandpa on with foghorn leghorn fishing with the chicken hawk. I’ve lost any hope I had for the future and only the mug and I remain. Thanks for your kind words Internet neighbors I appreciate it.

9,"You can't kill yourself, think of your family!","Yup, no shit. Every time I would ever come out as suicidal, that's always the first thing they say. The crutch for my existence is reliant on others wanting me to struggle in the same foggy waters that I've been struggling in for years. I know they're trying to help, but it doesn't help, it just guilts me into a corner and leaves me being perpetually sad all the time. It leaves me with the impression that if I sever ties with everyone to the point where I am, in their eyes, irredeemable garbage, that maybe I'll finally be free from my death causing pain to others. At least that was my impression before I realized the hard way that it would only shift the pain from my death to my actions. So even if I get lucky, and my suicide was clean, It will never be painless. So, for now I'm trapped, there is simply no solution other than think about wanting to die and feeling selfish right after.

Edit: I sympathize for the people in this thread who's parents are part of the problem.  That makes this statement much, much worse. The people trying to help are effectively assuming that you have the same loving parents and probably tell you things about their parents you would kill to have for one day. That sounds like a rusted knife to the chest, and I'm sorry you have to deal with that. To people with worthless, unsupportiave parents, I hope you can get out of that situation as soon as possible and find a support group. And I hope the cretins that drive their kids to suicide eventually receive the same torment that they have dished out.",kctnhy,1627,0.98,146,2020-12-14 08:15:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kctnhy/you_cant_kill_yourself_think_of_your_family/,False,False,2020,12
10,"Do you also feel like this, totally neutral and absolutely bored with life, feeling that nothing has real substance and colour ?"," 

Hello folks, I feel a certain way since years and I try to muffle it as hard as I can but it's getting impossible and I wanna know if you feel like this too, or what is it.

I've always found interest in quite everything and i've tried to do everything around me that I was actually able to (psychologically or physically speaking).  
But I can't get invested in anything I do. Any activities that I do are short and if they go on for too long I get bored.  
I force myself to do quite everythings, I force myself to feel emotions (like happiness when I get a gift or happiness when I win on games) and the only emotions that are spontaneous and ""real"" from me are frustration and absolute void.  
When I don't force myself to live emotions out of peer pressure, I feel absolutely neutral and quite sad about life.  
Everything seems washed out and boring, literally everything.  
Nothing stimulates me or give me a feeling of pleasure or joy.  
Nothing really interests me and I feel like i've done everything that I HAD to do in my life and I only see one option now : that it's over !  
(I don't wanna suicide even if sometimes I think about it, I won't do it because I don't want to but it just feels like life is meaningless now and it's the only logical choice)  
I got the checklist done, everything else is purely boring and non stimulating, so I don't really wanna live anymore.  
Because literally everything that I do makes me suffer, even writing this text.  
Because I feel like it's useless and boring.

13,I plan to kill myself tonight with a plastic bag (suffocation),"I'm 14
my mom doesn't take my mental health seriously and ignores what I've tried to tell her. And the reason why I want to commit suicide? Because of my life, my family, school. My mom says everyday that I'm useless, dumb, why can't I be like my brother. She says I'm a disappointment, why didn't see listen to the dreams from Jesus about me being a horrible daughter, how she wished she could abort me when she got the chance. My dad doesn't even do anything to stop my mom. My mom earlier this year pushed me on the floor, and choked me because she was really angry. I feel worthless, and pathetic. I have no friends at school, everyone ignores me, and I have zero social skills, how fun. My extended family doesnt even like me, my mom tells them heavily exaggerated stories about me that makes me look like a bad person. I'm failing math because I dont get any of the material, I tried seeking help, but my dad gets fed up with me not keeping up at his learning pace. I'm ugly, and skinny. My cousins make fun of my body, saying how I look like a flat stick. And on top of that, I can't even think straight anymore, suicidal thoughts and urges have basically took over my life. I feel like the odd person always, I feel disgusted with myself. Like I can't even look at myself without all these negative thoughts flooding in. I'm lonely, 0 social life. I've been dealing with this for 5 years, I cant take it anymore. Im burned out. I have no motivation to keep going. And before you say ""Your family will be sad"" I do not care. I am done. Maybe when I die I can finally seek the revenge I deserve. I just want to die, I'm still surprised that I lived to my 14th birthday. My mom says to ""Pray that I get better"" Or that I'm not reading enough of the bible. I'm SICK of it. She says a demon has probably took over me because I feel the way I feel. She knows that I'm deppressed and won't let me see a therapist. I hope that she can stop my brother from having the same fate as me.

15,I think my life is destined to end in suicide,"My depression never goes away even though I've cycled through different therapists and medication for 7+ years now. Everything is much worse than before. The slightest inconvience makes me think of ending it all. I've tried 3 times and obs failed :D. I'm only 20 and I feel like an old man who has seen it all. I have had insomnia since I was a child. I can't sleep for days sometimes. It is fucked. And when I do sleep I sleep like 18 hours and still feel tired. It is very hard to keep up with my studies with this. Oh and I'm not in college but still trying to finish high school. It's not going well. I have no job and right now have about 50 bucks to live until january, after I payed my bills. I have no friends, strained relationship with family (basically just my mom, only child, father left when I was a baby) no one to talk to. No one cares about me. It's been like this all my life. Never had a single good relationship with anyone.

This all sucks but is not the why I think I will kill myself . I KNOW all of the things I could make my life go better but I just don't see it ever happening since my mental state never gets better. I've already experienced one psychotic episode. I feel constantly on the edge of sanity. I simply can't live like this much longer. There is no help for me i've tried the ""help"" so many times already. I think I will not make it to my next birthday. But that's alright, it will be a good thing for the world. I already have violent fantasies of just going to a mall and shooting people. It's best to end it before I harm somebody else. I'm not a good person and I wont be missed.


Edit: Honestly wow. I wrote this on like half brainpower before going to sleep just getting those thoughts that have plagued me recently out. I didn't think it would get this kind of response, it was a nice suprise to wake up to since I really didn't believe there was anyone that cared anymore.

Now I’m slow, everything I say feels scripted, every movement I make feels stiff, everything I do feels fake. I feel like an imposter. I got accepted to great colleges, attended one and ended up flunking three semester due to this void inside me. I was so embarrassed of the shell of a human I had become, hollow, purposeless, no goals, just empty. Even though I’m seemingly “much better” I’m still the same. Even when things are good, this void never leaves. When it gets quiet inside me, that void grows. I don’t know if I can continue living like this. I just want to feel normal. I’m talking to this guy I really like but he’s so motivated with such a bright future ahead of him, and he likely thinks the same of me based on what I told him, but those things I said aren’t me at all. I don’t know what I’m doing with my life. I’m constantly questioning how I’m going to survive if everything keeps getting heavier and I keep getting tired and nothing has meaning anymore.

Nonetheless, I am grateful to each and every one of you, and each and every one of your words. For the first time in months, I do not feel so alone. Thank you.

&#x200B;

Despite all the years of meds and therapy and crisis counseling and being told ""things will get better, you're a beautiful strong woman and everything will turn out wonderfully if you just have patience""-I can say that, with less than six months until I turn 40, I feel no less depressed than the day I was hospitalized, at age 12, for trying to kill myself via starvation. I can say honestly that at that point, I had absolutely no trauma in my life. My parents did nothing but love and care for me. I just so happen to have a ""depressed"" brain...and the beginning of puberty allowed its awakening.

I was able to make it through high school because I went to a charter school specifically for kids with ""emotional disturbances"", but I only made it halfway through college before I had another full-fledged episode of depression and had to drop out (I was walking out of classes because I needed to cry for no reason).  I still lived at home, and about a year later my parents told me I need to work. The only job I could do, one that allowed me to come and go as I please, and take time off when I needed it, and still be able to support myself, was stripping. In the meantime I was violently raped by a ""friend"" of mine. I couldnt't deal with it, so I just went to work the next day like nothing happened, with a tampon up my ass so I wouldnt bleed everywhere. Supressed it as long as I could, until again I woke up and decided I wanted to die. Began therapy a few years later...last I saw he was happily married with children. My fucking rapist got the life I wanted and never had.....

While I was able to move out on my own thanks to dancing, after 7 years I was vomiting before shifts, And my boyfriend at the time had told me that he would never marry me as long as I was dancing. So, I decided I was mentally well enough to try school again, and graduated one year later with my certification in personal training. I spent a few years making minimum wage to build my experience, and finally I got a full-time gig with benefits. All the while noticing that my boyfriend still didnt seem into marrying me, it had been 6 years-he finally told me ""we are not financially stable yet"". Even tho he made over $100,000 a year...but alright.

Turns out, he was cheating on me with a goddamn stripclub bartender! I googled his email because I had forgotten his Amazon name, and ended up finding a whole bunch of shit that devastated me. His reaction was to first say "" I didnt think you'd ever find that"" (well, use a different handle than the one you always use next time), then to tell me that I needed to move out. Told him I didnt have the money to move out. He said he would pay for the deposit, but when I found a place-he couldnt produce it. Finally told me he didnt want me to leave after all,, we can work on this, blah. Until six months later, when he finally admitted-after 8 years-that he didnt want to marry me, ever. I just wasnt a good enough ""homemaker"". I finally asked for help from my one rich aunt, got the deposit, finally moved out..

While in the meantime, I had been promoted to head PT and trainer for new staff; despite the heartbreak at home, I actually had a job with a prestigous title (for me) and an actual, successful career. I was making enough to pay rent, and was on track for another raise...

Until 2 weeks later. When I was fired over the phone, because one front desk worker said she ""heard"" me jerking off a client on an recumbent bike. Seriously. Never in one million years would I have ever even thought of doing such a thing, but you know...she was 18 and her boyfriend enjoyed his workouts with me. That was enough for her to make sure I never worked there again...I was never accused once of jerking someone off when I was a goddam STRIPPER............

Of course with no job and no income, I was given one month's notice to move out. I found a cheap room, and was able to get some work at an old colleague's new gym. I didnt have a lot of hope for the future, but I still had a little.......

And then, I got Covid and almost died from it.

It's been six months and I'm still too weak to walk let alone train, too much brain fog to really do any sort of work, and only have two weeks of unemployment (that I had to fight for) left. I have no money and no job. No man has ever decided I was worthy enough of marriage or having a family with. My own body has become a shell of itself, and the hypoxia from Covid as well as the inflammation in my brain from it, has made my depression 1000x worse. I tell people I need help, physically and mentally, but all I have to do is say Trump could have handled this better-and they basically tell me I should kill myself because saying mean things about Trump hurts their feelings. Or, they're just so ""tired"" of the minimal restrictions that they freely admit, they just don't care about me or my health anymore. Because you know, people need indoor dining but they don't need me....

These are people who claim to love me, saying these things. This is my support system saying these things to me........

Can anyone here honestly say, if they were me, they would still have hope that ""things will get better""? I'm not doing another 40 years of this. And since Covid didn't kill me (though it came so close I was on oxygen for 6 days)-I'm nearing the point where I just have to do it myself.

I just plummet into this godawful mood like I want to fucking die and wished a semi had hit ice and flattened me earlier.  Intrusive, irrational, disgusting thoughts running buck-fuckin-wild with no control.  and the instant those are ""appeased"", all that energy turns into self-loathing.

Being up in the middle of the night feels freeing for some reason, no one awake, no guilt for responsibilities, I can sleep away the day and not feel guilty about it.

But I’m wasting time and I want more than anything to feel okay again. I want to start to get my life back to something that I can derive some genuine enjoyment out of and move forward with productive things. 

I became depressed again about 10 months ago since my mom passed and these past 10 months have gone by so fast, I’m almost 26 and I’m scared at how fast time is moving without any stability forming in my life.

Ever since I was little, I've been very emotional. As time has passed and I've been able to understand better the world around me, I find disgust.

My family is broken and I can't share my feelings with anybody, and when I do is usually with my mother and she always makes me feel worse, or guilty about everything. I feel like an idiot.

I used to go to therapy before the pandemic, it was quite good but sadly my doctor passed away due to old age. I'm not in a place right now where I can pay therapy. I'm also not motivated. I just want everything to end. I want to stop being me. I don't want these memories anymore.

11,My parents told me to kill myself,"My anxiety ate me alive this morning I felt awful and fought with my parents about it. They told me to kill myself so after panicking I took my jacket and left my home. I went to the nearest bridge and sat there with my legs out of the bridge, over the water. For the first time I was completely calm. Every other time I attempted I was as scared as hell and that was the reason I couldn’t go trough with it. Probably I would have done it this time. Instead a woman grabbed me from behind and took me back to the bridge. She even took me home scared that I would try again. I don’t even know how I should feel. I don’t know anything anymore

Edit: I wrote this post in the heat of the moment but I just wanted to tell you that my parents really love me, it was just a difficult situation I didn’t know how to calm myself and they didn’t know either.

Hope you are all doing well or if not that things get better for you <3

I know this post will be ignored but at least I tried. At least I tried to get help from my parents, friends, school, hotlines, reddit but nobody wants to help. The only person I had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me. It really broke my heart into a million pieces. Because I dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him. 

My parents called me a freak and a weirdo, said that I need to snap out of this and get over myself, after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when I was 13 (idk why I made that - 13 yr old me was questionable) they got enraged. When they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad. The tension in the house and the shame was unbearable, I couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room. Now I act like I'm fine and happy all the time, we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together, and its massively improved our relationship. I'm grateful to have parents I now get along with. But it's only because I hide my mental health. Lately things have gotten so bad, its getting hard for me to hide it from them. I'm forgetting to do things they told me to, I'm losing things they lent to me, they're getting pissed off when I didnt mean to. I'm not doing this on purpose. Got mad because I didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money. Of course it came across as rude and I felt so guilty. My whole family probably thinks I dont care about them. I feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth.

My friends - they all have it bad. Bad home lives, mental health problems, every single one of them, and I'm always trying to help them. But when I tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse. I havent spoken to them in weeks because I'm so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how I am. It's hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so I dont talk to them. I'm not okay but they're not in the right place to help me they need help themselves.

It's getting really hard to socialise. I talk to my boyfriend everyday and it's just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him, I try to cover up how bad I'm hurting but sometimes I crack, he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like I did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy. I feel so fucking shit that I cant even get my shit together.

School is so difficult. I log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying ""mental health matters guys!"" When their school counsellor wont even bother to show up. Time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me LAST MINUTE or during class when we cant use our phones, or just simply not been there. My mental health doesn't fucking matter to the school does it. They say ""its really important we look after our wellbeing"" so they suggest going out for a walk, breathing, taking breaths and ""talking to someone"", well we already know that's not fucking possible. But the other tips are just really basic level things, they don't bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists, they only tell us how to ""look after our wellbeing"" when I'm doing all those things and it's gone beyond that. I'm REALLY doing badly. And they dont care. They just expect you to get on with it. So I get told off for not participating in my live lessons. Well I'm sorry that I tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet I got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise I cant fucking do it. I cant switch off my mental health for you, school. There is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated, high achieving, focused, participating, just always okay, and I cant do it!!! And I know this will transfer into the real world, the working world, they always expect you to be okay. And it's not like I want to walk around looking all miserable, but it's just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time.

I have a university interview coming up soon. I dont know if I can do it. I'm so broken and suicidal that I dont think I can act all enthusiastic and persuade them I'd be a great, passionate, hardworking student when I can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed, dress myself and eat.

Theres so many signs I'm struggling. And nobody cares. If you're lucky, they will say they do, they spit out the cliches, give you the useless suicide hotline number and move on with their lives. In most circumstances you have to shut up and act like you're okay your whole life.

15,"Bought a gun with my stimulus for suicide, posting some ramblings here because I feel alone. It's long and I apologise for the length","Don't know where to start. But currently I'm in airbnbs using what little savings I have, trying not to think about commiting suicide. I used my stimulus check to purchase a firearm just for the peace of mind of knowing I could do it whenever I was ready, and when I realized how calm that made me, I decided to post here to see if anyone could give me some advice

I live in the desert in Arizona but I grew up in California. I've always felt alone and suicidal since a child. I was raised by my grandparents as far back as I can remember after my mother left to AZ after my half brother was born, years later my half sister was born there. After my grandparents passed when I was 16 I had to move to AZ. I've learned growing up, I was around dangerous settings, and car accidents in infancy and I'm worried that also might be a factor in why my brain is wired this way, on top of the regular stuff.

My grandparents were absolutely loving and seemed to try their best to put me in a better environment. I never told them these feelings because I wanted to be a ""perfect"" ""son"" for them in exchange for what they did for me. My grandpa was an old school cowboy type, traditional conservative..but never once told me I had to be any certain way.

As you can probably tell, polar opposite here in AZ.I have no relationship with my birth father or an idea of what he even looks like (yes no photos) anyways I was told by my parents that my father went to jail for murdering his girlfriend in CA (but he's been out for a few years already? Somehow?) and my mother and step father are convinced I'm a murderous sociopath that's going to kill them all one day randomly.

My step father choked me, and my mother and him pretty much told me to go because I make them feel uneasy. (stepfather kept a loaded gun on him in case he had to shoot me, leading to my airbnb situation) Most days at home I kept to myself in my room, but in October I went back to California for 2 weeks when my depression was hitting it's peak to see if I had hope or needed closure or something. I went back to my hometown and didn't feel any pain, I was happy for once, I was with my girlfriend who I wanted to take to prom back in CA before I had to move, and it feels like ever since I left, my life was in limbo. 

I want to go back to live with her but I need to find a job there as well as a cheap apartment, and it's extremely difficult. However she told me she's been wanting to leave home and get someplace for herself as well, it's honestly the only reason I haven't done it yet but deep down I feel like this won't work out. I have this sense of abandonment so I default to isolating myself and suffer because since childhood I've told myself over and over ""no one really cares about you"" and it still carries with me and still ruins so many of my relationships

But what's really making me finally want to go through with it, is that I did gig work, so I've been getting stimulus and the PUA, so basically money to just sit around doing nothing. I was living at home with my mother so I saved all the money. I have the title to my car (2012 nothing crazy) no debt, no student loans, and a 700 credit score. I was always the chubby kid but since covid I've lost weight (like 60 pounds) smoking weed and drinking water, I can get girls, I lost my virginity, and I'm still absolutely depressed and suicidal. I even put off losing weight for so long because I was so scared if I got in shape and hooked up with  women, & wasn't immediately happy. No Im actually feeling worse because now what? I know self care love is important and a good way to fight depression, but I lost that weight, paid off my car, reduced my debts, etc. The next goal would be to have my own home but that's just adding time to the clock like I did with my weight problem

All of this makes me terrified that what my mother and step father say is true and I should just isolate myself or die. I have NO family, when I was living with my grandparents until 16 no one ever came to visit or help, and at their funeral there was mostly friends from the neighborhood. I don't know aunties cousins uncles or any of that. That abandonment feeling was heightened because of this, because my grandparents, to me, my real parents, were abandoned by everyone when they were sick and dying. It reinforced the idea that this will happen to me too with any relationship/friendship I have. ""No one really cares"" 

I feel like no matter what life will not get better and I won't be happy, just on autopilot bouncing between feelings of absolute torment and apathy. I don't want to live for decades this way and I'd much rather die at peace. Not to mention how in my lifetime I'd be contributing so much pollution and waste to the world for an existence that isn't even appreciative of being alive. One other thing is holding me back is that I'm perfectly healthy and wish I could give all my organs away, I know they have to be on ice but I was planning on shooting myself deep in the mountains at sunset to let my body be given back to nature, but my kidneys could help save a child's life so it feels like a waste and insult 

I'm also very scared of dying and there being a hell and eternal punishment, I was never really religious but my grandma tried to raise me catholic and that fear is still always there. With age my thoughts of suicide went from ""I hate myself and want to die"" to ""I feel nothing and things would be easier for me and them if I was never born"". I don't keep ammo with me because now, I feel like that peaceful mountain death is the only thing keeping me going and as soon I get some ammo Im going on that drive",kz4j2r,1503,0.98,150,2021-01-17 11:03:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kz4j2r/bought_a_gun_with_my_stimulus_for_suicide_posting/,False,False,2021,1

19,I think acting depressed around people was a mistake,"No one gives a shit lmao. Unless you have a very special person who's very close to you, whoever notices you're acting off will not want to help, because you're not fun to be around, and in the end you'll just lose connections.

Truth is, you're way better off if you force a smile on your face. If I had known this before, I feel like I might have had more and better relations with people that I would have liked.

Don't get me wrong, I think its important for people to talk about their depression and be true to themselves. But it's just simply futile to mope around depressed around your peers since that's just gonna insure that no one's ever gonna talk to you, its a terrible alternative. So ""give in"" if you want to help yourself.

EDIT: okay, I was wrong. I really should not have gotten this many upvotes. I know no one is gonna see this since I'm editing after like a month, but I was wrong. 

Talking to people helps so, so much. Its just, you gotta find the right people, or you gotta build a friendship with someone to eventually be able to talk about your depression. Its true that forcing a smile on your face will probably help you to build these kind of friendships, and its true its not a good idea express your depression to randoms just like that.

 But I just want to say, don't bottle up your feelings forever. Do what you must to create friendships with people that enable you to do this. Often forcing a smile helps for this.

20,Six Years Ago Today I Tried to Kill Myself,"January 9, 2015 I tried to kill myself.  Today, I am in an even worse position than I was.  I'm now separated from my husband, caring for my son alone, a quarter of a million dollars in debt from school, living alone in a townhouse I can't afford, and having chronic health issues.  I don't want to die now, but God, I can't help but think how much better things would have been if I was successful 6 years ago.  My son wouldn't have to grow up in a broken home.  I wouldn't be crying every single day.  I wouldn't be trying to finish school when I can barely function.  My body wouldn't feel like it was shutting down.  There would be none of this suffering.  I guess what I'm saying is this living thing was only worth it because I got a child out of it.  I got to know the real love for my baby, and now I'll never ever kill myself because I have him and he will need me forever.  Which coincidentally means I have to suffer forever until I die naturally.  :( Sorry, just in my feelings today.  I want to celebrate my 6 more years of life, but I just can't.  There's nothing to celebrate about living a life like mine.  Maybe I don't think positively enough.

22,I feel like I have to at least try to kill myself before anyone takes me seriously. (17f),"This is long and I feel like I’m attention seeking for even writing this, but it’s how I feel. I could never actually do anything, but I’m tired and don’t know what else to do.

Everyone in my life seems to think that just because they don’t see me crying 24/7, I’m not depressed. But when I do end up opening up and crying, they take it personally and blame themselves or me and make me feel so ungrateful that I feel horrible for even trying to express anything. In result, I usually try and suppress my emotions to keep from bothering anyone and especially prevent making my mom feel bad as she tries her best. 

Thankfully, somedays I’m numb and can’t feel anything at all. 

My mom who I love dearly, feels that because I don’t pay any bills and don’t go to work, there’s absolutely no reason why I should be depressed. Which makes sense I guess, but my brain apparently doesn’t agree lol. 

I zone out as an escape sometimes and end up in deeper trouble. I’m weeks behind on my schoolwork and have teachers calling me everyday, being patronizing and snippy about the missing work and I hate myself for it. I’m occupying valuable space in their class, and for what? I feel like I’ll never get caught up. I just want to be dead or at least in the hospital or something so that they’ll leave me alone, a thought that I’ll most likely never act on. Every time I look at my work, I get incredibly nervous and can’t think of anything else but failing and how angry they probably are with me. 

My mom is disappointed in me and no matter what I do or say, she doesn’t believe me and I end up giving up in the end because I feel like nothing. I look like a terrible student which is so different from my previous school years. I feel like I try so hard, but there’s no evidence to support it. I really wish I could do more, but I can’t, I try to force myself, but I can’t get much done and I don’t know why. I’m a terrible student, dumb, useless, and can’t complete work on time. I’ve had no motivation for my work or anything else (like washing my hair or getting out of bed) completely disgusting, I know. 

I also have no friends. Normally, people exaggerate and say they have “no friends,” but at least have one or two. I have none. No one to talk to or confide in. I’ve never fit in anywhere and have social anxiety. No one cares. No one’s ever cared.

I struggle completely alone and have for seven years. I’ve lost interest in everything I used to love, and it hurts so much. I think about killing myself almost everyday, but I’m a coward and would never do it. 

I’ve asked in the past about seeing a therapist (covid makes the process even harder), but felt so horrible even asking because my mom said ‘fine, but she’d have to pick up extra shifts to afford it’ and that she didn’t understand why I couldn’t just talk to her because we’re close instead of being ungrateful and wanting to rely on a stranger and meds to make me stable like someone with real issues. 

I know she was just frustrated, but it’s statements like those that make me wish depression was more common and visible like the flu or something, so that I wouldn’t have to explain or feel weird or bad about getting treatment. 

It won’t be until I finally do something actually harmful, physical, and visible (my current “self harm” which I don’t do often, isn’t) that I might get help. If I can even be helped. But I won’t and probably never will. 

I feel like nothing and a huge burden at the same time. A complete failure. And although I try to be as selfless as I can, I appear and feel like a selfish, ungrateful brat. I don’t have a bad life and my parents are great so why do I feel this way? There have been days where it felt like it could possibly get better, but I kid myself every time. Each year it somehow gets worst. I don’t really want to die, but hate my entire existence and want to get away. 

Also, I know this probably seems trivial and somewhat whiny. I’m sorry for bothering you all. I didn’t know where else to put this and it felt somewhat soothing to vent. Thank you if you decided to read this.


Edit: I’m typically a very private person so it took a lot to share this. Thank you all for being kind and giving me advice, I’m eternally grateful. I feel less alone now. It felt really nice to finally vent, I’m staying strong and am not going to let depression win.

23,A burden.,"No one wants to spend time with a negative person, no one makes time for someone who is having a hard time. No one wants to hear bad things, complains, issues that others are struggling with. None of this is fun, so no one truly cares, no one puts the effort into a relationship whether is a friendship or more.
Most people are selfish and that's ok. People don't own people. Everyone deals with things and that's ok.

So I'm giving up asking for help, I don't want to bother anyone anymore. I don't want to upset others, waste their time...
I'm just a nobody, a burden who doesn't deserve anything!

I'm not even sure why I'm writing this, probably because I've isolated myself completely and I guess, subconsciously I might appeal to this as a last attempt at admitting I desperately need help, I'm ignoring loved ones, messages from friends, everyone and I don't even understand why.

25,Many pandemic-depressives didn't have empathy for mental health sufferers until it affected them.,"Once the pandemic is over, they'll recover and resume their lives forgetting their empathy for others. 

I've been depressed from childhood  and no one cared. Imagine going through racism, bullying, social exclusion and loneliness from 5 years old to adulthood.

I've put in tremendous efforts in improving myself and meeting people through various ways, yet, I get turned down because of my appearance (race and being not conventionally attractive etc.) or my quiet/ introverted personality and therefore, written off as ""weird"". How wonderful it would be to have friends that genuinely care.

Some of these people posting on social media about caring for others and reaching out are doing it just for the likes and popularity. So many of these phonies are the same assholes that would not give me/ people like me the time of day despite  ""reaching out"" to them. 

They're nothing but insincere and hypocrites that have in the past, contributed to the loneliness and mental health issues of others.

27,i honestly can't tell if i'm depressed or lazy as shit,"hi everyone, using a throwaway to avoid identification.

as i (19F) write this, i'm on the verge of tears and have a lump in my throat for no discernible reason. before this, i spent the whole day lying in the same spot watching tv, save for the one time i got up to make myself instant noodles. at dinner, i started tearing up because i was disappointed with the food (this is kinda embarrassing). my mum keeps asking me why i'm always lying down (not in a malicious way or anything) and i can't really pinpoint the reason but i'm always unexplainably exhausted. the good days are fine and sometimes really good, but the bad days (like today) just really suck. i feel like i am suspended in time and everything is in slow motion. i have wasted yet another day.

for some context, i'm in a transitional period in my life (graduated from high school, waiting to start college in october). i've had some moments of euphoria here and there that made me feel at the top of the world (got accepted to some really good schools etc.). however, for the most part, nothing really excites me. this is a real low compared to my last 2 years of high school (consistent high achiever, top student for a bunch of subjects, you get the gist) during which i felt some degree of fulfilment because i kept getting told i was good at things. i notice that, when i'm not occupied by the hustle and bustle of school, i always get like this more intensely than otherwise (like during summer vacations).

another thing- every single friend of mine has been motivated enough to get a job and do stuff that excites them. i've barely done anything. the only 2 things i managed to bring myself to do in the last 3 months were the result of me being talked into them by various people. i am a major pushover so obviously i ended up doing them. i just cannot bring myself to apply for a part time job because everyday i just go ""i am tired and i'll do it another day"". i feel like shit because i don't know if i have a problem or if my problem is just that i'm lazy.

my head is really heavy as i write this, so i apologize for my stream-of-consciousness writing style. the reason why i'm so confused is that, when i am in social settings, i'm really lively and fun. i'm also a very typical ""gifted"" kid / overachiever  with much less to worry about that my friends who are on the edges of their seats trying to figure out what to do in the future and shit. i have a loving family and supportive friends. i am grateful for everything i have, but i just get extremely blue and temperamental for no reason sometimes. i don't dare to discuss this with anyone i know because nobody would expect this from me. 

i don't know if this information helps but i typically feel like this during long holidays. basically, if people arent giving me responsibilities, i can't bring myself to do anything.

i'm so sorry i don't have the ability to organise this coherently right now, but could anyone share what depression can feel like? or at least give me a reality check if i really am just lazy and melodramatic? some clarity would be amazing. please be as candid as possible because if it really just is an attitude problem, at least i can stop being self-pitying and start doing something about it. 

just a disclaimer: i have never seriously considered suicide but from time to time i wonder what it would be like to just disappear. don't worry about me being a danger to myself because i would never do it.

that was a really long post. if you read to the end, thank you :)

0,I hate 'foggy brain syndrome',"Does anyone else feel like their mind isn't as sharp as it used to be? Back when I was a kid, I was actually able to focus on things and had a pretty good memory. Now, it's like I'm on permanent autopilot. I rarely ever take note of my surroundings or have clear inner monologue. I'm always stuck in this half-awake state where I can't focus on multiple things at once and just kind of ""zone out"" so to speak. I also tend to forget things really quickly for some reason.

It makes me feel like some useless, brain-dead retard that can't even function normally or think basic thoughts. It's as if my cranium is rotting away or something. I'm stuck with permanent brain fog and there's nothing I can do about it. I take antidepressants and vitamin d pills, I drink lots of water, I eat healthy, but nothing works. 

I hate the fact that my brain will never work the same way again, all because of depression. It's destroying my life and I can't take it anymore.

That I only live from one day to another. That maybe my suicidal tendencies are just wanting to stop that cycle which slowly rots my mind.

2,I think my wife saved my life this morning.,"I have severe anxiety. Taking meds, but they’ve kind of stopped working like they used to. Got into a conversation with my wife yesterday and I mentioned “if I were to be in a place where I could just sit still and not have my brain worry about something, I don’t know what I would do with myself.” Anyway, I don’t get into depressive moods too often anymore,  it this morning, 3 days before our 5th anniversary vacation (we never take vacations. Never have the money.) I check my bank account and realize that all of the bills I had planned to come out last week all hit at once and put our account into the negative. By quite a bit. I panicked. My wife had been looking forward to a small trip to Chattanooga to just relax for MONTHS. The kid was to stay at my parents house and we were just going to relax for a few days. When I realized I
messed up the timing on our bills, I spiraled. I absolutely lost control and cried. Lost it. It was probably the worst I have ever felt. I was crying for about 10 minutes when I suddenly had this sense of calm wash over me. Suicide. Easy. I got out of bed, suddenly stoped crying, cleaned my face up and began getting dressed. I told my wife I was going out for a little while. She knew something was going on and refused to let me leave the house. She physically grabbed me, made me look her in the eyes and told me everything was fine. It brought me out of my head. I don’t know if it’s something that I would have gone through with, but in that moment it was the most ok I had ever been with the idea of suicide. We still don’t have the money for the trip, but that’s ok. I know I have someone looking out for me.

5,The fact that I'm supposed to keep living and I'm not allowed to kill myself annoys me honestly.,"If I don't wanna keep going why should I? I had no choice in my birth and I don't have a choice really in my death either. I mean I could off myself but no one would really respect my choice. I don't know, I don't get much joy out of life. I never really had much of a chance to, I get some but I don't know if it's worth going on and on forever. I hate all of the obligations there are to stay alive. I stay alive mostly for other people, I know that's important. I wish I could be selfish and die. I used to think growing up that once my parents both died I'd just kill myself too, I feel like that might still be a good plan for me. 

I have goals and desires, as well as things I want to do. But I also don't really enjoy life. This is all selfish I'm aware. Perhaps it's wrong of me to think this way but I feel resentment towards my existence. Resentment towards the obligations and feelings I hold towards others. Resentment of my love for them and their love for me. I daydream about becoming a major asshole to everyone, just so I can off myself and have people celebrate my death.

6,Holy fucking shit I can’t stop beating myself up over past mistakes,"I think of a name, a face, a place, a year—the only things I can recollect are negative. I’ll just be driving in the car or sitting in my room, then these thoughts hit me like a fucking locomotive: “Remember that stupid weird shit you said 6 years ago?” Or “remember that group of people whom you tried to befriend earlier in freshman year of college only to be rejected, and you didn’t really care for them much anyways but holy fuck, you are so dysfunctional and weird and retarded?” It goes on, “remember how you chose to not talk to that cute girl who showed clear-as-the-fucking-day signs of interest in you but still opted to not talk to because you’re that brain dead and insecure?”
It doesn’t stop. It never fucking does. It’s like I’m haunted by my relatively uneventful past. I involuntarily think of these social/romantic/academic/attention-deficit/practical failures, and then I think of how great it would be if I could just roll over and die, never mind how. No more mistakes. No more disappointments. I’m tired, I’m tired of being tired, and I’m tired of being tired of being. I’m not suicidal, yet at the same time, I feel like I’m just one bad day from doing myself in; however, I could never do that to my friends and family. It’s a weird fucking feeling.

I don't want to hear that my problems aren't a big deal while you stand there with your success stories and your dating histories and your loving partners. I don't want to hear your stories about how you found your SOs when this is specifically a major part of what's wrong with me; literally a simple ""this is what helped me"" would be nice, not trying to make me feel worse. I don't want to hear the same bullshit about loving myself. I barely even have the energy to write well. I want to vent about how much I hate myself. How FUCKED UP I am.

I've lost 10 years, maybe more than that to porn addiction. I don't know if I walked in on my parents or if I was exposed to sexuality at a young age. But I've been masturbating since long before I even hit puberty. And then I discovered porn. Which leads me to now. A porn addict trying to break his habits by only masturbating 3 days a week... and then that's only turned into masturbating *multiple* times a day. It's fucked my relationships up. I can make friends, guys call me cool and women call me sweet. But I just... I'm too scared to escalate sexually and romantically. I can't stand up for myself so people walk over me. I'm afraid of taking risks. I'm a virgin at almost 23. I do not have a car, can't even drive. Never held down a job. Trying to lose weight but making no progress. Never been to a bar. Only been to one party. Never hooked up. Never had a relationship. The only things I have going for me are my writing and my drawing, and even then I'm losing interest in those as well. I don't blame women. I don't blame men either. It all lies with me.

My family isn't any better. I've tried talking about this to them multiple times. I can predict exactly what they say: ""this too shall pass"", ""believe what you want to believe"" ""if you believe it won't happen, it won't."" Yeah, great. Thanks for the ""help."" And then there's the verbal abuse from my narcissistic shrew of a mother and the complete apathy of my father, who constantly tells me he'll have my back but never seems to step up when I truly need him... but he IS happy to yell at and threaten me every time I try standing up for myself against my mother. Every time I try to leave, they threaten to call the cops. I have nowhere to go, no source of income.

I am a fucked up, broken, weird piece of trash who drags the few people who care for him down with his negativity. They're better than me, none of them deserve me. I feel this void in the center of my stomach and heart wherever I go, and now that I've spent all day reading through reddit (seriously, every time these moments of depression happen, ***EVERY*** post I see has to be about sex and dating and relationships), I feel even worse. So much worse than yesterday. I can't forgive myself for the thing's I've done in the past. I sabotage myself every single time. In my worst moments I have these thoughts, these fucking FANTASIES of tying a wire to my neck and the other end to a car, and then letting the wire hang me and hopefully cutting my head off.

All I do is exist. I can't live like this. Normally I don't feel suicidal. But now the thoughts are coming back. Wanna know the funny thing? If I die, people will just go ""that sucks, pass the apple juice"", chalk me up to a statistic, and forget. Because nobody gives a shit about worthless men who can't keep up with the rest of them.

I don't even know why I wrote this. Nobody is going to notice or care. People rarely do anyways.

10,I know the post will go down here ... But I have serious problems. I should quit my life.,"First of all ... I have hesitated for a long time just to write everything that burdens me, but maybe it helps just to get rid of everything once. 

About me, 31 years old, I am psychologically completely broken and physically unfortunately also very lediert. 

My life has just gone wrong from the beginning and sometimes I wonder if some people are just lucky and others are not. 

I grew up in an already broken family. My mother was married 3x and divorced 3x (I am the child of the second husband). I can remember almost all the incidents of my childhood (which makes it worse for me) One of the first memories I have (about 3,5 years) my father went after my mother with a knife. And even stabbed through a door with a knife. He was then thrown out by my grandparents and I saw him only once a short time later. He was an alcoholic all his life and did not even try to contact me (even when my ex-wife met him by chance in the hospital 10 years ago and gave him my cell phone number...). Without my knowledge)

In the meantime he passed away about 2 months ago and I knew nothing about him except that he was an alcoholic. 

After he was no longer there, my mother had quickly met someone new, my stepfather. He was 8 years younger than my mother. 

Unfortunately, he was also very aggressive. As a chain smoker he was very quickly annoyed when he had no more cigarettes and has quickly become with things around him, it also did not take long and my mother and he have often and loudly quarreled, often thrown on dishes on the walls. He became unfortunately also now and then Handgreiflich and has beaten me and my brother (whereby my brother was rather his favorite, since he was older and could make more with him). After we have moved several times we lived in a townhouse only then it did not take long that my mother and my stepfather have also divorced. My stepfather had cheated on my mother for a long time with my cousin (yes it does not get better).

After the separation, my stepfather has emptied the joint account and has filed for bankruptcy, because no one could keep the house alone, my mother also had to file for bankruptcy. 

Shortly after that we moved of course, unfortunately my mother lost her job 3 years later and has never found a full-time job again and lives since then on social benefits. 

With my brother (child of my first husband and 3 years older than me) I never had a really good relationship, mostly he didn't want to have anything to do with me and we generally did less together. He was also not at the same school as me, he was never very educated unfortunately. 

He also moved out quite early, because he did not get along with our mother at all and even resented that she separated from our stepfather (because he got along with him). He then moved to another cousin of ours until he was 18 and even had contact with our stepfather. 

Generally he was always very strange. He watched our parents having sex or generally our mother taking a shower. (And played with himself while doing so). He is also said to have had sex with our cousin according to a friend of his. (Probably several times) And has often set fire with a friend together.

He somehow had a kind of mother complex and for many years always looked for much older women who often also had children. But usually it did not last very long. When it was over, he often set a fire somewhere. What I knew about afterwards was his own car, A garden shed, A meadow, and finally an attic of an apartment building, whereupon he was arrested and sentenced. However only on probation. 

His last partner was 11 years older than him with whom he actually held out for 6 years. Only a short time later he had a partner 11 years younger (a complete change of heart). Which was then suddenly pregnant immediately, after the first child a few weeks later she was pregnant again. 

However I had in the people 10 years very very rarely contact with my brother and we have seen us actually only when our grandparents died (who have reached a proud age 92 and 94).

In general, I have also completely broken off contact in the meantime, because after several attempts on my part, no normal relationship can develop between us. I can not even have a reasonable conversation with him, because you just notice he seems to be very stupid (I just can not express it differently).

About me .. I also made a lot of mistakes in life. 

Unfortunately for me, I almost didn't focus on my schooling and did almost nothing in class (my mom didn't care what I did or didn't do anyway, she never showed up for a parent-teacher conference either). 

I wanted to earn money as fast as possible and learned the next best thing and ended up in the camp. My goal though was to become a soldier and joined the army after my training, unfortunately I got a slipped disc there and dropped out 2 years later. 

Then I ended up in a larger company where I had worked until today. 

I started drinking myself very early (15 years), because I myself had a very bad environment, the city I lived in generally had high unemployment and there was a lot of drug dealing. Also through my education I drank almost every day after work and it was later to the point that I completely shut down 4 times a week and had a blackout several times. This was no better in the armed forces. Was able to make the leap in my mid 20's though and quit. I don't even drink beer in between anymore because I just don't feel like it. I also take my other drugs (although I sometimes wonder if maybe I should). Or smoke either.

I have always tried in my life to escape into some relationships, because I could not be alone ... My first relationship lasted 5 years circa and I was married myself and had to divorce and have a son. 

My ex-wife, however, always wanted to make life difficult for me and I got deeply into debt because of her, since she, among other things, never completed an education. Just like that, she quit her jobs and I was the sole breadwinner and often signed contracts and did not pay them, whereupon I received debt collection letters. 

I had to declare insolvency at some point, because we also had a joint loan running.

I had also met a new woman half a year later and moved. Only my ex-wife really sabotaged this relationship and it didn't last long. Also because I wanted to see my son regularly.

I then decided to stay alone for 2 years, but lived near my ex-wife again because of my son. 

When I met my current partner, I decided to finally live my own life and not always be there for others. And moved a little further away. Got another wonderful daughter and everything looked like it was going uphill.

Also this time my ex-wife has tried to make our life hell, which led to the fact that I have quarreled with my partner very often and now also have no contact with my son for a year. 

My job has also deteriorated more and more, because the company was bought up 3x and changed. The work climate has made me more and more broken and I had a second herniated disc. 

In addition, I was then admitted to a day clinic, because I was also psychologically at the end. After a few months there, I was diagnosed with trauma therapy and was also diagnosed with bipolar narcism. 

I discontinued this therapy a year later because it didn't help me at all.

In the meantime, however, I have screwed everything up ... I had to give up my job for health reasons, although I have a GDB of 30% and was equalized. I am also about to lose my partner, because there is more and more crisis between us. I really don't have anyone in my life anymore. 

I have moved 13 times in my life in general. And have lost a lot of contacts and friends. I also lost some contacts because of my ex-wife. 

I generally only have contact with some friends I met online or old work colleagues. 

I also see my mother about 1-2 times a year but I don't care if I see her at all or not. But she understandably wants contact with her grandchildren.

I must also say to myself, I was a very difficult personality from a certain point and also my friends and partners had to learn to deal with it. I always had the urge to somehow talk nonsense and can hardly ever stay serious about anything, even when I write this text. You could subordinate it under ""joke addiction or Moria"". I also have a very low frustration threshold and go crazy quickly if I just drop something. Unfortunately I'm also very forgetful and often don't know what I'm supposed to do several times a day. (I probably owe that to the alcohol). All in all, due to narcism I often have the impression of being emotionally dead. I cry in the rarest situation at all (even if sad videos still carry me away). I can hardly show empathy towards others. I also really don't care about much and I notice it more and more. That I really don't care about anything that happens. Apart from my children, I have never really had the feeling of being happy. In general, almost nothing good has ever happened to me. 

Conclusion: So now I wonder does it even make sense for me to exist? 

I am insolvent I have a divorce behind me. My partner will leave me soon. I have no job anymore. No friends . And probably soon no more apartment (since I then the insolvent also no new apartment more find). 

EDIT: 

First of all, thank you all! 

You have really touched my heart, even if it is hard for me to admit something like that. 

You don't have to worry about me doing anything to myself! 

I don't want my children to have a horrible childhood like me! 

Besides, for your love! You are really great and I understood that there are things in life worth living for! 
Of course, I will also seek professional help. 
It is not very easy to get appointments here but I will keep at it and not give up! 
I know I can't change my past but I can change my future!

My inbox has exploded with messages and I have already replied to some. Even if I wanted to, I probably won't manage to reply to every single one.

Thanks again you are great!

13,Called the suicide prevention hotline for the first time ever,"I actually felt suicidal today. Really and truly.

I haven’t told anyone I know and don’t think I will.

I’ve found that being vulnerable with some of the people who I’m supposed to be closest with only gives them more ammunition to hurt me.

And the ones I do trust, well I don’t want to feel like a burden on them.

But, it helped so much. Honestly.

Maybe it’s kind of fake cuz it’s their job and they’re trained to be empathetic and understanding, but it felt SO GOOD to have someone to listen and care.

To give a fucking shit that I am dying inside and so goddamn overwhelmed with almost all the aspects of my life.

I cried so so much. I hid in the closet of my bedroom for some privacy and just poured my all my pain and worries out to the kind lady on the phone.

She comforted me and showed me kindness and concern and that felt so fucking good to just have someone listen.

She said she’ll call in again to check in on me and that feels nice.

Please use the suicide prevention hotline. I was teetering on the edge.

Probably wasn’t going to go through with it, but I really genuinely wanted to be dead because life had just dealt me one too many blows and I couldn’t stand up anymore.

16,my pain (25F) is overwhelming: i've been quarantining in an abusive household for the last year and am in need of some kind words,"i've been struggling a lot this week. my mental health has always been shit but lately, it's just gotten worse. i recently fired my therapist because my insurance changed and she wasn't accepting the new provider (she wasn't a good fit for me either, but something is better than nothing). so aside from my boyfriend and a few friends, i don't have anyone i can rely on. i feel bad venting to the people around me because they're all going through tough times too and it just doesn't feel fair for me to unload on them. so i hope that opening up to this sub is the right idea, even though i still feel guilty expressing my pain.

the heart of it all is that i have C-PTSD (along with other psych disorders) and these past few weeks I've been drifting in and out of disassociation, flashbacks, and episodes of crying fits. i can't stop reliving my trauma and am having a tough time with positive self-talk. right now i'd say my self-worth and self-esteem are at a 0. it doesn't help that i live in an abusive household but unfortunately i don't have anywhere else to go, and this is something I've dealt with my whole life. my mother is neglectful and my father is emotionally, verbally, and sometimes physically abusive. he picked a fight with me this morning for no reason and it set me over the edge. so between the flashbacks, disassociation, and deeply painful depression, i just feel so unsafe in my house. if my parents see me crying, they'll either gaslight or bully me. i just wish things were different. i don't really know where i'm going with this post other than it would be nice to be reminded that not everyone is mean and nasty. that i am a good person and i deserve a good life. i just want to stop crying.

17,"I need at least one person to see this. I have 0 reason to live, because I can't care about my obligations to others.","If you google ""reasons to live"" they pretty much all say that they carry on living because they dont want to cause pain to their loved ones. I have very little loved ones, and I cant express enough how little I give a shit about how sad they're gonna be when I kill myself. There is no way they will feel as terrible as I do everyday, at least have the ability to get over it whereas I am condemned to this suffering until I die some other way. I think about how my girlfriend will feel if she finds out I've killed myself and I just do not care, I love more than anything, even more than myself, but I want death so badly that there is nothing that convince not to do it now. My mum, dad, brother, grandad, grandma and literally everybody in my family will be devastated beyond words, and I am fine with that. Because I will have victory for once, I will fixed it at the greatest possible cost and I'm glad. Their sadness is of no concern of mine when im fucking dead. 

I do not enjoy living, as I have stated in other posts. I dont care about the little things in life. The smell of freshly cut grass isnt a valid reason to fucking live, you jackass. I may laugh at things that are funny, and may enjoy making others laugh, and enjoy the company and love of my girlfriend, but it just isnt enough. I need some other way of relief of my problems if not suicide, I am not fucking willing to put in any hard work, because I could just kill myself lol. I need a giant stroke of luck, or a huge incredibly forgiving second chance that will just make everything go away. I wish all my problems could just be fixed by some miracle solution, and they all say it's just hard work that will fix it. 

But no pal, it's suicide and it's a legitimate solution. It ends my problems and that's all I want. I'm quite frankly sur people arent just okay with people suicide, and that it doesnt happen even more than it does. It's just such an absolute and perfect solution for everything, the only reason people stop is because they feel obligated to others, but I just dont have that filter.

19,Is it worth waiting to see if your life eventually ever gets better?,"I’m about to turn 25 and I don’t even want it this year. The disingenuous attention is going to bum me out.

Long story short, I lost my job and then got stuck at my parents house. My dad is very narcissistic and toxic and is often damaging to my mental health.

I spent this past year developing myself more, learning more into my career, reading books, becoming spiritual, and finding a cause to do good in the world. I figured all of this is pointless I might as well spend it doing at least one thing that’s bigger than me and then I can die happy. I don’t need to be famous I just wish I can move the needle positively in society or in a community in some way. 

I don’t know what that is yet but I’m learning a lot of marketing and I consider myself a creative and passionate individual. I am a musician also. I also volunteer and am involved but it’s all remote. 

Right now I don’t have a real job, I have no friends, and now my band is falling apart. Last year, no one showed up to my birthday gathering, which is kind of what caused me to start this journey. I can start a new band by myself, and I can move out and find new friends that aren’t toxic and like me and respect me, maybe even find a girlfriend. I used to have at least a couple of those things at different points in my life. I’ve been through 12 salary paying job interviews these past 2 months and none of them bite.

Now I have NOTHING. And I spent a year on myself for NOTHING. I have friends family and my therapist keep telling me “just wait, your time will come” and other similar pointless advice that gives you nothing tangible to work with and instead is just “your life sucks, you can’t do anything about it, just wait and see if it gets better”

Well what if it doesn’t? What if I get hit by a car tomorrow? God, I really hope I do. I mean, I’m thankful that I’m healthy and alive under a house but I still pay exorbitant bills and it’s really not easy even with a garbage freelance job

I don’t want to live through this bullshit anymore. It’s been a year. I want my reparations back for all the people who lied to me for all this time. 

Am I being a freak or what? Why can’t I just catch a fucking break?

20,my genitalia are destroyed after being raped and being prescribed lexapro. i don’t want to live anymore,"being raped and being on lexapro ruined my genitalia, and it’s ruining my state of mind. please help

hey yall. not sure how to start this so i think i’ll just get into it. at 12/13 years old, i (f19) started feeling deep depression due to extreme bullying at school. i started therapy, and then lexapro at 17. my anxiety decreased, but i now also had an extremely low sex drive plus genital numbness. i decided that was better than daily panic attacks and constant depression, so i took the pill regularly and properly. 

when i was 18, i was unfortunately raped several times by my long-term boyfriend, who i considered to be the love of my life. what was left of a sex drive was now destroyed, now matched with even deeper depression and incredibly, incredibly low self worth regarding my body and my sex life. 

not long after that, i was diagnosed with spastic pelvic walls, or an extreme form of vaginismus. ive always been incredibly ‘tight’ for a lack of better words, not able to fit a tampon, usually passing out from extreme panic and pain when i tried. i’m not able to have proper sex because of it. the only time i’ve been penetrated was by my ex when he would rape me, and that was the worst pain of my life, physically and emotionally. 


i’m now 19, and i’m in a happy committed relationship. i love him deeply, and he’s a great partner. however, i find myself so depressed that i can’t provide for him sexually. not only for his sake, but for mine. my entire genital region is broken, and it makes me feel like less of a woman for it. i understand that a working vagina (or any vagina for that matter) is not what makes a woman, but it’s the only way i can describe it since there’s no proper term for female emasculation. 


ive started wellbutrin and stopped lexapro around two weeks ago, and im very anxious to not see any improvement. i also start pelvic floor therapy next month to help with my pelvis spasms. 


i understand that it can take up to three months, but im looking for reassurance from others in the same boat.


i can’t keep doing this anymore. i hate myself and body, and suicide is constantly on my mind. if anyone has dealt with this or something similar, i’d love to hear your advice. thank you :)

22,I can't kill myself until my cat dies,"For as long as I can remember, I've dealt with constant suicidal ideation and intrusive thoughts of self-harm. It's gotten to the point where I feel like suicide is my destiny, because it's the only future outcome for myself I've ever envisioned.

I feel like the only thing that has prolonged my life is my cat. We are very close, especially since I've been housebound with the pandemic. She's always following me around. When I'm upset or crying, she gets in my lap to comfort me for hours. She sleeps on my chest every. night.

Every time I think about committing the act, I start to imagine what her life would be like after my passing. There's no way anyone in my family would keep or take care of her, so she'd probably end up in a shelter, where she'd be confused and depressed and constantly waiting for me to show up. Taking care of her is the only purpose I have in life, and I'm so grateful to her for giving me a reason to stick around year after year.

9,My therapist cried in a session and another therapist told me to quit her ASAP,"I have been seeing my therapist for a few years but just started recently feeling comfortable enough to open up about my past trauma to her. Upon doing so, she cried. She did try to hold it back but eventually she cried then immediately apologized and told me that I remind her of her daughter and she cares about me. It honestly was the first time I've felt love from a parental figure.  

However, during that time I was actually having a mental breakdown. I was reliving my trauma everyday and it impacted my work greatly. My boss was not understanding and my physichiatrist eventually recommended a extensive therapy group with a ""great therapist.""

This therapist was not at all what I expected. She was incredibly into the ""tough love"" approach. She made everyone go in a circle and talk about their most traumatic moments. I have social anxiety and these were strangers so I did not really participate in that. But I did talk about my therapy experience and my coping mechanisms and such. She eventually found out that my therapist cried once in a session. She told me that was ""beyond unprofessional"" and that I should ""drop her immediately."" 

I actually did end up dropping her only to get a horrible experience with another therapist. One recommended by the therapist that told me to drop my initial therapist. 

I was so sad and eventually went back to my initial therapist. I haven't seen anything wrong but I can't get help but feel insecure about my own decision. Am I making the right choice? Is it okay to go to someone cause they feel like a friend you can open up to? Are emotions bad and unprofessional for a therapist to express?

*LIL' UPDATE*

Wow! Thank you all so much for the comments and awards. It was so nice to read all of your experiences, I'm so overwhelmed with happiness rn to not feel so alone!   

I have seen 8 therapists in my life and I have never felt this comfortable with one. It honestly was the first time I haven't regretted telling a professional my personal trauma. Although not everyone agrees with this approach, her emotion ultimately showed me that I have people that care about me and it really helped me in a time when I really just needed compassion.

With that being said, I am continuing to see my empathetic therapist as that is what works best for me. 

Thank you again for all of your reassurance and encouragement in helping me choose what's best for me. I struggle a lot with decision making so I was really in my head about this. Anywho, just wanted to say you are part of a wonderful community here and I hope you all find happiness/peace.

He knocked on my door at around 6 in the morning to ask me to take him out. 6 in the morning. Im fucking half naked inching the door open while this man asks me at 6 in the morning if I can take him out to a couple places today.

I said no. I’m in the middle of finals. I know a couple places means “5 places that I’ll spend an hour each in”. 

I said no and he said alright. I thought that was the end of it. I get back in bed. An hour later he’s slamming shit in the kitchen, slamming doors closed downstairs, till finally, he comes up to me again, pounding on the door, asking me to take him somewhere. I said no and he started fucking screaming. 

Over the word no.

He eventually said nevermind and a second later he’s walking out the door slamming the door on his way out.

Over the word no.

But when I tell my parents this, *im* the wrong one for getting *him* upset and not succumbing to what *he* wants. 

My dad asked me the other day if I still had my “depression”

What the fuck does he think?

Edit: thank you for all the solidarity. I oftentimes feel like I’m an asshole and run myself into circles wondering what I did wrong in each and every moment, how I could have prevented a negative confrontation from my family by simply being agreeable with them. I struggle with this and the friends I have don’t always fully understand where I’m coming from all of the time so it’s nice seeing that I’m not insane over denying someone else.

Just thought it was unnecessary escalation. They offered to take me to hospital. My depressive episodes are sporadic enough that I can be lucid about them after but while I'm in them my mind is v numb and all I can think of is 'why am I here', and I can't answer.

I spent all my free time in high school crying and self harming at home while everyone else had friends and hobbies and went to parties. Then I did the same thing in college. I didn’t even move out from my parents house because I was too anxious to stay in a dorm. My ex used to tell me about how much fun they had in high school and how they were in a bunch of clubs and how they had the most fun in college staying in dorms with all their friends and doing fun, dumb stuff. It always destroys me to think about how I missed out on all of that because of something I couldn’t control. Now I’m 21 and just graduated college and I’m lost. I have no friends, no partner, no job, me and my family are on rough terms and I just got diagnosed with anorexia. It is just crushing me and idk what to do anymore. And I’m afraid to tell anyone because I don’t want to be sent back to a psych ward since I have no money to pay for it again. I’m just so broken right now.

I’m pushing my partner away and isolating again.

4,Just because someone has it worse doesn’t make your pain unjustified.,"I hate when people say something along the lines of, “This guy got through this, so you’ll be fine.” When someone is going through tough times in their lives, that is the last thing they’d want to hear. It makes me feel like shit and I’m sure it’s the same for them. It’s toxic and it won’t make someone who’s depressed feel any better if not worse. Think of it as, “Being stabbed by a knife hurts as much as being stabbed by a sword.” Just because the blades smaller doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt. The only reason I’m posting it here is because I hear this toxic shit everywhere. I get it if they are trying to comfort you and they don’t know what to say, but I would think they’d understand it wouldn’t make it any better just because some other guy had it worse.

While yes it can bring someone who’s whining about something trivial to perspective, there’s a line that’s crossed when you tell something like that to someone who’s actually going through depression/tough times.

It only makes me feel worse when I hear this, so if you are going through depression/tough times how would you respond to this? I honestly don’t know how and it makes me feel like shit and that me having gone through depression was something meaningless.",nk0xpn,2092,1.0,118,2021-05-24 15:44:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/nk0xpn/just_because_someone_has_it_worse_doesnt_make/,False,False,2021,5

9,When you reach that point where “what’s wrong?” no longer has an answer,"When there’s no longer any specific thing that you can pinpoint as the reason you’re feeling the way you do.

When you don’t even fully understand it yourself. Why can’t you just be happy if nothing specific happened to ruin your mood?

When you’re so used to feeling depressed that you don’t even know how to feel happy during the moments that are supposed to make you happy.

When the few things you had in life that you used to enjoy either become dull to you or impossible to motivate yourself to do.

When it starts to seem pointless to even try accomplishing anything because you know that no matter where you are in life you will probably still be depressed.

When you can no longer stand speaking to the people you love because it’s either pretend to be happy or ruin their whole mood/day and make them worried about you.

When even the most simple conversations are very hard to get through without being triggered by something and wanting to break down.

When it gets to the point where you have heavily considered abruptly cutting the people you love out of your life because interacting with them is becoming exhausting and you would rather them think you’re an asshole for isolating from them than to give them the even more painful truth about where your mind is going and what you think is inevitable.

When the overall feeling of not having anything in your life that makes you happy anymore starts to be far more painful in your mind than actually having negative things happen to you.

How do you even answer “what’s wrong?” when it’s both not anything and every single aspect of your life at the same time

10,My mom died yesterday,"My mom died yesterday night at around 12 am. She killed herself. I can only assume she has schizophrenia. The previous 2 weeks of her death, she was acting totally different, nothing of herself. She was going on about God (she was never religious) and how if we don’t believe in him we are going to hell. It all began from when she was dating this guy Joseph, and when she came home that night she was totally different. 

I now live with just my dad and sister, and all to remind I am just 16. It really hurts she is dead. All I can think about it her death. I cry off and on and some moments I feel fine then others times I feel numb. 

My family is being supportive- but none of them understand this pain. They remind me “it wasn’t her” I know it wasn’t her. My mom would have never done this to us. It doesn’t change the fact my mom is selfish for killing herself. 

I can still hear the gun shot in the bathroom. It hurts to even go into the bathroom to even touch any of her stuff. I mourn with happy pictures of her- still painful to think she would change so fast.

I looked through notebooks of hers, she used to write like it was her life. She wrote lists and lists of things to do, chore lists, grocery lists, activity lists…etc. it was never ending. 

My mom was always full of life, always ready to take on what life gave her. She never considered suicide. 

The night of when she killed herself she was preparing us all night. It hurt to hear her talk like that. She had cuts all over her body and bruises on her thighs from the 48 hours she disappeared. That morning she came home naked and wrapped up in blanket- apparently walking around the city. 

I want to let every one know that no matter what, cherish the people around you and take the sad things seriously. Never forget that that may be the last time you’ll see them.",nvl9fg,1347,0.98,162,2021-06-09 02:39:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/nvl9fg/my_mom_died_yesterday/,False,False,2021,6
11,"I was home alone the entire day today, so ofc y'all know what that means.....","I cried. I cried almost the entire 7 hours I had the house to myself. I cried without having to hide anything and wherever I felt like. I cried while playing my favourite music loud on my tv. I cried in the balcony, wow that felt good, especially the breeze hitting my face when I stood there nd sobbed. 
This was nice. My life's an absolute dumpster fire rn nd I'm a fuckin loser, always have been, who's still stuck at his toxic parents' place. No aspect of my life is right rn, be it mentally, emotionally, physically, financially etc etc u name it. True rock bottom. 
I needed this. I needed these 7 hours of crying nd just sitting nd staring at the blank wall with no need of closing the doors or fearing that someone might catch me. I'm glad I got this.

12,I'm almost 28 and i have wasted my life,"In a few months i will 28 and i have wasted my life. I have never had a job, a girlfriend, or a close friend. I graduated high school in 2012 and since then i have isolated myself rarely leaving my house. I'm posting this hoping someone will listen and maybe give advice.

I was raised by my grandparents and growing up they were controlling and overprotective. I did not get to do things most other kids were doing. I just stayed home all the time and played video games or watched tv. When i was in school i had no friends and rarely talked. I was not bullied but most of my classmates would not talk to me.  My teachers said i had a learning disability so thought out school i had extra help with my classes.. My grandfather died in 2007, After high school i isolated myself.  I have had opportunities to get jobs but i was scared to talk to strangers. The time has passed by so fast and i  cant believe i let this happened.

I Feel like there is no hope for things to change. Who would hire someone like me. I made bad grades in school and too poor to go to a community college.  I also would like a girlfriend but I'm short and too shy.  I'm very depressed and thinking about ending my life.

Edit. I never thought my post would get this much attention. I watched a youtube about suicidal thoughts and the guy said reddit helped him so i thought i would give this a try.I thank you all for the comments",nx9g76,1170,0.99,254,2021-06-11 06:44:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/nx9g76/im_almost_28_and_i_have_wasted_my_life/,False,False,2021,6

Have to see people, talk on the phone and hear the stupid fucking fax machine beeps when I'm going through major sensory overload!!!!!! Then pretend to be normal.

14,I regret not committing suicide when I was younger,"As a teenager I thought about it a lot.
Came close once or twice.
But I chickened out.

Now I regret it so much. If I had done it then, only my family would have been affected. And it’s partially their fault so maybe it would have served as a teachable moment for them.

Now, I have friends and a partner that would be absolutely destroyed if I did it. They don’t deserve it.

I wish I had done it when I still had so few attachments, when there was so little harm to be done.

Now I am condemned to exist to avoid hurting those I love.
Fuck.

4,Seeing yourself getting worse and worse and not caring enough to do anything is the worst part of depression.,"For normal people with healthy brains (honestly do those even exist anymore?), whenever things in their life are going wrong, they do what they can to fix it and get better. For those of us who are depressed and do not have that luxury, we've lost interest in caring for ourselves.

There's no clear path on how to fix our lives and the chances of actually succeeding are minimal at best. The amount of effort required is too great and we find life and especially our own lives to be meaningless so why bother trying?

I've grown more apathetic towards life and I really can be bothered to care much about myself. I see my mental state getting worse and life passing me by, bit really I just don't care. I find myself unable to relate to others when they talk about their futures because I genuinely don't see one for myself and I'm not interested in trying to build one. Especially when I have no building materials and no way of obtaining them.

This has to be the worst part about being depressed. It's an illness that makes you not care enough to get help and better yourself leading to a slow decline with endless sadness and misery while your physical health worsens. If that isn't the scariest illness then I don't know what else is.",onc1x2,1484,1.0,104,2021-07-19 11:20:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/onc1x2/seeing_yourself_getting_worse_and_worse_and_not/,False,False,2021,7
5,Knowing that suicide is always an option gives me a lot of comfort. Am I weird? How far down that depression rabbit hole am I?,"I don't have a lot to add. I'm depressed, I guess? This has been going on for decades. I don't know anymore. Am I really depressed anymore, or has it turned into something else? I hate being awake. I wake up every day in a state of shock, overcome with dread. I sleep as much as possible, but I have always had insomnia, so I only get a good night's sleep every 2-3 weeks. I snap awake as soon as I start falling asleep. I've tried medication, therapy, and jesus, but nothing has helped. I recently realized that living with my father is a huge source of stress and anxiety for me. He's emotionally and mentally abusive to me every day. I am moving out soon, which is great (I hope), but I am not expecting all my problems to magically disappear. Despite it all, I am working hard to get a good education and build a better life for myself. Why? I honestly don't know. Because it's expected of me, I guess? What do I want out of life? To be happy, of course! But we all know that ""happy"" isn't realistically achievable. Life is never perfect, so I guess I am aiming for something more modest, like contentment. To me, contentment would be a quiet simple life with very little stress. Not a lazy life, per se, but one where there is little or no pressure on me to do things I simply don't want, and don't need, to do.

6,Depression makes me SO boring,Honestly I am so damn boring. Like.. its a main reason why I don't date anyone and never will. Its a reason why I have no friends and never will. Nothing really interests me so I don't have much to talk about. I suck at all conversations and once again I'm so boring. When i was a kid I had a personality I was funny and goofy and happy. Now I'm just a dead zombie that will laugh at things in public to not seem depressed. But my brain is so dead from depression I can't come up with any jokes or shit. The only thing I can do is listen and barely speak which I actually hate. I wanna be funny and have a personality and be desirable but I'm not that. I know its depression that causes it.,odt25a,1454,1.0,111,2021-07-04 21:06:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/odt25a/depression_makes_me_so_boring/,False,False,2021,7
7,"I don't want to kill myself, I just don't want to exist","My life feels to be falling apart. I don't know how to explain it other than my limbs all being stretched and physically unraveling and dislodging. 

My brain is rot and my insides are rot. Rotted goop. 

I don't have a purpose in life, I have no dreams in life, I'm wasting away the prime of my life. I dive into my eating disorder to cope and get high sometimes and self-harm. 

Therapy for me of 3 years failed and my therapist took an indefinite leave so that went down the drain. My psychiatrist is cool but I've tried 15+ meds and nothing really works. 

I can't figure out this big issue in my life and I repeatedly obsess and ruminate over it with no answers or solutions as I sit paralyzed in fear. 

I think I just realized today that my depression has been getting worse in ways I didn't recognize as I've gone up on this new medication. Talking to people has become more of a chore than it used to be. It gets on my nerves to have to speak up or when anyone talks to me. I don't care to talk about anything I'm interested in anymore. I used to at least have some interest in certain topics, but now I just don't care and I don't want to talk to anyone. Every word said to me or that I say is a fork on a chalkboard. I have to psych myself up to raise my voice and speak. 

I don't care about doing things I used to do with friends. Well, I care less, anyway. Or more like I'm just indifferent. Numbed out... I still care. But it doesn't feel as...there? It feels like I'm wearing emotion-canceling headphones. It's all still there, but it's so muted. 

I can't stay awake during the day at work at all. Worse now than before. I find myself seeming to play less with my wonderful pets...

I've lost credibility at work and plateaued with my ability. And I just don't care anymore. It makes me feel bad but I don't care enough to do anything about it at all. I realize I suck at my work but so what. I've already failed, I still fail. So what... 

My motivation was already shit but now it's more like I don't care... I used to be upset that my motivation was gone, angry about it, in a sense? And now I kind of just don't give a shit. I recognize that my motivation is still gone and sure it's still upsetting but not as upsetting as it was because I don't feel the anger at myself as much. 

Occasionally I have bursts of extreme emotion, like yesterday I had a MAJOR anger rage moment where I had to take anti anxiety meds to even remotely start to calm down after a period of screaming, slamming things around and knocking things over and self-harming viciously in a frenzy. 

Some days I burst into tears for all night and just keep a rag with me to soak up the tears as the time passes and I try to do things that fall within my normal schedule and small range of activities I do once I go home from work. 

Every day is a repeat of the day before. Week by week. All the same. It's Monday, then suddenly Friday. Then the weekend. Then Monday...repeat. I don't care about any of it. Monday, Wednesday, Sunday...whatever. All the same. 

The best part of my day is when I get to come home from work and have a binge and purge episode for like 2-3 hours. That's literally the most I look forward to. And even that is starting to fade out. 

Everything is faded. Everything is muted. At random times I explode, but then the monotony sets back in and I find myself almost in a stupor of some kind. 

My life is meaningless and I want it to be over. I don't want to commit suicide, I just want to not exist.",og9ont,1371,1.0,103,2021-07-08 15:35:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/og9ont/i_dont_want_to_kill_myself_i_just_dont_want_to/,False,False,2021,7

HES FUCKING SEVEN YEARS OLD AND HES FUCKING (*SHOWING SIGNS OF*) DEPRESSION ALREADY. My parents are neglectful and they did me the same way , the first time I knew I hated myself was around 9. How did they fuck up again. Fucking how.

Edit : sorry for ""diagnosing"" him with depression. Im obviously not qualified to do so , I made this post in tears after listening to him because he has the exact same mentality as I did and still do, and I am extremely depressed myself so I was pretty much hysterical.

10,How the fuck do people find things they actually like and stick with it??,"One of the big pieces of advice I see for depressed people online is to ""find a hobby"" or find something fulfilling. I can see how this would be a great piece of advice, if it actually worked for me. 

Any time I pick something new up, I kind of enjoy it, keep doing it for a few weeks (maybe even a month if I'm lucky), get bored and then stop. Rinse and repeat, every goddamn time. I've tried the gym, running, tennis, football, photography, hell even playing video games I get bored of eventually. 

Maybe it's because of my depression, but I really struggle to find something I actually enjoy to the point of wanting to do it as much as possible over a long period of time. Most things that I find which I genuinely enjoy, my enjoyment/determination fizzles out after a few weeks to the point where my effort put in outweighs my enjoyment so I just stop. How do people find things they enjoy and actually want to stick with it for a long period of time??

11,The cancer has spread to my liver,"Well it's most likely the cancer, anyways. The doctors like to make me feel better by saying there's a chance it'll be benign, but so far it never has been. Every test has come back as bad news, which just leads to more tests and more uncertainty. The pain in my hips has come back, and knowing I have a fresh mass in my liver that's already 5cm across....it freaks me out. It wasn't there when I had surgery in the beginning of may, which means it's spreading, and fast. I was feeling ok for a couple weeks, but the pain is coming back and I'm scared for the abdominal pain to come back...that was the worst. The hurt in my hip is like a constant dull ache that's always bothering me, but the pain in my abdomen was like always feeling like puking but never actually puking, along with stabbing pain if I moved wrong. I don't want that again. I even talked to my doctor about going back to work and she said go for it if I feel okay, but what if I don't actually feel okay? What if it just keeps getting worse? Will I ever be back to normal? Will I be able to go back to school in the fall? Will I be able to finish my degree or will the cancer completely derail the one goal I had finally started to crawl towards? I have a biopsy scheduled in 2 weeks and I'm scared for that; my first biopsy didn't give conclusive results that lead to 4 months of waiting for surgery bc no one thought it was serious. Im terrified of that happening again.

Im just so full of uncertainty and I'm scared and I feel like im not valid for feeling any of it. People have it worse than I do, so my brain tells me I don't get to be upset. But I am. But I don't want to be. I'm conflicted. I'm upset. I want to sleep so I don't have to feel.

Forgive the rant, but thank you if you read through my woes anyways.

Edit: I posted this without much thought last night in the middle of a break down and went right to sleep afterwards. I can't believe the amount of support people have shown me...im in shock.

By the year 2000 I was finishing High School I was going on 6 years of depression at that point and I already had a overdose suicide attempt a year prior. Now I'm 40 years old and it has been 26 years of depression I never accomplished anything in my life never even had a gf a complete absolute loser and now on top of that I have permanent neurological health problems that makes my life even worst it's not from my suicide attempt but something not related. I guess my point is depression made me lazy and a miserable bastard that never connected with the outside world it stoled my youth away something I can never have back. Living with regrets is just as bad as depression don't be me there is no recovering from lost time and permanent health issues plus clinical depression it's a living hell. All I can say is if you're still young and at least have your physical health you need to go and try your hardest to at least try to find happiness while you can. It may seem impossible but don't be a loser like me and quit right away keep on pushing while you can before it's to late.,p02ayx,1195,0.99,123,2021-08-07 21:58:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/p02ayx/depression_steals_your_youth_away/,False,False,2021,8

1,I feel like depression makes me see things for what they really are,"I feel like my depression takes away my brains ability to simply ignore all the countless problems in the world. 

The poverty, hunger, abuse, war, corruption... All of which could be significantly reduced if humanity wasn't so selfish, hurtful, weak and idiotic. 

The pointless grind of working terrible jobs just to survive. The futility of going after your dreams because none of them are likely to become a reality. The inevitability of pain and death for you and everyone around you, where the best case scenario is that you die quickly and are the first one to do so. 

Life is just a non-stop horror show. Depression doesn't make it seem like it, life actually IS terrible.

I give a 100% to every friendship I have and in return I get nothing.

I’m that therapist friend that always checks up on everyone but nobody checks up on me, and that’s so frustrating and painful.

6,Mom said I’m free to commit suic*de if I finished my study.,"I’ve been suffering from depression for more than 15 years and recently for many reasons it gets worse. In the year of 2017 my parents asked me to get a masters degree since my previous education was too bad, I successfully got enrolled but due to my mental health condition and my social phobia I feel it’s really hard for me to keep going, especially when I compare myself to other rich and happy schoolmates, I feel no motivation and no willing to focus on my study, I like it but it’s all because of my family wanted it, not me. I then realized that I haven’t done anything for my own good, I just fulfill other people’s wish all the time, this realization makes me frustrated and feeling hopeless and meaningless. So I’m being suicidal for some months. I talked to my mom last month, I said if I could quit, because I want to restart my own life and try to enjoy. I know I mess up my 31 year long life already since I don’t have a goal I am just being alive as my parents’ best obedient kid, I see no future, no meaning in my life so I want to give up, I feel so excited when thinking about death, a relief and a method to solve all the pains. 
I talked about these feelings with my mom and dad I hope they can be understanding and supportive but they said no, I can’t quit before I finish my school, also they said if I want to die, it’s better to finish my school first then I can die with a certificate, that at least makes them feel good that I did a thing.  

I really want to die as a revenge to them, they don’t care about me and my problem, they said if I die it’ll be a huge loss and shame for them, because their peers would really look down to them. But now they seem to know that my depression isn’t a made up excuse so they tried to negotiate with me, they literally said that I can kill myself if I could at least get the certificate, I really let them down all the time they said if I could try at least once?

I have no friends no relationship no one I could talk to with my problems but I don’t think anything will help me out. I’m just super suicidal I cry all day, I want to end everything but I hate my mom’s sad face and crying.",prq5jq,1169,0.99,125,2021-09-20 07:51:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/prq5jq/mom_said_im_free_to_commit_suicde_if_i_finished/,False,False,2021,9
7,I simply want to die,"No biggie. I’m not depressed, I like my life, I love my family, I have everything going well. Just starting my professional career, I make more money than most people my age, I’m in a relationship, I’m an attractive young woman and that’s it. But I still want to die.
I’m not depressed, I know a lot of people would miss me and I would destroy my parents if I actually tried to do anything. But none of this truly matters sometimes. I feel empty in a way I can’t put into words and I’m just looking for someone who can relate to this - lack of - feeling. I don’t want to actually pursue a career, I don’t feel motivated to do anything, I don’t see myself working as a teacher and actually being happy, but I also don’t see myself working with anything and being happy.
I just want it to stop. I don’t want to exist, to have to follow social rules, to be human. Sometimes I just feel like every action I make is forged and I’m just waking up everyday, putting on a mask or something and pretending I care about the world. I don’t. I think humans are as insignificant as ants, and that’s actually a beautiful thing. We’re bound to fulfill our duties, keep the engine working and then die.
I wish I could just unplug without hurting anyone, just vanish as if I’d never existed.
No one knows about how I feel, ‘cause I’m the only person who truly knows myself. I get everything done, but everything makes me exhausted. It’s like other people have it all figured out and I’m the only one who can’t bare having to do the simplest of tasks.

3,11yr old son came to me and said he had planned to shoot himself.,"Driving to soccer practice my son told me he had planned to sneak into my room and (somehow) unlock my safe and shoot himself. Then went on to say he no longer wanted to do it.  He cited rejection from kids at school as the main source of his sadness, but as his father I have a hard time not assigning blame to everything I can think of that I might have done differently. I have personally had suicidal ideation issues since about 12 but never gone as far as a plan to actualize those thoughts. Feeling as though I passed a torch but also telling myself that it is most likely other factors ( my therapist agrees with the latter). Any advice for helping a pubescent 11yr old, and not blaming myself for everything ?

Edit: update and more info. 
You guys this chat has been amazing! Thank you to everyone involved and that took time to post! Thought I would give more background to the situation that people have asked or talked about.

We learned he was having suicidal thoughts from his school. My wife is a fifth grade teacher and received a call from my sons school that he had texted another student and mentioned he was going to kill himself. The student told their parent the parent contacted the school.  My wife immediately left with her school counselor to pick him up and take him to her school. He wasn’t saying much and didn’t give any specifics to my wife about plans, just that what she was being told was true.
      That night is when he told me of his plan but that he didn’t want to do it anymore. My therapist said it would be a good idea to get the whole family involved for support, so we also had a family meeting with his two sisters letting them know what was happening. It went amazing and everybody had a good cry and let him know how much he meant to them and how much we would miss him. I also moved my gun safe out of the house to a family members.
   The next day my wife took him to school my with her and went to see the school counselor/licensed therapist. They talked about what was going on made a safety plan and talked about coping mechanisms for him.  He will be having sessions with her regularly. 
   We now have open communication with him about his anxiety/depression levels. His thoughts of suicide he says have been minimal. He did tell me during one talk “I don’t want to die, but my brain keeps telling me I do”. He’s an very emotionally sensitive and has always been. He takes things personally and rejection is amplified because of this. 
   I feel we have moved into a better space around the situation, and he is doing well.

2,My girlfriend of 4 years died 2 days ago and I feel alone,"Growing up I had never really been depressed and always tried to look at the positives, but 2 days ago I watched my girlfriend die.  She was my soul mate, we connected instantly when we met at work. I had currently been in a toxic relationship when we met so we didn't date until a year later. But we instantly became friends and after a little bit of drama we started dating.. but I knew by then that she was the one.  She understood me like nobody else and I understood her.  She was good at everything I struggled with and I was good at everything she struggled with. We never really fought we only slightly bickered from time to time but it was never anything serious.We were planning on finishing college and then we were gonna get married.  But we decided to go visit my family's cabin in the mountains with some friends, and on the way home my truck broke down. We called a tow and as he arrived we all stood in the ditch waiting for him to tow it.   Then a speeding car came rushing in and slid on the ice and hit me and my beautiful girlfriend.  Once I  woke up I immediately rushed to her but she was covered in blood and she wasn't breathing.  I tried to give her cpr but she was already gone and I can't stop seeing her cold lifeless face.  In those few seconds I lost my future and my other half. I feel so alone and don't really want to live anymore. I can't see a future without her in it, the thought never even once occurred to me.Because I know she was truly my soul mate, and I will never find anyone like her. I miss her smile and her goofy songs she would sing, I miss the way she would put her feet in between my legs before bed. I miss how she would force me to brush my teeth at night because I was being lazy. I just miss her so much and don't know what to do. And I want to believe that she is in heaven looking down on me but why would God take such a beautiful and loving girl away from me. I wish I had saved her, I wish I had jumped in front of her so I was gone and she could still be here.",rwaqiu,1539,0.99,146,2022-01-05 01:44:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rwaqiu/my_girlfriend_of_4_years_died_2_days_ago_and_i/,False,False,2022,1

4,"I hate how ""Go to therapy"", and ""Start exercising"" are thrown around like they are a magic pill.","Don't get me wrong many have benefited from this, but how many haven't?

It seems that for everyone these don't work they are followed with find a better therapist or working out will just release endorphins to make you feel better or some shit.

If only I had kept all the wasted money on therapy to pay 10 escorts instead, I'd be much better. Going to therapy just made me feel worse, no matter how many different I went to, and I tried group therapy once I felt better(which surprise surprise I got better when I wasn't going regularly to therapy) but that was a big mistake, group therapy fucked me up more, it just made me realize I'm actually even more alone in what I'm going through.

To sum up what was heard in therapy, ex promiscuous people who want love but regularly have sex complaining how they hate who they married and cheat on them acting like they understand the sturggle of a late virgin( I was 23 back then).

Oh and the workout part?

Instead of punching my head and hurting, I now punch myself and see stars and get fucking dizzy, working out just made me stronger not happier, endorphins don't hit me, I rest between sets punching my head.

All this stupid advice thrown everywhere made me even more miserable.

And the worst is how many act like they care about feelings but they're just virtue signalling, aka 99.9% of reddit.",s4rxox,1366,0.97,250,2022-01-15 19:22:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/s4rxox/i_hate_how_go_to_therapy_and_start_exercising_are/,False,False,2022,1
