0,ADHD is like everyone has to hold 100 marbles and you're the only one without a bag,"Youre trying to manage the same stuff everybody else is able to manage but marbles keep falling out of your hands. And neurotypical people are giving advice like ""well, why don't you just put them in your bag?"" BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A BAG. 

Maybe you're struggling to carry only 50 marbles, and you see people around you easily managing 150, which is bitterly discouraging.  But the fact that you can even hold on to that many is incredible BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE A BAG, BUT YOU'RE STILL TRYING.

Medication is like having a bag with a hole in it.  It's so much better than what you're used to so when you start using it you feel on top of the world. Then you notice that marbles are slowly falling out and you think ""what's the point, it's just as bad as before."" But you have to remember it's still worth it.

The worst thing you can do is trip on the marbles you've dropped. That's my biggest struggle. I focus on one little thing I've messed up and all of a sudden I've come crashing down and drop all the marbles I was able to hold minutes before. 

I don't really know where I'm going with this but as soon as I thought of the analogy I hyperfixated on it (of course) and had to share it. Hopefully this helps you in some way, maybe as a way to explain ADHD to people who don't get it.

Edited to add: Not everyone wants/needs meds, and that's fine! The ""bag with a hole"" can represent whatever coping mechanism fits you best (eg therapy).

2nd Edit: to those asking if they can ""steal"" this, no you can't because I'm freely giving it to you. ;) Do with it what you will, no credit necessary.

0,A Message to the ADHD Community (serious),"I'm the father of an 11 year old boy with ADHD.  I don't remember the exact year that my wife and I had him diagnosed, but I always knew he had it.  My wife didn't always know, but that's a long story for another post.

Many of you are probably wondering what the point of this post is.  Maybe I am too.  But I have been lurking here occasionally, and some of the stories I read break my heart.

So here's my message to this community...


It's okay.  

It's okay that I asked you to take out the trash and you forgot.  It's just trash.

It's okay that sometimes you're late for school, and sometimes you forget to bring your homework home.  What I care about are the other times.  The times you come home happy that you made a new friend, or that you got an A.  Or a B.  Or a C.  It's just school.

It's okay that you are sometimes irritable.  Irritating.  Infuriating.  You're also kind.  Humble.  Caring.  Amazing.  Beautiful.  And that's more than just okay.

It's okay that sometimes you're a little hard to follow.   That sometimes you talk about three different things at once.  I wish I knew as much as you, that I had the passion that you have about the things that excite you.  

It's okay if you choose to take medication to make your life easier.  Don't like meds?  That's okay too.

The point is this.  You are all wonderful, beautiful, amazing people.  You come from all walks of life.   You've all taken a different path.  Just know that there are people who care about you.  There are people who get you.  There are people who love you, and want you to be happy.

It will be okay.

2,Do any young (or not young) people with ADD feel terrified at the prospect of working 8 hours a day straight for the next 40 years???,"Anyone else feel free to chime in here as well, not just young folks!! I just graduated college and I'm working my first 9-5 with an Americorps position so it's not a really traditional job, and it has a set end date as it's only a year contract. Something I'm really struggling with is being efficient and productive under the 9-5 model; if all I have to do for a whole day is answer one email, I will not do so until 4:50. Sometimes I'll even do it from home that night. 

I really struggle with identifying what I can see myself doing career wise for the rest of my life; I love what I do now, and I feel like my ADD still manages to make it really miserable to get through to day. Indecision one of the biggest debilitating factors that I deal with as a result of my ADD, and I find myself anxious and paralyzed over the concept of picking a career when I can't see myself doing anything for 8 hours a day every day!! How do I know what I want to do with my life when it feels like my brain chemistry isn't conducive to the 9-5 work day?? 

I don't shy from work; I have worked a lot throughout the years both in a workplace context and school context. When I was in college I would spend more than 8 hours a day working on schoolwork at times, but it was different; it felt unstructured and unsupervised and on my own prerogative so it was ok that I was spaced out for most of it.

Anyone ever feel this way? Any older adults with a career have any advice? Anyone want an internet hug??

3,3 Things Nobody Explained to me About ADHD.,"I recently listened to an ADHD podcast where a psychiatrist spoke at length about ADHD and in a nutshell this is what he said. 

There are 3 pieces of ADHD:

1. **People with ADHD have a nervous system that works perfectly well.** He never found anything they couldn‚Äôt do. But it works on the basis of interest, challenge, novelty, urgency (and perhaps passion). It doesn‚Äôt work at all on importance, rewards, and consequences (which is what ‚Äúneurotypical‚Äù brains respond to) 

2. **Rejection sensitive dysphoria.** Intense emotional response to the perception (not necessarily the reality) of rejection, teasing, or criticizing by others. 

3. **Internal sense of hyperarousal.** Moods created by ADHD are almost always triggered by events and perceptions, and resolve very quickly. They are normal moods in every way except for their intensity.

I hope this provides you some insight like it did for me. 

Take care all. 

EDIT: I can‚Äôt mention the name of the podcast, because as someone else tried, automod will delete it. The guest psychiatrist was William Dodson, MD.  

EDIT2: Maybe it‚Äôs the internal sense of hyperarousal, lol, but I‚Äôm tearing up over here about the Platinum. I made this post to share information that made sense to me, and hearing other people in the comments have the same response I initially did fills my heart. Then, platinum? I‚Äôm very grateful. 

**EDIT3:** /u/EricKow was able to listen to the podcast and **explain #1 a bit better:**

* Omnipotential - ADHD people can do anything if they can get engaged enough

* Insensitivity to importance as a motivator",asmlxq,2677.0,0.99,405.0,2019-02-20 10:02:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/asmlxq/3_things_nobody_explained_to_me_about_adhd/,0.0,0.0,,

3,Having ADHD means planning extremely well and executing abysmally bad.,"I guess that is why people generally find my advice much helpful.

Edit : Thank you kind strangers for the gold & silver.
I've noticed that some people are saying that they are not good planners and that they execute best at the last minute. I find that relatable, even though I think of myself as a good planner. The most productive and noteworthy things I've been able to accomplish were all unplanned and kinda pushed on me. I think all ADHD people live by the motto, ""If tomorrow isn't the due date, today isn't the do date"". 
Reading comments from you all makes me think that I am reading about myself just on different days of the week. I can literally relate to everything you all are saying.

2,"*taps mic* IF YOU BEAT YOURSELF UP FOR NOT STICKING WITH HOBBIES OR GET DISCOURAGED ABOUT STARTING NEW ONES, READ THIS!","I read and responded to a post on this topic yesterday and OP from that post recommended that I make my comment a post of its own. After all the times I've been helped by this community, this finally feels like my opportunity to give back. Here goes! \*cracks knuckles\*

&#x200B;

So I've been struggling with this lately myself. I've been wanting to learn the guitar for literally years but never had the money to buy one. Now that I have the money to do it I keep getting cold feet and thinking, ""Oh man, I know I'm not gonna be able to stick with it so it's not even worth buying."" But f\*ck it. I'm gonna buy it! Here's how I came to that decision.

&#x200B;

**\*\*1. Be kind to yourself!\*\***

Obviously, #1 universal rule of ADHD, applicable to all scenarios. Self-loathing sucks. Do your best to be kind to yourself. I recently came across the term ""self-compassion"", which I really like. Be at least as nice to yourself as you'd be to other people. You wouldn't make fun of/beat up a loved one who switches hobbies often, so don't do it to yourself!

&#x200B;

**\*\*2. Emphasize dynamic hobbies.\*\***

Someone in yesterday's thread used the phrase ""dynamic hobbies"" and I think that's a god damn genius phrase. We need hobbies that we can pick up for a month or two at a time and completely forget for another few months. That's just how my/our hobbies work! We just need to accept that and choose compatible hobbies. Last month I got *obsessed* with freshwater aquariums. Watched a ton of YouTube videos, went to Petco to scout potential fish, etc. Even bought a fancy ass $100+ fish tank from Amazon! Then I realized that this is \*not\* a dynamic hobby. Forgetting/not caring about my aquarium for months will result in dead fish. **\*ERROR 404: INCOMPATIBLE HOBBY!\*** Fish tank was subsequently returned.

Relatedly, I had a plant in my bedroom that I needed to water every day or few days. That plant is dead as hell. I now have one of those plants that you only need to remember to water once a month (snake plant, if you're wondering!). Plant is thriving! Lol

As far as hobbies go, guitar is super dynamic! If I learn 3 songs this month and no songs for the next two months, no one dies!

&#x200B;

**\*\*3. Reset your expectations.\*\***

Listen, I know myself. I am not about to practice diligently every day for the next year and be performing at local bars in 2 years. That'd be great, but it's a pipe dream. If I define that as the goal, I'm going to fall short and feel shitty. Instead, I'm going to focus on being able to strum a couple songs here and there when I'm bored and maybe learn one song for my girlfriend that I can use to score some romantic brownie points on a birthday/anniversary. That's it. Anything else is icing on the cake. If I do actually end up learning guitar for real, awesome! If I don't, awesome! The point here is to add something to my life that brings me joy, and dammit, strumming along to a song with 4 basic chords from time to time gives me joy! Don't squeeze all the joy out of it by putting too many expectations on it or on yourself.

&#x200B;

**\*\* 4. Reduce the barriers to exit (specifically financially).\*\***

You've heard of ""barriers to entry""? Well, allow me to introduce you to a new concept: barriers to exit. Super important. Recognize and accept that your new ""hobby crush"" may fade with time. When I get excited about a new hobby I am super tempted to buy professional-grade stuff. MISTAKE! When entering a new hobby, recognize that it may not last and make it as easy as possible to get out of financially -- meaning it won't be too much of a loss if (when) you give it up. When starting a new hobby that requires purchasing things, try to force yourself to only purchase entry level stuff until the hobby has stuck around for long enough to justify investing in. Or buy things that can easily be resold on the internet. Entry level DSLR camera that can be resold if you decide you hate photography? Fine. Professional grade DLSR camera engraved with your first and last name and therefore with limited resale value? Not fine. Not fine at all.

This month I started a new workout class. Went to the first class and loved it! Was ready to purchase the $200 month unlimited monthly membership for 12 months! Yay! Then a little voice said, ""Hey man, remember to reduce the barriers to exit. You might not like this next month."" So instead I bought the $50 entry-level package and will re-evaluate my commitment as I go. If it doesn't stick, it won't nearly be as much of a loss!

&#x200B;

**\*\* 5. Don't try harder, try differently!\*\***

Also a foundational ADHD rule. But relevant in literally every scenario...including this one! When it comes to a new hobby, you may need to outsource your executive function to a teacher or class (if you can afford it!). Example: I've had a regular gym membership for 6 months and literally only gone 1 single time. It's just too much to actually figure out what workouts I am supposed to be doing, keep myself accountable to the time set for each exercise, etc. Also tbh it's honestly kind of boring. I signed up for a workout class last week. The only thing I need to do is show up. They already have the exercises planned so I don't need to think about it. And it's a group class so there's constant motivation to push myself from peers. I have exercised 5 times in the last 7 days! That's like an infinity percent improvement from my previous strategy. I would never have gotten there if I was just trying ""harder"" at a strategy that didn't work for me.

&#x200B;

**\*\* 6. Trying new hobbies is a hobby unto itself!\*\***

What is the definition of a hobby? Something you do for fun. Some people collect stamps for fun. Other people watch birds for fun. Others make scrapbooks. You know what I do? TRY NEW HOBBIES! I get pleasure from getting excited about a random thing and diving into it a month at a time. Trying new hobbies is my hobby! No sense in feeling guilt or shame about it when it makes me so god damn happy!

This is a subtle but ***really important*** reframing. Person X would say, ""I collect stamps for fun. Last year I found a rare limited edition 1956 stamp from Montana and a couple from California in the 1760s! I loved it!"" I would say, ""I try new hobbies for fun. Last year I dabbled in photography, guitar, and dog sitting! I loved it!"" Both of us would be having fun doing what we do. Person X would never feel bad about him or herself for not trying ""enough"" new things, so why would I ever feel bad about trying ""too many"" new things?!

&#x200B;

**\*\*TL;DR:\*\*** Be kind to yourself. Accept that your hobbies will have to be dynamic. Instead of trying harder, consider trying differently. Reduce the (financial) barriers to exit. And, most importantly, recognize that trying new hobbies \*is\* a hobby! Godspeed, mateys. Happy hobbying!

Bring the mattresses inside the house.

2,"This is how people with ADHD can work twice as long, work 3x faster, complete more than 5x the amount of tasks, see over 1000% more detail...and still feel like crap for not getting anything done.","Here‚Äôs an example I use to explain to others what happens when I‚Äôm tasked with something. Over the years ‚Äútask‚Äù has meant: homework, housework, work assignments, group tasks, personal hobbies, fill in the blank...  

##Situation #1:

*Say you ask someone (neurotypical) to do ‚ÄúTask A‚Äù, you need it done in 3 hours.*

They look at it and see about 10 steps needed complete it. They work for 2 hours and get 9 of those 10 done. ‚ÄúGood enough‚Äù, they think. In their mind, they‚Äôre ending with a mental todo list 90% finished. They go relax for an hour.

If they got a grade? A-. They walk away feeling good having finished a task and doing it pretty well.

###*So: 9 out of 10 tasks in 2 hours. That‚Äôs roughly one task every 15 mins to get 90% done and an hour to relax. Internal score: A-*


##Now, Situation #2:

*You ask me (ADHD, 2e) to do ‚ÄúTask A‚Äù:*

I look and see 100 possible details. I catch a vision of what ‚ÄúTask A‚Äù could be, and am extremely excited by it. I see how ‚ÄúTask A‚Äù fits into other Tasks (B, C, D, E, F), and how it makes them easier for other people. ‚ÄúTask A‚Äù if done right, can support itself, help the people who need to do it after me and potentially generate enough resources to create new Tasks (W!?, X!?, Y!?...dare I say, even Z!?) Man, if I can get this done ‚ÄúTask A‚Äù will be incredible. This feeling...it‚Äôs electric. 

At first glance I can see at least 9 details related to, and needing accounted for, each of the original 10 steps. I‚Äôm unfamiliar with a couple of the details, so I‚Äôll need to do some research to resolve my questions. What‚Äôs more, there are irrelevant details buried in the pile, but I don‚Äôt know which ones yet, so I‚Äôll need to be actively sifting those out while I work.

For the next 4 hours I work on it like crazy, riding the wave of my excitement. Guided by the image in my head, I‚Äôm working hard to get it done. But, because of distractibility, I get sidetracked other random tasks.  Add to that I‚Äôve come up with 10-20 more unforeseen and potentially irrelevant details. It‚Äôs okay though, I‚Äôm getting momentum and really starting to weave the threads together. 

My focus is having holes poked in it because people keep interrupting me. It‚Äôs not malicious, they are just being friendly by saying ‚ÄúHi‚Äù, or trying to get me to smile because I look so intense. They don‚Äôt know how hard I‚Äôm holding my focus together, and that every distraction is like a wind gust against my attentional house of cards. There‚Äôs been some unravelling, but I try to shake off my anger and get back to reweaving them quickly. 

I‚Äòve been working at a pace of about one task every 5 mins. I look up and realize its been 4 hours, ‚Äúcrap!‚Äù I‚Äôm an hour over. I take stock of where I‚Äôm at. I have crossed 48 tasks off my mental todo list of (now) 120, but am only about 40% finished. That‚Äôs a big mental ‚ÄúF‚Äù (in more ways than one).

###*So: 48 of 120 tasks in 4 hours. One task every 5 minutes and only 40% done. Score: F*

**This is how people with ADHD can work twice as long, work 3x faster, complete more than 5x the amount of tasks, see over 1000% more detail...and still feel like crap for not getting anything done.**

Okay...I try to take stock of where I am. At the pace I was going, it will take me 10 hours to finish. The break has made me realize I haven‚Äôt eaten. I‚Äôm starting to feel bad. I‚Äôm mentally exhausted and my brain is fried. I‚Äôm way over my deadline and it was needed an hour ago. At this stage its not even finished enough to be usable. 

This isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened, far from it, so now I‚Äôm also feeling defeated. I also feel demotivated because I don‚Äôt actually know how much longer its going to take me to finish, so I engage in procrastination as a stress relief tool. 

Now I‚Äôm working much slower, because experiencing this pattern is what kickstarts a depression. ‚ÄúThis always happens...‚Äù I look at what I still need to do. It‚Äôs likely going to take me a possible 50+ hours to work through the remaining 72 tasks I FEEL need to get done. The end of the task stretches away toward the horizon, like a long, vast road. *‚ÄùMan, this sucks...‚Äù*. Every minute I continue is a slog that drags me down further. But it has to get done...

I stay up all night working on it. The silence and lack of interruption helps, but it‚Äôs still slow.

...In the morning come the text messages.  People asking me questions about the task. Some innocuous, *‚ÄúHey, just checking on the status of ‚ÄúTask A‚Äù?‚Äù*, some not, *‚ÄúHey we NEED ‚ÄúTask A‚Äù to be done as soon as possible, we have people waiting on it. When will you be done?‚Äù* I feel shame.

An immediate dread that feels like daggers. Stress. Cortisol and adrenaline coursing through my body like a weird familiar fire. And then, an immediate dive into a full depression. 

I feel they are justified in their frustration. I‚Äôm frustrated with me too. 

*‚ÄúWhy does this always happen?‚Äù*    
*‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I just get things done?‚Äù*    
*‚ÄúWhy is this so hard for me when it‚Äôs so easy for other people?‚Äù*    
*‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I just think more simply?‚Äù*    

And then to add to the heartbreak, *‚ÄúMan, this could be so useful, and so great...if I could just get it done.‚Äù*

‚Äú...‚Äù

*‚Äú...I suck.‚Äù*    
*‚Äú...I hate this feeling.‚Äù*    
*‚Äú...I wish I wasn‚Äôt such a failure.‚Äù*    


It‚Äôs a strange thing we have. It‚Äôs the source of my creativity and wonder. And also the source of my darkest times. That feeling fades, and some things get better. But this pattern seems to be close at all times.

I feel like I‚Äôm always trying to defend why ‚Äúcreative‚Äù people seem to struggle getting things done. While it‚Äôs exacerbated by ADHD, it is also a problem with creative types. While they are commonly judged as flaky or undisciplined, I really think it has to do with the challenge of having more dots to connect than the average person. And then having to deal with the mental repetitive stress injuries that come from weathering other‚Äôs lack of understanding. Which then only reflexes back onto the problem like a serpent that is eating its own tail.",bq3ywt,2895.0,0.99,298.0,2019-05-18 13:24:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bq3ywt/this_is_how_people_with_adhd_can_work_twice_as/,0.0,0.0,,

I remember lots of people asking for an update, so here it is:

(Sorry if this sounds a little off, English is my third language). I listened to what everyone said and I really, really appreciated the advice. After taking the time to calm down, I screenshotted all of his emails to show how he was lying and changing my grade (he changed it 6 different times to make it seem like I was failing even more!) and trying to manipulate me into re-taking his course, as well as emails where he contradicts things that he had told me in the past. I attached all those screenshots to a long, long email calling him out professionally as well as explaining my side of things. I also went as far as rhetorically questioning a lot of his statements in an effort to emphasize how callous and unreasonable he was being, so that not only can he process exactly what he's been telling me and reflect on it, but also for others reading the email as well. I attached my disability counsellor, him, the chair running the department, and the coordinator of the program. Within an hour, he sent a rushed email saying he didn't want to deal with this, then another email an hour later trying to save himself. I didn't say anything and let the emails sit. 2 days later, I received an email back from him saying he was talked to by his bosses and that they've decided to pass me for his class, along with an apology for how insensitive and harsh he was being. Yay!! So glad I stood up for myself this time and I encourage anyone else to 100% do the same!

Edit: Jesus, I didn't think this would blow up so much. Thanks for all the comments, I'm glad I'm not the only one struggling with this!

1,"Everyone, repeat after me: ""Forgetting is not the same thing as not caring enough to remember""","We forget things that we genuinely care about. Hell, we forget about things that we *ourselves* are interested in. There's no controlling who it happens to or what it's about. If it can be remembered, it can also be forgotten. Meds don't give us perfect memory.

Don't shame yourself for forgetting, it happens (a lot). Do the best that you can to resolve the problem and make the best of it.

Edit 1: Holy shit this blew up. I'm glad I was a source of much needed validation of your experiences and reality, guys.

Also, just a fun note, this post was inspired by the constant misunderstanding that neurotypical people seem to have about us when it comes to remembering. They don't realize that our brains just *refuse* to recall information, regardless of the time span between receiving it and trying to recall it.

My wife was unfortunately one of these people until I just showed her this post and the comments. You guys helped my wife understand what's really going on. She said she won't ever get mad at me for forgetting and to remind her of this post when she does. Thank you guys for that!

Featuring all your favorites:

-A handful of chips!

-A spoonful of peanut butter!

-Cold hotdogs!

-Those leftovers from a few days ago, also cold!

-Just bread!
