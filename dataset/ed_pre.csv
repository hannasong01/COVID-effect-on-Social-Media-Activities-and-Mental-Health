0,"Request: Obese to underweight, recognize problems, fail to adhere to regular diet. Sidebar is ovewhelming.","In November of 2016, I read about a man who had lost weight by eating one meal daily. The article was very well written, and also made sense back then, it went somewhere along the lines of, as long as most of your needs are met, eating one huge meal and supplements and eating six carefully planned meals at a caloric deficit makes no difference. I had had enough of being fat for most of my life and I wanted to change, for myself, and nobody else. Was 19 at the time, am 21 now, a guy all the time, if this info is necessary.

By October I was comfortable with having whatever was being served at my Uni cafeteria and some dark chocolate to go with my afternoon coffee, vitamin supplements and nothing else throughout the day. The only time I deviated from this plan was when I had some drinks with friends and a couple of times during the holidays last year. As you might imagine the weight loss was noticeable, compliments were flying, and, because the only meal I had throughout the day was a social one, nobody suspected a thing. But, as with anything, I started obsessing about my weight loss, the compliments felt good, and I wanted more. It started with cutting the extra meat from my meal, then cutting the dessert from that one meal, then cutting the dessert, then the bread, then the chocolate alongside my coffee, and then I started being picky about the meat and side dish itself, as in, no more lasagna, no more fried stuff, and so on. It ended with cutting everything but meat, veggies, fruit, being picky about the pasta and rice, I even cut the freaking soup, and the only drinks I ever had were either coffee (as black as my soul, not even with stevia), tea and water.

The year went by, as went my kilos, and my mental state. By July I had lost a small child worth of weight, and my mind. Having not realized it at the time, I was basically a vegetable. I would come home from class and waste my time watching YouTube or TV shows from my childhood (I mention this because it probably had a calming effect, reminiscing about a time I did not have to care about anything other than missing Ned'd declassified and Zoey 101, actually, Nick in general and whichever video game I had been playing at the time), because there is Bob's burgers only once per week. Like lie in my bed, and not do anything else, not only did I stop studying, i stopped playing video games dammit, did not hang out with friends, hell, the only social interaction I ever did was lying to my parents about why I failed another exam. After failing most of my exams I came home for the summer. My parents had known how I lost the weight but didn't express any concern until they had actually seen how big of an idiot I am. Some stern talks, expresses for concern, some fighting and a lot of crying (mostly me) later, as in, some combination of that daily, for a few weeks, I have realized the errors in my ways. I probably wouldn't even have done that, but while we were at the seaside I managed to lose a significant chunk of weight as swimming and not eating make you do that, and that was when shit hit the fan.

As most of us know, the sight of ones mother crying because of ones actions can prompt absolutely anything and I had decided to return to a regular diet and make as much right as I could. And this is where the current problem starts. I had to return to uni because I still had the possibility to pass everything I had failed until then. I adhered to a strict five meal diet during the three and a half weeks I spent at uni basically only eating, studying, and the occasional walk, managed to pass everything but one and returned home triumphant, yeah, not quite. I had not gained any weight. Cue crying, accusations, and a bad atmosphere. I had some two weeks at home before the new semester, and they notice I eat regularly, but at the time something else became abundant. I did not know what to eat as I didn't want to gain all my weight back, a problem I did not deal with at Uni because I had bigger things to worry about. So I became picky, 5 meals but, not this, not that, not that either, only black coffee, tea, water, rice cakes instead of bread, etc.

And this is the problem I am still facing four months later. By now I am still worried about what I eat, will not eat anything I can't log into MyFitnessPal, will have multiple meals, but sometimes just two, sometimes six, ranging from big meals to ""basically not a meal"" kind of meals, and even then I restrict the number of calories I eat, and have started exercising using the 30 day fitness app, but have stopped because Uni is hell atm. But because I stopped exercising I also stopped eating that much, restricting my calorie intake even further. I ate my ass off during the holidays, but still gained only 2 kilos in three weeks. Am thinking about foods constantly, obssesion comes to mind. Sometimes I overeat for a meal and eat only fruit/veggies for the rest of the day or the next day to compensate. I've noticed I am cold all the freaking time and, my sex drive is nonexistent, like, I don't even take care of myself anymore. Motivation is all over the place, as you can see by the bad post, or, the decline in quality and details from start to end.

I am crying as I write this, I do not know what to do, or where to go, or who to talk to. I don't want to burden my parents as they have enough on their mind right now. I just want to return to a regular normal diet, and life. What kind of freaking ED do I have, how do I fix it, what, when and how much should I eat as to maintain current weight? Do I just start an x calorie diet and stick to it, do I work up to it, do I lay on the bed and cry? Do I provide some extra detail for you to figure out? Or do I just talk to a professional? Do people do counseling for free?

0,Request: Reddit is enabling my eating disorder,"I was set off by a specific comment that I read on a specific sub dedicating to a more intense diet regime. There's nothing wrong with dieting this way, but recently there has been scrutiny of the sub because of that fact that it harbors many people with eating disorders. There's on particular comment, very well upvoted, that says that nobody who really has anorexia would eat anywhere near around x (a low number) calories.

That low number of calories got me to a dangerously low BMI. It led to anemia, syncope, obsession, c/s, and yes, an anorexia diagnosis.

But no, ~real~ anorexics eat *even fewer*, always. I was just disciplined enough to eat x calories, right?

I was doing so well with my recovery. But if people think that my habits are normal dieting behavior, even when your BMI started out low, what am I recovering from?

I've read similar comments in other subs. It seems like my behavior has never been disordered.

0,Request: A little tip for anyone recovering from anorexia: make a video,"Back in 2016 when I was at my anorexic worst (BMI in the danger zone, exercising compulsively, etc.), I decided to make a video.

Here's what I did: I stuck my webcam on, started recording, took my top and jeans off so I was just in my underwear (bear with me), and did a little turn for the camera.

It served a few purposes—such as acting as a good way to determine how much healthier I looked and to document the recovery process—but now it serves one I hadn't anticipated.

It's not a magic switch, but now, every time I think about skipping a meal, I play that video. And holy shit does it work wonders sometimes. Skeletor Me is sad and very shocking to look at and I nearly teared up when I re-watched it yesterday, but I suppose that's the point: a shock to the system, a reminder that one skipped meal is where it starts.

And y'know, maybe I'll summon the required balls to eat something and still have trouble actually holding it down, but it's the effort of trying now that leads to the resilience built in the future. It doesn't work every time, it's not a magic Cura spell, but for the most part it acts as a great deterrent against skipping meals. As if to say, 'Remember this? Yeah, me too. Let's not do that shit again, yeah? Be brave, knobhead'.

Just an idea. One that's saved me more than a few times since then. Good luck with the rest of your journey xx",8mmvnf,63.0,0.98,9.0,2018-05-28 02:52:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/8mmvnf/request_a_little_tip_for_anyone_recovering_from/,0.0,0.0,2018.0,5.0
1,Request: How do you stop thinking constantly about the calories in food?,"How do you stop thinking constantly about the calories in food? If i look at an apple I just think 60 calories, if I look at a cup of yogurt I think 120 calories. I'm constantly doing math in my head and constantly worried about my intake. I'm sure this is just a part of having disordered eating (I've never been diagnosed, but I've always been obsessive). Any tips on how to work through this and eventually move on would be amazing. Some things I'm trying and they're sort of working (except I still do the math) are mindful eating, and allowing myself to have treats because I do workout and know that I need to eat more.

2,"Request: Recovered anorexic, now objectively overweight, advice on how to lose the weight and not relapse","I would consider myself recovered/in recovery from anorexia for the last fifteen years. I’ve been married for nine years to an amazing cook and have gained weight. Enough that my doctor nags me about losing weight - so between that and the scale, I feel like I have objective data.

For the last month, I’ve been doing a lot of strength training and cardio. I’ve started to run again, I can tell that my endurance is better, and am see actual muscle definition. All of which is awesome.

The food is more of a challenge - I am trying to make healthy food decisions, work on reasonable portions,etc. I am terrified that I will over restrict and there are days when I hear that voice creeping into my head.

I can’t find any studies or objective data about people in recovery trying to lose weight via healthy choices.

Does anyone have sage advice on how to stay on track with recovery while simultaneously staying on track with a healthy weight loss plan??

0,Request: Recovery Finally,"My wife has had an ED since she was 13.

We’ve had a hard road with it, but she’s resisted a intensive treatment. We tried very hard for years to “do it ourselves”, but at best had moderate success, usually temporary.

She finally kind of hit rock bottom, and agreed to go into an inpatient program about 3 weeks ago. She’s been taking it incredibly seriously, and is working harder on this than she has on anything else I’ve seen her do. She looks, sounds, and feels alive for the first time in a long time.

It’s lonely, but we have visiting hours about 4 days a week. The program is lovely, and provides great support.

Tangentially, we closed on a house at the same time, and so she’s excited to not have to move, but also, I’m excited she gets a clean break and a new start. The night before being admitted was the last time she will ever be in the old place.

She’s described her ED as almost its own entity, and kind of like a voice in her head. For years “it was [her] only friend.” I’ve told her this is a demon, it will say anything to kill her. Today she gets her first pass and will see the new place all moved into. We are going to sage the house; we are going to exorcise that motherfucker.

1,Request: Food Is Ruling My Life And I Can No Longer Tell When I'm Hungry,"So I've have disordered eating on and off for years. Lately though, I will barely eat anything all day and then have a big meal at the end of the day. I have no problem eating out at restaurants, which I go to with friends and my boyfriend a lot, but it's really hard for me to eat when I'm alone at home. This past week I have been completely exhausted, no matter how much I sleep. I also am training for a half marathon and sometimes don't have enough energy to run.

I can't tell the difference anymore between being hungry and just psychologically wanting to eat. It really scares me. I'm not losing that much weight, so I don't think I'm under-eating by that much. I'm thin but in the normal range. But eating alone has become really stressful and is consuming all my thoughts.

What type of help should I look for? I don't want to gain any weight, but I also don't want to live like this anymore.

2,Request: My Thoughts On The Morning Following Christmas Dinner,"It’s the morning after my family’s christmas dinner. I ate a lot, and as much as I wish I could’ve eaten a smaller amount of food, and ate only until fullness- I didn’t. I was looking around for posts about overeating on Holidays so I could feel less alone and there aren’t too too many. Last night, I felt slightly crazy going back for more and more bites of cake on top of having way too many cookies, whilst everybody else just had one piece. I felt guilty and thought people were probably judging me. Holidays are scary- You have the appetizers, the main, the bread and cheese, the dessert, the drinks. It’s terribly hard not to overeat. It’s like I can’t tell if this was a binge or not. But despite last night- I will still eat breakfast and continue my day as normal. I don’t feel too guilty and even though I ate more food than I can even remember, I didn’t feel sick and uncomfortably after my meal which is a success in my eyes. I’ve got ANOTHER family get together tonight, I will try to focus more on being with my family rather than the food. I’m starting to realize that overeating on holidays is pretty normal- one or a few days of doing it will not wreck me or make me spiral. Next time I will try to do better but I have to stop beating myself up. Also I found that is has helped me to think about old times and realize that I don’t remember what I ate. Even though I put so much importance to what I consume on a given day, it slips my mind and I only remember the interactions, the people, what I did... I don’t know. I also like to tell myself that I have eaten this much before, maybe more and I was FINE. 

I will be okay. You will be okay.

0,Request: Coping With Rude Comments On Weight Gain,"I’ve been struggling with ED since I was 15. I’m 32 and it is a lot better now with tremendous support from my partner but yesterday one of my students told me “Wow! You’ve gotten fat!!!”. She did it in front of other people, loudly. I had been really sick for 1,5 months, this was my first day at work and she really caught me off guard. I think people here will understand the effect of such words: this phrase triggered me very similarly to that first meltdown when I was a teenager and I had a very painful flashback yesterday. Now I am swinging back and forth between hating myself and wanting to hurt her in a similar way. Neither is healthy, of course.

2,Request: Date Ideas? Guy (25M) Asking Girl (27F) Out On Date.," 

I met this amazing girl (27F) and what initially attracted me to her was her personality. I (25M) met her through a mutual friend. Interestingly, every time I talk to her (even if we haven’t seen each other for weeks) there’s a chemistry between us and even our friends have pointed it out. The conversations just flow ya know?

She recently posted on her IG that she has been battling with her ED (specifically Bulimia) for 5-6 years. This made me want to look more into resources to understand ED and how to support someone with Bulimia.

Victory! So over a year into recovery from AN/ARFID I finally sold off my high end designer teeny tiny clothes. I'd been hoarding them and struggling to let go while accepting that they represent a really sick, sad, lonely part of my life and I will never fit them again. I feel like this is the final step in accepting, with joy, that I will never be that tiny size again and *I don't want* to be that size again. No one in my personal life knows about my ED recovery journey, so I'm sharing with you lovely people here. It is possible to let go of ED and be happy at a healthy weight. I'm so proud of myself right now. A year ago I could never have done this, and if I did it would have been through sobs and self hatred. But today I am so happy and grateful to have cleansed my closet of these unhealthy reminders. Thanks so much for reading. I wish you all the same success, health, and happiness in your ED recoveries as well.

2,"Request: Friends threw me an intervention, berated me, belittled me, guilted me, then dropped me as their friend after forcing me to disclose my darkest secret","Big rant. Sorry in advance.

&#x200B;

So I have a 16 year old eating disorder (strictly non-purging anorexia) schizoaffective (bipolar 2 subtype), severe depression, anxiety, and OCD. I’m currently in a serious relapse with my ED and my weight is way down.

&#x200B;

Recently I was (am) fairly suicidal. I only told one person. She met me with compassion and understanding. She provided me amazing nonjudgmental support when I shared my feelings. She also is supportive (in a helpful way) of my attempts at recovery.

&#x200B;

However, then a group of my other friends noticed I wasn’t doing too hot, and then figured out how hard I was struggling and decided to throw me an intervention; alone, three inexperienced women who know nothing about mental illness, and no professional insight or support.

&#x200B;

They sat me down and berated me for an hour and a half. That I’m bad for not opening up to them. They’re mad that I’m still struggling. I should be getting better faster. I’m not doing enough to help myself. I should have reached out to them first.

&#x200B;

Like.

&#x200B;

1. Truly depressed people with mental illness on the verge of suicide seldom reach out. So don’t get fucking OFFENDED when you find out I didn’t tell you. Maybe you should feel like..what could I have done better for D to trust us? They NEVER text me first. Ever. So why would i share my suicidal ideation with them??

&#x200B;

2. Recovery isn’t a straight line and nobody’s fucking perfect. Yeah, I’ve been struggling consistently for about a year, but like..it’s not my FAULT. I have multiple mental illnesses and they all aggravate the others. It’s out of my god damn control.

&#x200B;

3. Don’t berate the person you’re trying to “support.” Beating down on someone (with no moderator!!) will, in fact, make whatever the bigger issue is, worse.

&#x200B;

4. Don’t pretend you know what you’re doing!! The first thing one of them said was, “so we’ve never done this, and we have no idea what we’re doing, but here goes!” Interventions are DANGEROUS if not done correctly.

&#x200B;

5. Have a fucking goal at least!! They didn’t even have a desired outcome of the intervention. They had no plan. No follow through. I don’t even know what they expected from me. I think they just wanted me to agree with them, apologize for not telling them, and then listen to their every piece of advice and treat it like it was made of gold.

&#x200B;

6. They told me that my therapist must be really bad. They said I needed to fire her and find someone new. Or see two therapists. Which is SOOOOOOOOOOOO unethical to each therapist! No better way to get two sets of instructions and accidentally fuck it up. (For me anyway)

&#x200B;

7. Do not EVER tell someone who is suicidal your personal stories of loss. Jesus Christ. Really?? I want to die and you’re GUILTING ME? Fuck dude really? My best friend passed from suicide in 2012. I’m still fucking demolished over it, not to mention the three other friends who have gone that way. I do NOT need to be told about the affects of suicide on friends and family. I’ve experienced more loss via suicide than all three of them together. So don’t fucking give me the guilt trip.

&#x200B;

They literally had no clue what they were doing. And for some reason i just sat there and took it. Before the intervention they said that if I don’t do it they won’t hang out with me anymore.

&#x200B;

Then here we are two days later and one of them tells me I’m toxic and that she doesn’t want to know me anymore. UH OKAY. So fucking traumatize me, berate me, make me feel worthless, then bail out.

&#x200B;

Okay. Gotcha.

&#x200B;

So here I am now, picking up the fucking pieces. Glad there was a point to all of this.

&#x200B;

Oh, and my boyfriend told me he didn’t love me anymore last week. By text. While I was working.

&#x200B;

I seriously have never felt more worthless in my life. I feel like an absolutely waste of space. I’m obviously “too much” for people that they want to get away from me.

&#x200B;

It’s been a hell of a week and my mental state is much worse than it was before Friday.

&#x200B;

Im struggling harder with food right now than I have in a long time. Between my boyfriend dumping me, my friends abandoning me because I won’t listen to their uninformed advice, and my job sucking, I’m not doing a very successful job at staying healthy.

&#x200B;

I WILL say that through this whole month, I haven’t caved and self harmed. It’s been almost 4 years since I last did it, and apparently men or shorty friends won’t bring me down that far!

&#x200B;

Anyway, this was a pointless post, and I’m sorry. But I figured you all might know how I’m feeling and may have some solid advice or words for me. Have any of you all been given an “intervention” before? How did you handle it?

&#x200B;

Thank you.

Nothing. At least in my program, which is a reputable school in the USA. We had a few scattered mentions of refeeding syndrome electrolyte imbalances and which medications can and can’t be used for people who struggle with bulimia. I kept track of every time the topic came up, and it was sparse.

4,Request: Advice for boyfriend of girl with anorexia," 

Hey people of reddit. I’m desperate for advice...

My girlfriend of a little under a year is going through a really tough time right now and I’m not sure what to do.

Her therapist, her doctor, and a few of her friends and family have all shown concern about her eating habits. We have all made attempts to talk to her about it but she shuts down and gets extremely defensive and denies the possibility of an eating disorder. For a while, I have just been by her side comforting her and being as supportive as humanly possible.

The past few weeks she’s gone to her therapist and come home extremely upset. I would ask her if it was something she wanted to talk about or something she just wanted to just be left alone. When she would talk to me about it, it was always because her therapist would begin asking her about her eating and talk to her about developing a good relationship with food, etc. she would always follow up with something along the lines of, “this is ridiculous! I don’t have an eating disorder! I can eat a lot of food when I want to! She just sounds exactly like my grandparents.”

She will eat one or maybe two “meals” a day. These meals are usually a cup of yogurt with granola or some rice with cheese, tomatoes, and black beans.... which is one of the best meals she eats. 

She is very skinny. Unhealthily skinny. She still has a rather regular mensural cycle which I see as a good sign, but recently her kidneys and digestive tract have been giving her trouble along with extreme fatigue and regular depression.

I have been standing by as the supportive boyfriend, but now she is threatening to stop seeing her therapist and psychiatrist because they are “trying to tell her she has something she doesn’t.” She’s underweight and still dropping weight. I really really want to know if there’s a good way to help her come around and open up to the possibility of her having an eating disorder so she can actually start getting better.

She has always been concerned about her weight and always talks about how she wants to gain weight because she knows she’s not healthy. She will do good for a few days, then go a few days eating one meal or not eating at all because she says she just forgot or it wasn’t convenient. She gets down on herself, then she won’t eat because she says she’s so down that she’s not hungry.

I’m just really worried and at my wits end. Any advice is welcome.

To be clear, I am very careful NEVER to tell her to eat, tell her she should eat, tell her she is too skinny, or anything of the sort. I am sure to always tell her she will get to where she wants to be, she can do it, tell her she’s doing great when she has good days and reassure her that she is strong enough to get through the bad days.

When I make food for myself, I always make enough for her and offer it to her in a non suggestive way and never get on her when she turns it down.

TL;DR

Girlfriends therapist, doctor, and some family/friends have all shown concern about her eating habits but she is in complete denial. She is now beginning to suffer extreme health consequences because of her eating habits and still won’t come around to the thought of an eating disorder. She eats  very little. She is underweight. Diagnosed depression/anxiety, ADHD. Is threatening to leave her therapist because she is showing concern for her eating.

5,"Request: want to be healthy, but I feel as though a darker part of my mind doesn’t care about being healthy"," 

Not going to lie — the past few months have been rough. Around 5-6ish months ago, I began to restrict my calories to a very small amount. I'm thin, but not technically underweight according to BMI. However, during that span of time I lost my period & underwent multiple other side effects.

This slowly morphed into a binge/restrict cycle, where I'd reduce my intake even more to try and recover from the binges I’d have throughout the week. This has been happening for a while now (about 3 months).

I’m sick and tired of it. I hate living my life like this. I avoid events with food as much as possible, and usually decline my friends’ offers to hang out because it’s my “starvation” day to make up for a binge.

I’m heavier than my lowest of few months ago, but still in the lower end of normal BMI . I feel disgusting, and I hate it, but I know I need to break out of this cycle.

Honestly, I struggle with how much I’m supposed to eat in a day. I generally believed that the low number of calories I ate was enough for me. I’m 15, 5’1, and am currently in track. I try those online “calorie calculators” but all of them give me vastly different amounts, all much higher than what I'm eating.

Not only this, but to anyone who’s been through something similar: how do you stay motivated? Is there any advice you can give me to help me power through this? I really, really want this to end. I want to have a normal relationship with food. I’m sick and tired of this.

I’m just so terrified of gaining weight. I used to be heavier … towards the upper end of the normal BMI range, and can’t imagine ever going back to that point. I want to be healthy, but I feel as though a darker part of my mind doesn’t care about being healthy and just wants to be thin.

I’ve never told anyone about this, and this seemed like a good place to let my heart out and open up. Thank you for taking the time to read this. :) I’m not sure if anyone would be interested or if it mattered at all, but I’m thinking about posting my progress here in order to hold myself accountable.

9,Request: Public Perception Of EDs And How It Hurts," 

Hello, I have struggled with both AN and BED. I currently am trying to overcome BED. It’s a daily struggle. Scratch that. A moment to moment struggle. Currently I’m on a streak of emotional eating every single day for the last while. It’s been rough.

And I know this is going to sound horrible but, compared to my days of AN, this is so so much worse. Now, I am slightly larger than a good weight for me.

I get dirty looks. I get double takes if I wear something that shows a bit of cellulite or exposes a tummy roll. I have resorted to covering up all the time. Today I wore a turtleneck. It was 76 degrees. I sweat through my shirt underneath.

When I had more controlling and restrictive behaviors, I would actually get compliments. It was awful and alienating to receive positive feedback considering the negativistic attitude I had about feeding myself. But, nonetheless, I was received in an approving, even at times, envied, way. How messed up is that?! One ED is shamed, the other glamorized! Both hurt. And I don’t mean to further the glamorization in this post. The grass is greener, huh. I just miss fitting into my clothes, feeling confident in my skin. When I go to shop now, I look at things and want to shop for the old me, it feels surreal.

More than anything, I want to have a healthy and uncomplicated relationship with food. I’ve been trying for a long time to achieve this. Therapy. Books. Food journals. Apps.

I just feel at the end of my rope and I just wanted a space to vent.

So looking on the bright side I was able to recognize where the behavior came from 100%: I’m in a new country and completely alone, really struggling after 3 months here of pure traveling. Furthermore, the purge wasn’t even really about the calories as much as it was about just wanting to not feel sick and get rid of all the junk sugar I had just put into my body. So, I feel like those are small victories. Very small and I still have a long way to go, but even two months ago I would have engaged in these unhealthy behaviors and not thought twice about it.

11,Request: Cooking helped me get better," 

Cooking for myself every  day has helped me recover from bulimia and I've been in remission for  several years now. When I cook for myself, I see exactly what I'm going  to eat and I become familiar with it. Bulimia is all about control and  I've found a nice, moderate approach to meeting my body's needs.  For instance, I try to eat lots of veggies. I take veggie snacks to  work, I get produce delivery, and I try a new veggie every week or so to  encourage diversity in my eating and cooking habits. I enjoy eating and  I take time making my food. Cooking is how I unwind from a hard job and  while it means standing for a little longer, it's totally worth it. My local grocery store has certain 50% off deals for produce they want  off the shelves and I use that to diversify my diet as well. I take  reusable shopping bags and I have some cheap reusable produce bags that I  bought online so I can get the fresh items. I've maintained food's specialness without hurting myself.

1,Request: My boss says she doesn’t eat and I’m struggling to not relapse," 

I’ve recovered physically  from anorexia, at least for the almost most part. I’m about 5 months  into a new job, and I have a great boss who is a few years older than  me, who rarely eats during the work day, 8am-6pm. We’re in an office of 4  people. She likes to say that everyone knows she doesn’t eat, whereas  I’ve been eating ok for a while now in recovery. 

I’m really struggling with my own body image, and constantly try and  compare my size with everyone I see daily, and I think she’s skinner  than me. I’m very competitive and she’s able to not eat and function  well, whereas when I didn’t eat I felt horrible and my hair was thinning  a lot.

How do I ignore her daily comments on not being hungry and her not  eating, since I know it’s triggering me? Is she ok and struggling like  me, or maybe she’s healthy and I’m imagining  it? I can’t say anything,  she’s my boss!

I’ve started restricting at lunch and not eating any snacks during  the day since I don’t want to be seen eating food. Even when I feel  nauseous and I end up drinking a lot of water to avoid eating. I’m  stressing over eating breakfast and dinner now too. I feel the need to  slim down just in case. I’m supposed to be skinner than everyone else  els in real life.

I’d really appreciate advice and tips, I’ve actually been enjoying  eating, lightly restricting though, but almost at my target weight so no  one knows by looking at me about my past struggles. It’ll be hard to  fully restrict again, but I’m trying so hard to convince myself that I  should and finalize that decision. I just get so much panic and guilt  when I eat and enjoy the food! Please.

2,"Request: Girlfriend's ED is getting bad, what do I do?"," 

Hello all, I need some help pretty badly.

Recently, my (22M) girlfriend (22F) has begun to sink back into an ED that she once overcame. Since recovery, she gained weight to a healthy level, but her dysmorphia came back as well. She refers to herself as fat, although she is so far from it. I try and tell her that she is beautiful, fit, etc. but nothing works anymore.

Also, she has taken to begging me to insult her so she feels driven to restrict. A usual evening activity has become her begging me to call her ugly/fat and getting angry and dismissive when I refuse. She accuses me of trying to sabotage her. I'm feeling very overwhelmed and depressed by all of this, and really need some help.

p.s. She has refused therapy and professional help, although she went through counseling in the past.",bbk4vv,58.0,1.0,14.0,2019-04-10 09:50:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/bbk4vv/request_girlfriends_ed_is_getting_bad_what_do_i_do/,0.0,0.0,,

4,Request: losing Weight Without Relapsing," 

Hi I'm sorry if my formatting is weird or I'm not doing this right. I haven't been using Reddit for very long. But I really wanted some advice.

I have struggled with binge eating and restricting since I was in highschool. And now I'm in college and morbidly obese by my BMI. I wanted to make a change so I've been trying to lose weight without relapsing. But it's so difficult. I've lost some weight through low carb and counting calories. But it's such a difficult line to walk.

I have to be strict about my calories but not too strict. I have to think about what I eat but not too much. I have to actually avoid situations where I know my trigger foods will be available.

Does anyone have advice on how to lose weight without reverting back to your eating disorder?",bejlee,51.0,1.0,21.0,2019-04-18 09:42:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/bejlee/request_losing_weight_without_relapsing/,0.0,0.0,,

6,Request: How to lose weight healthily after an ED,"I literally made an account so I could post on this subreddit so forgive me if I’m doing this wrong in any way.

I’ve suffered with anorexia since I was 14. (I’m 24). I’ve technically been in recovery for about 4ish years now but I still have a lot of disordered thinking. I’ve also gained a lot of weight within those years and I’ve become very slightly over the weight considered normal for my height. But at the same time I used to be such an active person (I was a dancer) so seeing myself like this without muscle and honestly bigger than I’ve ever been is really jarring and messing with my self image. 

I want to try and lose weight in a way that is actual healthy for someone like me and get me into a healthy and fit body. From all the research that I’ve done, it seems like it’s not really possible. I’m constantly being told to just love and accept my body for what it is.** But if it’s causing me constant suffering to the point of where I’m afraid I’ll relapse I feel like that’s not the best course of action. I always feel better when I feel I’m actually working towards a goal, but I have no idea how to do it in a way that won’t cause a relapse. I’m currently working with a nutritionist so that I can maybe increase my metabolism but it still seems like nothing is working and I’m at a loss

**Other issues I have with the “just accept your body for what it is” mentality is that none of my
clothes fit correctly or look right so I have no confidence about my appearance and I am much too broke to actually go buy new clothes (not to mention how triggering clothes shopping in general is). Also my career of choice sadly relies heavily on appearances and I fear I am actively losing opportunities because of how I look currently. It’s not something I am willing to give up.

Is there any hope for me? I have no idea what to do. I just want to be happy and healthy in my body.",bh2i7j,33.0,0.89,16.0,2019-04-25 01:02:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/bh2i7j/request_how_to_lose_weight_healthily_after_an_ed/,0.0,0.0,,

i know it sounds crazy, but, i sometimes miss my eating disorder. Its something thats almost always in the back of my head and i dont really know who i am without it.😕 
 On one hand it sucked but on the other hand it helped me cope with my emotions. It was my best friend, my security blanket and my form of feeling in control of my life. Sometimes when i feel depressed or lonely or really anxious i end up restricting or purging to take my mind off of the other stuff. It distracted me in a way.
 I just feel kind of lost rn and dont know what im doing with my life. Nothing really feels familiar to me except the ED. its almost sort of comforting in a weird way.

1,Request: Today I stop tracking my calories and macros,"I thought that tracking calories would maximize my fitness journey's results. Consequently, I have been doing it religiously and obsessively for the past 8 months non-stop.
Starting with dinner today (which is in about 30 mins from writing this), I'll stop logging calories, 
Why?
I really feel that
1/ given my somewhat OCD/perfectionist nature (I don't have OCD though, lol, just very mentally strict with some things ocassionally), I feel that this was slowly developing out of control, to the point where I am on the verge of (but haven't) developing an eating disorder. I have first-hand experience with friends/family with ED, and I know it destroys lives (beyond just its victim). I'm glad I haven't developed ED, am sympthetic to those who have, and refuse to ever develop it.
2/ I have wasted so much time and effort on it - inputting food to the gram, researching the cooking method before eating it, etc.
3/ I've sacrificed so many opportunities (to make and hang out) with friends and families
4/ missed out on so many good (but healthy) foods. I used to love cheese, but have had periods where I avoided them because of minimum/maximum calorie and macronutrient requirements
5/ It isn't even that accurate. Let's be honest: companies fail in their food labels, you probably don't know your exact TDEE (which is made more volatile due to varying daily activities), and you don't always measure stuff correctly anyways
6/ even if every measurement and bit of labelling were accurate, the actual calories published are just estimates, even for the most basic whole foods like rice or oil
7/ your body doesn't treat all macronutrients the same (beyond total energy balance, a calorie is not a calorie), and doesn't absorb 100% of the macros you eat anyways
8/ it's costly: I sometimes had to go buy stuff last minute because food I already had ready at home did not fit my macros
9/ just more mental freedom really
10/ hindering my gains at the gym: (not applicable to everyone): - for a very long time my obsession with certain caloric and macro intakes have slowed down my progress because I feared I might over/under eat
11/ Lost productivity - I spend my time thinking way too much about meal planning, when I could've gone out and make money, study harder, or just play some FIFA (soccer video game).
12/ Personally, I don't intend to compete in anything professionally (bodybuilding, professional sports, ...) that requires obsessive control of macro and caloric intake; I'm just someone who enjoys physical exercise, wants to get big and strong and fit
13/ I can still look and feel healthy, stay fit, and have decent physical performance when needed (e.g. if I have to help someone carry stuff), and good bloodwork without calorie and macro tracking
There are probably a couple more reasons, but I think 1/, 10/, and 11/ are the most important ones.",bmfhrr,83.0,0.97,5.0,2019-05-09 04:29:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/bmfhrr/request_today_i_stop_tracking_my_calories_and/,0.0,0.0,2018.0,5.0

It got so bad that i had to go to the hospital. 

After that I realized I needed to change. I tried to eat regularly. I went vegan to convince myself to eat.

7,Request: Should I be worried if my partner who was previously hospitalized for an eating disorder is throwing up occasionally," 

My partner was hospitalized for an eating disorder about five years ago during college. She has talked to me about it and says that she is in recovery and has it under control but still struggle sometimes. I also have my issues and remind her she is lovable and worthy even if she struggles or is imperfect.

I’ve noticed that when things are going well she still throws up a couple times a month. When things aren’t going well (stress in our relationship, stress at her job, stress with her family) she throws up multiple times a week or even every day. I don’t bring it up when I notice.

I have asked if there is anything I can do to be supportive and she says It’s not my responsibility and she has it under control, which I accept. I’ve encouraged her to see a therapist (she has expressed wanting to see one just for a normal life help). Is there more I should be doing?

9,Request: Does anyone else enjoy actually enjoy cooking?,"Request: Does anyone else actually enjoy cooking?

Hello. I have been struggling with anorexia and bulimia for seven years now, and I have found that one of the things that helps me abtain nutrition and sustenance is actually cooking for myself and family. Directly after treatment a couple years back I was onky encouraged to use things like cereals, bars, takeout, just things that were mostly prepared. Rarely was I ever making a meal from scratch. 
I actually really enjoy cooking and my family loves the food I eat. It is one of the only thing I can approach in a less disordered fashion (basically, I know that if I want my family to eat it, I have to make real food and not some weird ED concoction), so it encourages me to eat foods I'd normally be afraid of and taste things as I go. Eating out is still really tough atm. 

Do any of you guys like to cook? Do you eat with family/friends? What kinds of things do you find yourself preparing (if thats allowed to say)? I'm very curious if anyone else has the same interest because for me, cooking is one of the few things that doesn't produce extreme anxiety and I always feel proud when I've made something well. The fact that i enjoy cooking so much always surprises treatment providers, as they say that most prefer not to do so.

10,Request: How can I help my sister," 

I(22F) live in Japan with my family. My sister(19F) have ED and I need help to help her. I'm trying my best to read as much as possible about ED, but my own depression and anxiety don't let me think straight sometimes. I try to practice the ""I"" statement, but she does't like it when I say that I worry about her.

Sometimes I feel so useless that I just sit there by her side and cry... I can't deal with this anymore. I need a break, but I can't. My mom don't understand her ED and she just put this situation in my hands. My dad is an asshole, a few weeks ago, he came to our room and just yell at her things like: ""You're the one destroying this family"" , ""This is all fake"" and ""You are a dumbass, only stupid people does this to their parents"". This things are in her head now, she even said that that's true and that there's nothing I can say to change this in her mind.

My sister will start treatment for depression this Wednesday. I don't know how things will go. Hopefully she'll get proper help. I don't know.

I keep watching my sister to see if she needs to talk or go out. But I need help with what to say to her after she binges. Or for example when she gain weight (she was devastated this morning). I always fell like I need to do something or at least say something, but I can never find the right words.

I was going for a walk with my cousin (24 years old and female) whom I have always been very close with. She is also recovering from anorexia so we chat about it regularly. We were talking about it for a solid 2 hours, and towards the end, she gave me a piece of advice that I've thought about a lot since. She said that when she starts hearing the anorexia thoughts, one of her methods of dealing with them is to make them sound stupid. Like, I don't know, say they're serving cake at a party and you notice the eating disorder thoughts coming. If you take a step back and make them sound dumb, it really puts it into perspective. For instance, you could tell yourself (sarcastically, of course):

Okay, yeah. Let's have a freak out about this one piece of cake, I'm sure that will make for a good evening

I've done the whole thing, the therapy, the nutritionists, the hospitalizations, and I hate to admit it but this is the thing that I think of most in everyday life. It really has helped me.

3,Request: ward experiences,"Hi I'm (15F) and I was hospitalized earlier this year.
Personally I hated my experience and it didn't exactly motivate me to get better. I'm just really confused by everything.

I stayed at the hospital a bit and nothing noteworthy happened there, but soon I was moved to a psych ward. The place wasn't specifically for eating disorder patients, but there were a couple others. First evening I struggled to eat, and the guy watching my meal just basically started yelling at me. 

Next odd thing to me was the constant surveillance which yea I get the point, but it was uncomfortable, like wherever we went there was a nurse listening and it was so awkward I guess.

I hated the ward so much, it felt like punishment more then anything. We would literally get told that ""This isn't a place to be happy, focus on your treatment"" if we were having ""too much"" fun (I mean like just laughing loudly and cracking jokes and chilling with each other)
Another specific instance was when I was having trouble eating at all and I had been refusing to drink the meal replacement thingy. A guy just starting on his shift comes in takes the drink pours it in the sink and says that I'm just wasting everyone's time.

The last thing is that no one has ever mentioned putting me in theraphy. Not even in the checkups. I mean they just make me go to some family sessions, but nothing individually for me.


I mean I don't know, maybe that all is standard, but I hated it and it didn't help me one bit. It just made me suicidal if I'm being honest.

4,Request: How should I talk about my child's mom's eating disorder to him?," 

To give some background, I am a single dad and am no longer with my son's mom. We were in a relationship for roughly 5 years. We had a child at the end of our relationship and are working to co-parent our child. She has recieved therapy, both inpatient and outpatient, for roughly 20 years including several dozen times of inpatient and basically constant outpatient over the years.

I understand a lot about how to support recovery myself as I've gone through years of support groups, therapy sessions with her and on my own, yet I know that there is always more to learn.

My child's mom is currently in inpatient. It's not the first time since our child has been born. But our child is getting older and has some more questions (and fears) about it. The little one is roughly about school age.

How should I explain this to them? What should I tell them? How specific should I be? What should I avoid?

Our child absolutely loves mom and rightfully is concerned about her. There are questions about what this place is that she is at and whether she is sick or is going to get better.

I don't want to lie. I want to tell the truth in a way that is able to be understood. And I definitely don't want to scare.

But the truth is that this is going to be something that is lifelong. There will likely be inpatient treatment at least once a year. There will be mental health and emotional issues that will come up with her. And we will all have to deal with that together.

6,"Request: Post Request: Are other people's perception of ""healthy"" distorted?","Hey. So I've struggled with Anorexia Nervosa B/P Subtype for many years. I'm 20 years old and had hit my lowest weight this year. I have recently gained a small amount of weight, like single digits.

7,Request: Mother buys my trigger foods. Is it OK if I throw them out?," 

So let me give a short background. I've struggled with an ED since I was about 13, so a decade now. My psychiatrist has categorized it as EDNOS, because I have episodes of anorexic like behaviors and then bulimic like behaviors.

I've lived with my parents throughout this. They don't know all the nitty gritty details. They know I've been properly diagnosed. They'll notice when I lose a lot of weight. My mom will sometimes comment on it. My dad never does. If they don't see me eat for a long time, they'll ask about when the last time I ate was. Overall, they don't really stick their noses too much into it. Probably because (due to my Hoshimoto's disorder and low thyroid), no matter how much i restrict and over exercise, I never lose enough weight to look dangerously emaciated, and my BMI tends to stay towards the low end of normal. So obviously it's not as serious, right? -.-

Anyways, I have trigger foods, of course. There are specific foods that I ask my mom not to have in the house. It's not a long list. It really only consists of a few things, sweets like: pecan rolls, a couple specific kinds of cereals, a couple specific kinds of donuts, a couple specific kinds of candy, and one type of cookie. White chocolate macadamia nut. When I say a couple specific, I do really mean like 2 or 3 kinds. That leaves at least a dozen other options in each category. In total, the list is probably less than 10 things.

Now she knows the reason. It's not like I asked and said ""just because."" I SPECIFICALLY told her, I don't want them around me, because if I have one, I will binge and then purge. If I'm already in a binge/purge episode, it's almost guaranteed. If I'm not, it can lead to a binge, and start me into one of those episodes.

She KNOWS. that I have a VERY legitimate reason to be afraid of having them in the house.

She does ok with not buying candy or donuts very often. She still buys all the other foods on my short list, though. I do my best and can usually keep myself away from them. Though that usually leads to me restricting even more, so I can feel like I have more control to keep myself from eating them.

Now, the white chocolate macadamia nut cookies. I dont know why, but they are the bane of my existence. Those are the problem.

My dad likes having cookies around for a before bed treat. He's not picky. He likes all cookies. I've asked him, in front of my mom, if he cares if she does not bring those ones home. He said no, they're not even his favorite, so he does not care.

My mom brings them home at least every other week. And at this point, it makes me SO. MAD. She's not even TRYING to take into consideration the ONE thing I've asked her to help me with. Why????? So when she brings them home, I throw them out. I'm fucking sick of it. It makes me mad. I know im wasting food and I feel bad wasting money. BUT IF SHE DOESNT WANT ME TO THROW THEM OUT, ALL SHE HAS TO DO IS PICK ONE OF THE OTHER 10 KINDS OF COOKIES. And she won't. So is it wrong of me to do that?

TL;DR I ask my mom not to bring home a certain trigger food for my eating disorder. She doesn't care, so I throw them out whenever she buys them.

0,Request: “i wish i had your eating disorder”,"this is something that a couple of my friends have said to me. and it pisses me off to no end. 

ive dealt with almost every eating disorder since i was a pre-teen. it all began with me binge eating, which led to me gaining my weight and getting an extreme amount of self hatred and body dysmorphia. then that turned into bulimia. ive gone through phases of obsessively counting calories, purposely starving myself, and just generally having an awful relationship with food. ive gained and lost weight countless times, many times in a short period of time. and right now i guess i would be considered anorexic. so ive kind of been through it all. 

two of my friends are self diagnosed binge eaters. one of them i completely believe, she goes to therapy (pretty sure she’s diagnosed) and we’ve talked about our relationship with food before. the other one however seems to just generally eat too much because she likes food and occasionally uses the label. im not trying to say she doesn’t have any issues with food, it just seems like she throws around the label of an eating disorder very loosely. 

anyways, both of these friends have made comments before about “i wish i had that eating disorder” and “haha i got the wrong eating disorder” and especially “we get it. youre skinny”. and it really fucking sucks. like ive had years of obsessing over every bite of food that goes into my body. most of the time i cant even enjoy food. and they act like they’re jealous of it. 

this is mostly just kind of a rant because its on my mind. its not something either of them say often, and they aren’t purposely trying to hurt me. i was mostly just curious if anyone else has dealt with something like this, or if you have any advice on how to handle it",d90x1s,109.0,1.0,6.0,2019-09-25 09:36:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/d90x1s/request_i_wish_i_had_your_eating_disorder/,0.0,0.0,2019.0,9.0
1,Request: Responding to the question “Do you think I’m fat?”,"Some background info: My girlfriend and I have been together for just over 3 years. In all the time I’ve known her she’s been underweight, and she recently confided in me that she has had a difficult relationship with food for a long time. She was diagnosed with an eating disorder just under a year ago and around then she lost a significant amount of weight in a short period of time.

Since then she has made some amazing steps and has put some weight back on (although she is still a ways away from her weight when we first met, and by extension what her doctor would classify as healthy) as well as tackling the psychological aspect of recovery head on.

I’m extremely proud of her and trying to be as supportive as possible and this sub has been incredibly helpful for advice, but one thing I’m still struggling with is the question she sometimes asks: “Do you think I’m fat/gross/heavy?” I’m struggling with how to answer this in the best way and I hoped I could get some advice from you all. 

So far, I have responded with a “No.” followed by changing the subject slightly by telling her how proud I am of the progress she’s made in such a short space of time, trying to draw attention to the positives of her recovery so far without focussing on the weight.

One thing I’ve been actively trying to avoid saying is something like “No, you look healthy” or “No you look fine”. Some other threads I have read on this sub suggested that telling someone they look “healthy” can also be demoralising, and I feel to say “fine” would be to downplay the progress she has made. 

In addition to this I’m also trying to avoid this language so as not to normalise the weight she is currently at, although I am wondering if this is a valid concern?

This is all very new to me and though I’m trying the best I can any advice on this subject would be extremely helpful, thank you.",cz47l6,69.0,0.98,21.0,2019-09-03 12:28:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/cz47l6/request_responding_to_the_question_do_you_think/,0.0,0.0,2019.0,9.0
2,Informational Post: Have you heard of a disorder called ARFID?," 

A lot of people saw a BBC article about a boy recently who went blind because of malnutrition caused by his own poor diet. While the BBC briefly mentioned ARFID in their article, their title heavily capitalized on the stigma around picky eating, and other articles even went as far as to blame the victim, calling him fussy, or to blame his family.

[https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/a-british-teenager-is-blind-but-not-because-of-junk-food-or-fussy-eating/](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/a-british-teenager-is-blind-but-not-because-of-junk-food-or-fussy-eating/)

That boy suffered from ARFID, Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder. ARFID is a more recent discovery among food disorders, being only a few years old, making it a recent addition to the DSM5.

ARFID is characterized by an unwillingness to eat anything except for certain ""safe foods."" People with ARFID come in all shapes and sizes and vary in what their safe foods are and how many they have. For some, ARFID seems to stem from childhood experiences with food, but that doesn't hold true for all. They often blame texture for why they don't like new foods. For someone with ARFID, trying new foods causes great anxiety or even panic attacks. Trying something new comes with the fear of throwing up. It doesn't matter how hungry you are, with ARFID, one will gladly starve instead of eating a non safe food.

With the stigma around picky eating, it's often difficult for someone with ARFID to eat out at restaurants or at friends' houses. People try to push eating new things without understanding how difficult ARFID makes it, and if you turn down any offers of food, people become worried or judgemental. People wonder how you can say you don't like a food you've never tried. Sometimes parents who's children have ARFID will force them to try new things or try to wean them off safe foods, but this tends to do more harm than good. More info here: [https://notapaperjournal.wordpress.com/2019/09/06/arfid-awareness-101/](https://notapaperjournal.wordpress.com/2019/09/06/arfid-awareness-101/)

There's very little awareness about ARFID compared to other eating disorders, and it can be hard to find information about it. Right now, our subreddit is having a mass growth because of the BBC article. Many of us have suffered ARFID all our lives thinking that we were alone, suffering some strange, nameless thing that nobody else has. If you think you or someone you know may be suffering from ARFID, you are not alone.

We may not have a national ARFID day, but we have a support subreddit over at [/r/ARFID](https://www.reddit.com/r/ARFID) . We also have a discord server you can join from there. Our subreddit has a WIP food encyclopedia pinned, which may help ARFID sufferers find foods that are very similar to their safe foods to try.

4,Request: student seeking participant for questionnaire on eating disorders," 

Hello there! My cohorts and I have created a questionnaire for families affected by eating disorders in order to further understand their needs for learning more about EDs and how to further support their loved one. This questionnaire also applies to people who have or had experienced EDs as well. If you know someone (can be family or friend) who had or has an ED (diagnosed, undiagnosed, or suspected) please take the questionnaire. I really appreciate your time! Thank you so much. The following is the link to the questionnaire:

Tonight I felt very sad and alone after I got some upsetting news. I binged for comfort
 and it made me feel better in the moment, but now I just feel disgusting, awful, sick, and like a failure. I purged to ""compensate"" but obviously that made me feel worse. 

I feel like I'm just going to balloon up and gain a bunch of weight from this. Which really scares me. I don't know how to recover. What makes you feel better after a binge?

7,Request: worried about friend," 

Hey guys, my friend (16F) has been acting really strange lately and I didn’t know what else to do, so I thought posting here might be a good option. She has never had a huge stomach, but lately she’s been eating like only a granola bar at lunch. She claims that she eats a big dinner but I’m pretty sure she’s telling her parents she’s not hungry and eats at school. She also calls herself fat all of the time and talks about wanting to lose weight (she’s definitely not fat, she’s quite on the skinny side). She also says that she drinks a full bottle of water before she eats so that she’s “more full.” Lastly, she said she wants to join my schools swim team just because swimming burns a lot of calories.

These seem like pretty scary and abnormal things (I haven’t mentioned a few others as well) and I was wondering what I should do to help her out, without losing our trust and friendship.

10,Request: ED recovered with ED best friend,"28f. I recovered over the last 4 years. I had a secret ED from 11-24, and I eat mindfully but not restrictively and I'm very healthy now. My best friend has finally accepted that she has one. For the last 3 years, it's gotten bad. She's a binger, but often tries to purge/abstain with little success (not that it makes a difference. Urges still there, still dangerous no matter what)

For the last 2 years, I've tried to tell her that her negative talk about herself affects me. I've tried to set boundaries many times but she always ends up going back to her old way of talking around me. It even bleeds into her social media. It's almost daily that she brings up her weight and how massive and disgusting she is (her words)

But I think she's beautiful. I tell her so.

She weighs the same as me with the same body type and measurements almost exactly. This hurts me both for her and me.

I don't know what to do anymore. I absolutely do not want to cut my best friend of 12 years out of my life, but it's so hard for me to talk to her. It's LITERALLY every day, sometimes more than a few times. It coaxes my bad thoughts right back up. What can I do that I haven't already? I really don't want to be harsh to her.

2,Request: Mom doesn't acknowledge my recovery efforts and enables my ED.,"Request: Mom doesn't acknowledge my recovery efforts and enables my ED. 

Hello, I hope this is allowed here. I am currently (20F) and have struggled with an ED since I was 13. I was initially diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa Restrictive Subtype but last year began abusing laxatives and diuretics so I am diagnosed as 'Purging Subtype.' I went through a six month period of severe B/P behaviors while at my lowest weight ever. Basically, I would fast all week, than plan a massive binge, than make myself purge all night. And repeated every. single. week. I was so miserable and so food obsessed. I would cook ridiculous meals like a buffet and eat until I would nearly vomit, I was torturing myself. In July, I began making some recovery efforts. Returned to my therapist, had to get stomach surgery from the damage my purging had done, and began attempting to eat more regularly. First just a solid, non restricted meal once a day, than twice, and now three times per day. My mother has been incredibly triggering and grows more angry with me at any efforts I take to further my independence. My grades and gpa have greatly improved, and as a foodie at heart, i am not only able to cook meals but portion them and eat. I have become much better at not asking for reassurance and instead assuring myself that i need to eat. My parents work a lot so I log my food via photography which i send to my best friend or therapist for support, and i even make efforts to bring snacks such as some muffins i bake, or a smoothie to school. I have deleted my calorie counters but i am not really able to eat at restaurants yet, as i dont feel mentally ready. 

My mother seems to miss my former B/P behaviors. I went through a really intense period of binging 10000+ cals per day, to the point where in july i needed hospitalization and as i mentioned earlier, a surgery due to severe bowel impaction. Sometimes, she implies that she misses these behaviors. I used to compare what I ate to her and refused to eat alone or while she worked, meaning i would wait to have dinner with her at 9 pm, usually fainting in the process or having a B/P session. She often puts down what I eat, as her and I have different likes/dislikes. I need wheat bread for my GI issues, and i tend to eat a lot of dark meat chicken which she claims is ""fattening"" which is just so triggering. I am usually hungry at much different times of day than her, like she wont eat til 1 pm where as I make breakfast at 8 am as i feel i really need a schedule. This evening for dinner we were ready to sit and eat and she said she was also going to have a bit of smoked salmon with her meal (we made lasagna). I told her i wasn't really in the mood for that and id pass. she said i NEEDED to have some. I said, ""i dont want any though. i dont make you eat foods you dont want to eat."" for example, she eats fish for dinner a few nights a week which im allergic to. i eat oats with peanut butter all the time which shes allergic to. she then told me she misses the old days when id make elaborate platters and host big dinners with the neighbors. i said ""those were binging and purging sessions. id wake up at 4 am, go for a run, than center my entire day around binging and purging. it was so painful. i dont miss any of that. i was going through a lot of pain."" apparently she sees those meals as lovely family time even though she saw how bad itd get. id throw up at the table. i was feeling tortured in my own mind. she also makes fun of my body. i wore a sports bra today and she said i looked disgusting and skeletal. i said ""im practicing body confidence. it was really hard to put this on. i was trying to feel more confident in myself instead of covering my body since its changed."" im not at my lowest weight anymore and trying to accept change. i really dont know what to do. i have mt friends and therapist in my corner encouraging me, but she is so toxic to my recovery. can anyone give me some advice?",dmva69,65.0,0.99,11.0,2019-10-25 10:05:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dmva69/request_mom_doesnt_acknowledge_my_recovery/,0.0,0.0,,

I’m scared of having someone analyze my eating habits, and monitoring me in general. He made me promise to tell him when I have these thoughts of purging/ restriction and he’ll be checking on me to make sure I’ve eaten. Basically he’s gonna be the food police. 

I’m also scared I don’t look sick enough. I’ve always been relatively thin but I’m not underweight. Teetering on the edge of it but not quite there. I almost feel like I need to prove my disorder to him. 

This is all new to me. Basically nobody has ever known about my eating disorder in the 5 years it’s been going on, and when my parents found out when I lived at home nothing happened. Being thin is the ultimate goal for a woman’s appearance in my family.

9,Request: just want to thank the community and introduce myself,"Iv been lurking between a few of these reddit forums for eating disorders lately.

I was going to post anonymously because I didnt particularly want to be tied to this, but I'm trying to get to a point where own what's going in with myself.

It wasnt until recently that I admitted to myself that I had a problem.  One that's been with me for years.  For the longest time I blamed being sick or that I was reacting to food badly but I got to the point where I was sick of making excuses.

After losing a lot of weight I became obsessed with that one or two extra pounds and for years went through purging forcefully to the point where I'd eat anything unhealthy and my body would react.

I didn't want to accept that I had a problem, because how could a big dude have an eating disorder?  But I came to find out through and other forums that others had the same issue and it really helped me take a first step in admitting I have a problem.  

It got so bad that I started to gain weight because it destroyed my metabolism. So much that I stopped eating for extended periods of time, made it worse, and the cycle just perpetuated itself.  I would literally have a bowl of cereal and go running until my body couldnt move for the sake of justifying food, and then still end throwing up because I hated how I felt and looked.

Everything just kept mounting up, up until I stopped doing costumes entirely because I couldnt look at myself in photos.  My depression and unhealthy relationship from food got worse and worse.  

So here i am, taking the first step and admitting out loud that i have an issue, and thanking all those.who have posted with similar issues in helping me move forward from here.

4,Request: I binge or I don’t eat at all. Why can’t I find a balance?,"I’ve struggled with my weight and body image my whole life. I probably have body dysmorphic disorder, but I am for sure overweight by BMI standards.

I’ve been overweight most of my life due to uncontrollable binge eating, but I have also gone through several periods of anorexia over the years. During these recurring ED shifts, my weight has fluctuated several times drastically in both directions. 

When I get into my binge mode it’s like I’m literally insatiable. It’s never enough food, no matter how much I eat.

When I’m in my anorexic mode, it’s like food isn’t even edible. My favorite foods don’t look good anymore and I can barely make myself chew and swallow even the most basic, plain, bland foods. 

Needless to say, I like anorexic me better (as far as looks are concerned) but I don’t *like* that I like anorexic me. My weight seems healthier on paper but I know I’m not actually healthy based on my lack of nutrition. 

I’ve never met anyone else who struggles in quite the same way with this issue, and I could use some guidance to break this cycle I’m caught in.",dtdus2,73.0,1.0,6.0,2019-11-08 11:00:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/dtdus2/request_i_binge_or_i_dont_eat_at_all_why_cant_i/,0.0,0.0,,

I'm worried about my daughter though. My wife gets to me pretty often and hurts me emotionally and I'm a grown man - I can only imagine the affect it has on our daughter. She's only 4. 

Recently our daughter is refusing to eat lunch at daycare. She eats decently at home, albeit slowly. I'm worried the eating disorder is starting to affect her. I've heard it can affect even kindergarten aged children.

6,Request: What is normal eating supposed to be like?,"I’m recovering from eating issues (at first it was anorexia and then weird diet restrictions, wayyy over exercising for years, and the past few it’s been purging but no binging and I stopped working out a lot in June) and I literally don’t know what normal eating is supposed to be like.

I have an appointment with a dietitian in a few weeks and in a couple months I’m going to do outpatient treatment so I will get guidance soon but until then I don’t know what I should be shooting for.

Googling what to eat recovery is confusing. 3 meals a day? AND snacks? Snacks plural? I’m used to making myself wait until dinner time to eat and then purging half of it. Maybe a light lunch occasionally. I’m trying to eat 3 meals and it is really hard. I don’t feel hungry yet for breakfast or lunch, and then I feel so much guilt for eating those meals when I don’t feel hungry yet. I start feeling really hungry around 2:30pm and my stomach goes nuts all growly and hungry and then if I wait an hour I don’t feel hungry anymore. 

What is normal eating supposed to look like? I feel like it should be something like “eat when you’re hungry” whenever that is, but my hunger cues are all out of wack. 

So should it be structured? Based on specific times of day? Because if that’s the case, it’s one more thing for me to over obsess on and I fall in the negative panic attack depression cycle for being off the schedule. 

And how do I know how much to eat? Is my metabolism a great deal slower from damage? Or just a little bit?

If anybody wants to weigh in on advice, explanations, tips, random facts, personal opinions, conspiracy theories, recipes, macro guides, or knock knock jokes, please feel free. I’d really appreciate it.

The date otherwise went (I felt) extremely well, and it sounds like we are both interested in meeting up again soon, but I'm wondering if it's healthy for her to pursue anything right now?

- Do the facilitators of her treatment program recommend dating while she's going through the program?
- How can I (otherwise) support her while she's going through the program?

But also, I'm concerned about how her relationship with me could affect her recovery. Like, if we date for 8 weeks and it doesn't work out, could it exacerbate potential body dysmorphia issues (if her disorder is one which stems from those)?

8,Request: Anybody else experienced PTSD caused BY an eating disorder?," 

This weekend marked 1 year into anorexia recovery for me.

About 5 or 6 months into my recovery I started experiencing PTSD symptoms, which I am now treating the ptsd with exposure therapy and emdr.

I feel traumatised by my time with anorexia, it includes flashbacks and body memories of the scariest times during restriction during my recovery and I was scared for a while that even though I physically recovered I'd be reliving the experience forever and ever.

So I wondered, has anyone else experienced anything similar? Is it normal for an ED to trigger ptsd in someone? I really thought that i would just have to heal from the ED itself.

Whenever I Google stuff I can only find things about how PTSD causes ED and not the other way round so I'd love some insight, and if anyone can relate

9,Request: Personal: unable to feel full,"Hi everyone,

New here, but I’m currently 21 and I was previously suffering from eating disorder(s) (won’t dive into it extremely). From 14-16 was the worst of my issues, then I seemed to recover, and had a few slip ups in between. 

However, last year I got very heavily into exercising and dieting. I started to track my macros and that kinda sparked bad habits again. I got too obsessive and eventually broke down because it was wearing me thin. I was always hungry, tired, and drained, so I stopped counting and went back to eating intuitively. I also drastically increased my calories. 

Although I am eating more and I’m no longer counting what I eat, I am still literally so hungry that it is insatiable. I am 5’3, small frame, I should not require half as much food as I eat but I literally can eat PLATES upon PLATES of food in one sitting, and then 45 minutes later be hungry again. It is LITERALLY like my stomach has no end, like I don’t know what full is anymore. I tried to eat until I was full once recently, and it literally involved shoving my face with food.

I haven’t known what full feels like in so long it’s ridiculous. I didn’t have this problem previously, and it’s getting annoying, because I’ll go out to eat and then have to eat again 45 minutes later. And I’m not eating extremely small portions anymore - I’m eating normal sized portions. Any advice? How do I make this go away?

11,Request: I Think About Food Constantly,"Hi. So this is my (20F) first post to this thread so sorry if I’m doing any of this wrong. 

But I’ve had a really bad relationship with food for a long time, and I’ll try and keep this short- the thing is my dad used to really meanly comment on my eating habits my whole life. Always telling me I was eating too much (I was a chubby kid, but active) and I needed to diet or I was going to end up like my obese aunt. So by the time I’d gotten to high school I’d developed pretty severe depression (more to it than just this but that’s another story) and started restricting myself from eating, exercising on the treadmill instead of going to the cafeteria for lunch, skipping meals with friends, and constantly keeping my daily calorie count below a certain number. I’ve never seen a therapist or ever really talked to anyone about it, but after graduating I’d been eating more (no more calorie counting, but I’m still very aware of how much calories I’m consuming) and in the past two and a half years I’ve put on more weight and I’ve been obsessed with how I look. And the days when the depression is at its worst are the days I don’t eat, but all I do is think about food.

If I’m not eating, I’m thinking about eating or making food, all I want to do is eat. But I hate myself for eating, I feel guilty, like I’m betraying myself, like I’m doing something wrong. I’m unhappy but I just don’t know what to do about it, I’m in an unbearable cycle. And it definitely doesn’t help that I work in a restaurant full time and I’m surrounded by food constantly. I just look down and want to eat anything I see, food is always on my mind and I just want to not think about it anymore.

I don’t know if this actually fits into the classification of eating disorder or not but I’m just really not sure what else it could be... am I just crazy? Is this normal?

14,Request: Doctors won’t give my bulimic little sister the help she needs because she is not ‘under weight’,"Hi all,

My little sister is 15 and she’s a healthy weight,
she isn’t big at all but she is just a normal weight in the eyes of professionals. She lost a massive amount of weight over the past 5 months, I’m not sure how much exactly but the doctors didn’t see that so they have decided to not take much notice in it.

She has admitted to me she is bulimic, after noticing little things like her sipping water constantly between meals, going to the bathroom after every meal, running taps whenever she went to the ‘toilet’. Eventually I went to speak to her and she broke down and had to open up to me.
After a while she finally agreed to get help, so we went to the gp who’s first comment was “well you’re obviously not underweight” ??? Who says that to a young girl who is there for that exact reason? Anyway, she just told us to watch her eating and told her to eat 3 meals a day and to return if we saw any drastic weight loss.

Obviously this only made things worse and she saw no point in getting help, she felt worse than before because even the doctor had pointed out her weight. 
After a few weeks of research we got a referral to speak to somebody at CAHMS (child and adolescent mental health services). The initial appointment went well and she scheduled her an appointment with an ED specialist to weigh her and talk through her eating habits etc... 
AND AGAIN, before he weighed her, before he even spoke to her his initial comment was “you’re noticeably not underweight”.

WHY? Is this a normal thing? I don’t understand how health professionals, even those who specialise in the illness can be so insensitive.

Does anybody have any suggestions on where we can actually get help and not accentuate the problem? Worried as although she is not yet an unhealthy weight, the affects bulimia has on your body aside from the weight loss are extremely serious. She has complained of cramps in her chest a few times over the past month and I’m worried it’s going to turn into something worse than it already is.

It’s not often somebody actually builds courage to ask for help and they just aren’t taking it seriously.

i’m a 21 y/o girl and i’m very reluctantly weight restored after struggling with anorexia for around 8 years. 
as with most people with EDs, the christmas period is my idea of a living hell. this has been my first christmas in a number of years where i’ve regained somewhat “normal” eating habits so i’ve tried to let myself eat what i want.. and the guilt has been almost unbearable. i’m pretty newly weight restored (since around septemberish) but i’m still struggling to overcome an exercise addiction - however i’m in my final year of university and the past few weeks i’ve been too busy to find time to go to the gym, and that was really my only coping mechanism. the past couple of weeks have been scrutinising in terms of body image because of the indulgent food and lack of exercise, to the point i don’t even want to take a shower because my body dysmorphia is so bad. i’ve been avoiding going outside because i don’t want anybody to see me, and baggy clothes haven’t been helping because i still feel like i look big. I can’t help but feel like my whole body is crawling because of how bad i feel that it looks.

11,"Request: Request to post a question, “Eating disorder or a diet?”","Eating disorders and diets.What are the key differences between the two? I’m talking about if for example, you were looking at two people with similar weights and you had to figure out which one had an eating disorder and which one was just on a diet. What would you? Which would be the key factors that would help you figure out which person has which?

I personally struggle with not feeling sick enough to ask for help, I invalidate myself and am in fear of people doing the same to me.",e9md5o,37.0,0.97,17.0,2019-12-12 11:24:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/e9md5o/request_request_to_post_a_question_eating/,0.0,0.0,,
12,Request: Believe my sister has bulimia but don’t know how to approach her about it.,"I’m currently a university student and so spend most my time living away from home. With it now being Christmas I am back home for a month with my family. My sister is 16 and a few months back was making herself sick after almost every meal, she doesn’t eat much anyway. However things seemed to improve for the last few months before I moved away, but since coming back it’s obvious she’s restricting her food again as well as making herself sick. She’s a ballet dancer and so has always been in good shape. I wouldn’t categorise her as looking overly underweight, she just has a slim frame. I’m worried that if she continues she will end up falling to an unhealthy weight and potentially becoming seriously ill. My mum is aware of what’s going on but she isn’t a confrontational person and so tries to avoid conflict around the subject, meaning she rarely brings it up to her. I am yet to say anything as I don’t know the correct way to approach it. The last thing I want is for her to just totally shut me out because she thinks I’m forcing her to do something she doesn’t want. Any advice on how to approach this?",een7jr,40.0,1.0,11.0,2019-12-23 17:01:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/een7jr/request_believe_my_sister_has_bulimia_but_dont/,0.0,0.0,,
13,Request: How do I help my friend who has an eating disorder?,"My best friend told me a couple months ago that she had been going days without eating for a good while. I’m the only one she’s told. After she told me I asked if she still doesn’t eat much and she completely avoided the question, so I’ve kept a close eye on her to see if I notice any signs. 

I’ve noticed a bit of a change in her body. When we go out as a group to eat she always says she’ll eat when she gets home, but when she first told me about her eating disorder she said she tells us she eats at home and tells her parents she ate with us when she gets home. 

I’ve talked to her about it and told her that I know it hasn’t stopped but she keeps denying it. I don’t know what to do and I feel so bad for just sitting around and not doing anyone. What should I do?",e9ywdi,35.0,0.98,7.0,2019-12-13 04:10:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/e9ywdi/request_how_do_i_help_my_friend_who_has_an_eating/,0.0,0.0,,
14,Request: Admitting I have an ED?,"So i’m on a sports team in school, and every new season they require you to get a physical and fill out an athletic packet. There’s a page where they ask you a bunch of questions regarding illnesses, family background etc., and there’s a section that asks if you have an ed, as well as some other questions in that area. Id like to check off yes, but i’m sacred that im making things into a bigger deal that they are. i am underweight, and i do engage in tons of ed behavior (i’m actively trying to get better though), but i’ve never been formerly diagnosed. even though nobody but the athletic director of the school is going to read it, i feel like if i admitted to having these problems it would be like i’m looking for attention. i feel like the best solution would just be to mark “no”. thoughts?",e5fidv,34.0,0.97,8.0,2019-12-03 10:56:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/e5fidv/request_admitting_i_have_an_ed/,0.0,0.0,,
