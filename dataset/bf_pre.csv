0,A Story of Hope (How My Brain Fog Cleared),"After 2.5 years of horrible brain fog and dizziness, I finally feel better.  I am not a frequent visitor of this subreddit, however it was information I found here that helped me find a solution so now I am giving back.  Let's start out with my symptoms:

Since mid-2015 I've suffered from chronic ""brain fog,"" which I use as a blanket phrase that covers a range of odd symptoms that seemingly came out of nowhere.  I would usually feel ""spaced out,"" disconnected, confused, slow and fatigued.  Like I wasn't present, almost like life was a dream.  This caused irritability and anxiety at times.  There seemed to be some kind of obstruction, like cotton, in the forward part of my head above and behind my eyes.  I couldn't think clearly, concentrate or form sentences when this feeling would come.  I tried to isolate triggers, from diet to environmental, but it seemed fairly random apart from stress contributing to it.  Since I was living in Taiwan at the time, I assumed it was related to pollution or some other environmental factor.  Some days I'd have no symptoms at all, and others it would come and go randomly throughout the day.  When I did feel the brain fog, I would also feel other weird symptoms like dizziness, off balance, shaky and sometimes I would experience buzzing sensations in my hands and feet.  I visited several doctors, had blood work run up, had vitamin drip IVs, and even an X-ray on my neck which did show some inflammation.  After two years of making little-to-no progress, I ended up moving back to the United States with my wife to see if that would resolve the issue.  While there was slight improvement, it didn't go away completely.  After being home for a couple months, I got very discouraged as the brain fog was starting to affect my work.  

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago.  I tried thinking back to when this all started in mid-2015.  Could I trace these weird symptoms back to anything in particular?  It was at that moment I realized I'd had a strange injury one night while sleeping in a bed that wasn't mine (I was staying at my in-laws).  I had woken up that morning with a shooting pain in my spine, right between my shoulder blades, that extended up into my neck.  For several days I couldn't move my head at all from side to side without intense pain.  I chalked it up to a bad pillow and went to see a Chinese Doctor, who did something like a chiropractic adjustment.  When he cracked my neck, much of the immobility and pain I'd been experiencing cleared right away.  I moved on and didn't think much else of it.  

So a few weeks ago I did a few searches on Reddit and found other folks mentioning chiropractic adjustments had helped their brain fog.  I called up a chiropractor friend of mine and he volunteered to give me a couple adjustments.  When I visited him, he said I was very stiff and could see the remnants of the injury from two years earlier.  My posture was also bad from years of hunching over on the computer.  He did a couple adjustments on me and sent me on my way.  

Within 48 hours, 80% of my brain fog symptoms disappeared.  I experienced a mental clarity like I hadn't felt in a long time.  Within a week, 90% of symptoms had cleared.  I just went for my second adjustment yesterday and feel like I'm back to my normal self for the first time in years.  I am pretty astounded what a difference it made in such a short time.  I also feel more mobility in my neck and less tightness in my shoulders.  I am deeply thankful.  

I know everyone is different and ""brain fog"" can be related to many different issues and health conditions.  I am not suggesting a one-size-fits-all approach here.  But for those of you who perhaps share a similar story, maybe chiropractic work will help you.

0,Welcome to r/brainfog!,"Welcome to the official brain fog subreddit! Brain fog is the feeling that your brain is not working correctly or at full speed, almost like it’s in a cloud.

0,Let's kill this BrainFog [Part 1],"**Intro**

I've suffered from Brain fog since 2010-2011. So, 7-8 years. I'm getting a restart on life and this is the one problem holding me back now. It's time to change that!

&#x200B;

I'm posting here to document the journey in resolving this. The posts to come will attempt to be as rigorous and detailed as possible so that it may help others help themselves, and help others identify issues I can't see myself. A lot of the posts here seem to celebrate the conquering of ""brain fog"" with simple tricks, like elimination of coffee or a single trip to the chiropractor. I'd love my solution to be so simple but I don't think mine is, nor do I think many of the people here with chronic brain fog will. I also might add, I'm skeptical of these instant solutions. A solution works when it occurs consistently, not just over a single day.

&#x200B;

**What is Brain Fog to me?**

In the mild form, brain fog comes to me as a non-modest sleep pressure. Unlike bedtime sleep pressure, there is a cloudiness to my thought and the inability to take in information or participate in external events. To clarify, at night time before I go to sleep, I can easily read and think. I feel ""tired"" but can work and study. With brain fog I can hardly work, I can read the same sentence again and again without it ever entering my head. If I can nap, which I do nearly every day, it tends to go away after.

&#x200B;

At it's more extreme forms I absolutely need to nap. I can be passive about work, but all my energy is in just trying to stay awake. I can't think, I can't study, I can't really work.

&#x200B;

Brainfog onset typically occurs \~2 hours after waking or later. Lunch can incite or worsen the effects. Fasting doesn't guarantee I don't have brain fog though. Sleeping 10-12 hours lessens chance or strength of brain fog during the day.

&#x200B;

**What have I done?**

1. Consulted my GP.
   1. Had blood work checked. Low Vitamin B levels which was corrected with a 1-a-day multivitamin. No change.
   2. Checked for Lyme, twice. Tested negative.
   3. Checked for allergies. Nothing serious to report
2. Sleep study for narcolepsy. Was too anxious and didn't fall asleep enough during the day time test to qualify. More important, my sleep architecture was non-typical of narcolepsy. No sleep apnoea or other issues.
3. Conquered my long-term depression. Through an anti-depressant and diligent CBT. Currently on the last week of the anti-depressant, lamictal, but brain fog was not affected by this medication.
4. Due to back troubles, I've visited the GP, back specialist, chiropractor, physical therapist, and acupuncturist. I still have issues, but my brain fog started years before the back injury happened.
5. Tried the Keto diet. It was only on it for a 3 weeks, but didn't notice enough difference to stay on. Might be worth trying again but due to travel and social circumstances it is very difficult and expensive for me.

**What are the routes to explore?**

1. Mental Illness\* \*
2. Anxiety\*
3. Back, Neck Issues\*\*
4. Diet and Allergy\*
5. Unknown cause of inflammation
6. Sleep Disorder\*\*
7. Infection\*

This list is more so for those starting out on their journey. They're things I've considered or am considering. I don't consider any category ""checked-off"", as there is always a possibility some test didn't catch something it was supposed to or etc.

&#x200B;

\*-Things I've looked into

\*\*-Things I've scratched off as much as possible for the moment

&#x200B;

**What is my current goal? Next goal?**

I continue to read more and more about brain inflammation and its relation to mental disorders like depression and chronic fatigue. My current goal starting today, September 6th, is to go through the rest of September taking supplements of sulforaphane. Sulforaphane is a chemical produced in dark leafy greens, most notably broccoli sprouts.

The supplement I'm using is Broccomax. I'll start with 3 capsules a day which gives approximately 24mg of sulforaphane, upping to 4-5 pills depending on results.

&#x200B;

A confounding factor is that I'm on my last week of anti-depressants and so there will be some withdrawal effects.

&#x200B;

If I don't see any results with this, I have a prescription of Nuvigil I have yet to try. It is my hope to stay off any type of medication, but as school starts in October, ideally I need to beat this before classes kick into gear.

&#x200B;

**Oddities and other info to note**

1. Caffeine has zero effect on me. Coffee, caffeine pills, etc. don't touch my brain fog or me. The only exception is when I tried to take too much caffeine in pill form to beat the fog that it gave me anxiety. I rarely drink coffee, never drink soda.
2. I wake up in the morning groggy, and unexcited about the day. I'm getting much better with CBT approaches and feeling great about life, but I do enjoy sleeping. However, a night of drinking results in me waking early with a clear head and a ready to start the day attitude, even if I have a headache from a hangover. I drink maybe 1-2 times per month, max. Never to absurd levels.
3. I am the most awake at night, between 21h -> 01h, even though I start to feel sleep pressure. I feel at these hours I'm at the level of mental alertness people normally are during the day. Most of my work gets done during this time
4. My naps are 2 hours long. Not shorter, not longer. Typically no issues falling and staying asleep at night.
5. I'm physically fit and exercise multiple times a week.
6. Tried the whole NoFap thing, besides 2 odd experiences, no change

1,Thinking of doing a survey,"After following this sub-reddit for a little while it seems to me that there are a few different underlying causes of fog, reflected in the fact that certain people find alleviation through the same methods, whereas others work or at least help other people.  
Since there's very little other research out there on this I was thinking of creating a survey to map out the nature of this across individuals, encompassing severity, additional symptoms, effective and ineffective treatments. Then with that info perhaps create a flow chart or report  type resource which allows people to pinpoint the best suited course of action for then.  
We have a small sample size here, but even 50-100 returns (less than 10% of the subreddit) would be very useful.  What do you guys think? Would you actually fill out out?

2,Intermittent fasting + NoFap (50% cured),"**\[\[\[ UPDATE IN A SEPARATE POST:** [**https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/a2694k/70\_cured/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/a2694k/70_cured/) **\]\]\]**.

**Hi guys**

.

I've felt pretty good now for about 6 days so I came here to tell my story

I've been struggling with horrible brainfog for about 3,5 years. Before that I had a mild brain fog for about 3 years.

.

.

**My symptoms are:**

\*horrible brainfog

\*almost non-existent short-term-memory

\*fatigue

\*insomnia

\*depression

\*pressure in the head

\*chronic neck pain

.

.

In general my life is very good, I have a full-time job, a lovely home, a lot of friend and a great family etc. It has been almost impossible to enjoy even a tiny bit of it. Almost every day has been struggling with this horrible brain fog, lack of mental clarity, memory problems etc. I'm a professional musician so my job definitely needs top-of-the-line cognitive function.

.

Atm no medication other than 3mg of melatonin. I've tried pretty much everything: medication, exercising, chiropractor, massage therapy, sleep study, diet (high fat - vegan) etc... My testosterone has been measured mid-low-end varying between 400-500. No major deficiencies in blood tests. My diet has been now gluten-free&plant-based for almost a year.

.

.

I've been figuring out that my brainfog is mainly due to insomnia, fatigue and chronic pain, I wake up tired and go all day in the zombie mode

.

.

Anyway now I've been 20 days on NoFap hard mode. After 2 weeks I started to feel a little bit more energy maybe due to increased testosterone. After this boost I made some research and found out that intermittent fasting might also be beneficial, so I've tried ""The Warrior Diet"" for 6 days now.... AND I feel pretty good for the first time in years! I would say my brainfog and energy levels are 50% better, it doesn't sound a lot but for me it a huge different. If this positive cycle continues, I think I can be cured completely in the future, at least it gives me hope. Of course the goal is to stick in to a sustainable lifestyle rather than a quick fix so let's see how this goes long-term.

.

.

Also this week I've been sleeping much better than in the previous years. Better sleep--> more energy --> less brainfog. This is how I see it. Also my neck pain has been much better. I've been completely alcohol free whole time.

.

.

In The Warrior Diet you only eat during certain 4 hours of the day. My eating window has been at 15.00-19,00. In the morning I drink only black coffee and other than that only water. I eat 3000-4000 kcals during my window so it is more than enough.

.

.

I talked to on doctor about my feelings yesterday and he told me that fasting in general increases your serotonin levels which results in better sleep.  Ofc serotonin is good for mental well-being as well. Fasting has been an ancient medicine for many diseases and it has been shown to help depression as well. It is no secret that the medical industry doesn't show any interest on researching on it due to lack of economical advantages.

.

..**In conclusion things that have helped me the most:**

\*intermittent fasting

\*nofap hard mode

\*going to sleep early

\*no alcohol at all

\*regular exercise

\*cold showers

\*fixing my posture (helped a lot with the neck pain)

.

.

There might be light in the end of the tunnel, I keep you guys updated!

All the best

3,What I would give for a normal day,"I am usually good at stopping myself from falling into a self pity spiral but I am having a bad day and wanted to indulge myself for a minute.. 

Who doesn't even feel human anymore? Remember when you would wake up and think, ""Hmm, what should I do today?"" There were so many possibilities. You go to school, you learn, you hang out with your friends, you pick up a book you love, you watch a movie with your family... there were just so many things to be enjoyed and to feel happy about... and I'm not talking about anything extravagant, just really simple pleasures in life ... With brain fog it's just ""How do I tolerate another goddamn second of this literal fucking hell."" What the fuck is a good day? What the fuck does it mean to enjoy something?  When you are battling this fog 24/7? I have gone from being extremely high functioning overachiever to struggling to watch a simple TV show. 

People around me constantly spout crap like ""I'm always here to talk!! It gets better!! Don't suffer in silence!!"".. then you try to talk to them about this and they give you weird looks and tell you to see a doctor BUT YOU'VE SEEN TONS AND THEY JUST TELL YOU IT'S ""ANXIETY"" so then everyone just thinks that you are making this up. Stereotypically depressed people don't get it either. So you are just left in this half-life... brain not functioning but not functioning so poorly that you actually have a diagnosable condition that could get treatment or at least be considered legitimate. 

 I put all this fucking effort in to just do the bare minimum. Running, obsessive healthy eating, mediation, blah blah blah. Honestly I'd be better off just doing drugs and hoping for a quick death.

0,Does anyone else's brain fog make them sound like a pseudointellectual,"When I developed brain fog I started experiencing depersonalization/derealization - I used to think that the brain fog was a symptom of DP/DR but now I believe that the brain fog is so severe that it causes me to feel depersonalized. It's like I can view every individual function of my brain because it has disintegrated into its separate parts. I have no overarching mental process to give me a sense of self - it literally feels like I have no thoughts. I avoid even participating in conversations because I know that anything that comes out of my brain has to be incorrect, just because my cognition really is so severely impaired. I try to explain this to people and they just say, ""If your cognition is impaired, then how can you analyze your thought process to this extent?"" 

???? Years of this shit and I still don't really understand it. I feel crazy most of the time. Funnily enough, I think I come off as relatively calm and stoic but it's really just because I literally have no mental activity.

1,Does anyone else still not trust their brain to work even when the fog lets up for a little while?,"Sometimes I’ll have periods of time where my brain fog symptoms improve substantially and I almost feel normal again, except for the fact that I’m still paranoid that my brain’s going to fail me. It’s like I’ve become overly critical of my own thought process, and whenever I have trouble thinking about something or thinking of a word I’ll freak out and immediately assume it’s my symptoms coming back (get even more paranoid) even though a lot of the time they’re not and it’s just a normal mistake. This is hugely less annoying to deal with than actual brainfog, but it’s still sucks to be scared all the time.

I feel like brain fog has fucked me up psychologically to the point where my life is still going to be difficult after it goes away.",9rhsp7,24.0,1.0,10.0,2018-10-26 04:59:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/9rhsp7/does_anyone_else_still_not_trust_their_brain_to/,0.0,0.0,2018.0,10.0
0,5 Years of Chronic Fatigue/ Brain Fog: Gone,"I suffered from chronic fatigue/ brain fog for the past 5 years. I was a heavy alcohol drinker in college and a heavy caffeine drinker after that.

I dealt with depression and anxiety due to my brain fog. I felt so disconnected from the world. Nothing “flowed” and I felt like I had no thoughts and too many thoughts at the exact same time. My eye sight was weak. And worst of all, I simply felt nothing.

Two years ago, I decided to quit drinking and that helped immensely! Then...

99 days ago I decided to give up caffeine (which I found was just masking deeper issues) and for the past 10 days, I’ve felt better than I have in my entire life. I wake up at 7am, hit the gym, have consistent energy throughout the day, and fall asleep easily at 10pm every night (except for Friday when I went to the strip club until 3am for my friend’s birthday lol)

Besides quitting caffeine I...

- Stopped eating gluten, added sugar, dairy, and soy (YES I HAVE HAD CHEAT DAYS...Don’t stress about it!)

- Drink Inner Eco probiotic every morning with Magnesium

- Eat loads of fermented foods (fermented foods and probiotics help reset your gut’s microbiome, which drastically effects how we think and feel)

- Exercise every morning (do what you enjoy and expect to feel tired...I’ve been weight lifting, I feel a lil tired after my lifts, then I get a second wind about 2 hours later which lasts throughout the day)

- Meditate every day (I started with 5 minutes, now I’m up to 1 hour - my mind is NEVER clear, don’t expect it to be - accept every though and just get excited that you’re noticing each and every one - if you haven’t meditated before, download the Calm App)

- Removed A LOT of things that didn’t make me happy - my job is hella stressful, so I cut my hours back, got rid of all my house clutter, and ended a 2 year relationship (it hurt so bad, but I knew it was for the best)

- Also, I realized that playing pickup sports really fills me up. So now I play a whole slew of sports with friends or go to the basketball courts any chance I get

Just know you will feel like complete shit at times and wonder why you can’t be like everyone else and get shit faced every weekend, or why your friend acts just fine after stuffing his face with cake, or why people that don’t go to the gym are perfectly happy. 

It sucks, but those people aren’t us. They just metabolize things differently. Were not broken whatsoever. It’s a blessing to have these things to work on because we learn so freaking much. And the feeling of improving is vastly better than any night binge drinking, or over eating, or any type of fix that just numbs the numbing pain.

1,Brainfog General Information Thread,"Greetings!

This is a sticky thread meant for collecting helpful information and resources about brain fog. If you have any useful information that hasn't already been posted, we encourage you to post it in the comments. The body of this post is not intended to be a complete list, but a beginning for commenters to add on onto.

If you are suffering from brain fog, you should consider consulting a qualified doctor, especially if your symptoms have appeared recently and suddenly and you are unsure of their cause.

**What is brain fog?**

Brain fog is not itself a medical condition, but an an umbrella term for a number of related symptoms that involve the sufferer's brain feeling slow and like it’s not functioning correctly, almost like it’s in a fog.

**Possible Causes**

Many things can cause brain fog. The nervous system is very intimate with the rest of the body meaning that a variety of health conditions can cause it to not function properly:

- [Hypothyroidism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism)
- [Sleep apnea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea)
- [Autoimmune diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease) (including celiac disease and gluten sensitivity)
- [Gastrointestinal issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_disease) (for example inability to digest certain nutrients)
- [SCT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sluggish_cognitive_tempo)
- [Anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety) or stress
- [lyme disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease)
- Environmental toxins ([often heavy metals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_heavy_metal))
- [Sleep deprivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation)
- Bad diet
- Drug use (excessive cannibis use can impair brain function)
- [Vitimin b12 deficiency](https://www.webmd.com/diet/vitamin-b12-deficiency-symptoms-causes)
- [Post Concussion Syndrome](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-concussion-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353352) (Many people don't remember getting injured because of amnesia!)
- [Neck Injuries and Atlas Subluxation](https://www.healthandstability.com/nucca-and-the-atlas-subluxation-complex/)
- [Chronic Fatigue Syndrome](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-fatigue-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20360490)

- [Candida (Yeast Infection)](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/guide/what-is-candidiasis-yeast-infection)
- Wisdom Teeth Problems
- TMJ

**Treatment**

The best treatment is trying to find the cause(s) of your brain fog. Start by identifying potential triggers in your daily life that seem to be correlated with your symptoms worsening. Then get yourself tested if possible, find any possible treatments, and see if your condition improves. Keep in mind that your brain fog might not have a singular cause, and you might find several treatments that help reduce it.

General things that might help combat brain fog and increase your overall well-being:

- Sleeping enough
- Having a healthy diet
- Nutrient Supplements (b12, d3, omega 3 and fish oil to name a few that may help)
- Trying to minimize stress
- Getting your blood tested, your brain scanned, and other clinical tests done to find possible anomalies in your body
- Chiropractic Treatment (Especially if you also have bad posture and/or neck pain)
- Nootropics
- Exercising
- Taking a cold shower

4,SSRI-induced brain fog,"I took Citalopram for a few years and stopped taking it a year ago. Since that time, nearly every mental task for me has been clouded with this sense of brain fog. I used to have a very sharp intellect and enjoyed reading all kinds of philosophical texts. Nowadays I just get confused when trying to read or write anything. Books and topics that I used to understand now don’t make any sense to me. It’s like this constant inability to really zero in on anything, instead my mind is just a haze. It’s very frustrating and it makes me sad to think I may have caused myself irreversible brain damage. Has anyone else experienced post-SSRI brain fog and does this ever go away? If not, what would you recommend I do to help recover? Thanks.",a0gurd,21.0,0.97,23.0,2018-11-26 06:23:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/a0gurd/ssriinduced_brain_fog/,0.0,0.0,,
5,Do I need help or am I just stupid?,"Everything seems difficult to me and like the title says, I can't tell if it's just because I'm dumb or if there's actually something wrong with me. I can't retain information, I forget what was said in conversations I just had, I don't remember anything from my childhood and I feel like I have disconnected from myself. My issues are getting in the way of my relationships and making me feel like a failure in school. 

For a long time I've told myself I'm just not trying hard enough or I'm lazy and don't use my head enough but now I'm 21 years old and I try so hard to be better and nothing changes. I've had about 6 concussion, 3 of them pretty serious, but I have no idea if that's actually relevant to my situation.

When I was young, I used to love reading and writing and in elementary/middle school I remember wanting to write for a career one day. Now I'm in college and it feels like I have 2 brain cells when I'm trying to write a single sentence. It's like everything in my head is blocking me from accessing my stored information. I know it's in there but it's all so muddy and sticky and I can't get to it. 

My boyfriend and my best friend are both so smart and I feel so stupid when I'm around them sometimes because it's like my brain is at half the capacity and ability they have. They can both recall things that they've read/watched so easily where I can barely remember it happening. I constantly feel like it's getting worse and I can't help but feel hopeless about my future. I love what I'm studying and I want so badly just to do well and graduate and get a job that makes me feel accomplished but a big part of me feels like that's not possible.

I've never had any kind of psychological assessment and I wouldn't even know where to start looking if I decided to get one but I feel like I should  because I don't want to keep living in the dark. I don't know if this is just a rant post or what I'm looking for. I've never really talked to anyone in my life about this before and barely even admitted it to myself, so I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest.

6,Greatly reduced my fog; here’s what I tried,"Went to the doctor and instead of just filling me with pills we tried some lifestyle adjustments.
I was having between 150-300g of sugar a day and he suggest cutting all added sugars for 2 weeks. This excluded natural sugars from fruit. I know my amount sounds like a lot, but just take a day and research your intake, I bet most Americans are close.

Day 1-2: Awful headaches

Day 3-5: just the regular shitty tired foggy feeling

Day6+: Slowly became sharper, more focused. Feel close to a real person again

I’m almost upset it worked so well, I love sugar so much. But if I’m being honest with myself, I’ve seen atleast a 40% improvement in my symptoms. Which is enough to live for right now. 
Because when my brain fog was 100% I seriously questioned if I could go on like this.

This is not a cure, this was just a sizable reduction in symptoms 

Give it a try or let me know if you’ve already tried it.

Edit: I guess I was misleading with just the ""sugar"" title. Avoiding anything that spikes blood sugar is the enemy, aka foods with a high glycemic index. Only eating carbs that have a low index helps my symptoms a lot. There are lots of resources online that have charts of what is good/bad for blood sugar, so start there.",9xp14o,20.0,0.96,15.0,2018-11-16 18:55:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/9xp14o/greatly_reduced_my_fog_heres_what_i_tried/,0.0,0.0,,

I know most of us struggle with motivation/sustained attention so I have tried to keep the questions simple. Should only take around 10-15 minute to complete.  Questions are designed to differentiate between different causes and treatment methods so would be helpful to get as many responses as possible. 

Am hoping for at least 100 responses which google forms will summate automatically. Will post the results here and perhaps use them to make a flowchart for newbies to this sub.

1,Were you previously very intelligent?,"I'm just wondering if people who developed brain fog happened to be unusually smart before? Does it make us more likely to notice cognitive changes? I'm mainly looking for people who have constant acquired brain fog (e.g. concussion), not brain fog from diet or lack of exercise as I think that is something subtler..

I was a very gifted student and my brain fog makes me seem ""average"" now which is frustrating - I basically operate as a different person now. It used to be very easy for me to process large quantities of information and now I get confused doing basic household chores. I don't even know if I would call this brain fog anymore but rather loss of intelligence.

Unfortunately, it means that psychiatrists and doctors don't take me seriously since my cognition seems ""fine"" - and I'm sure they believe that EVERYONE says they are really smart, that it's because the patient is just lazy, anxious, depressed, etc. It's hard to argue with them without coming off as neurotic and self-obsessed, which is why I am having neuropsych testing done.

2,EXTREME New Year's Resolution - BrainFog Cure,"Hello everyone

.

I've been suffering from mild to extreme brainfog more or less for 6-7 years and I've tried several protocols to overcome this disease. Now it's finally the time to put them all together at once and stick with it...

.

I feel a little better at times but far away from cured. Still foggy brain, foggy vision, bad memory,, pressure in the head, depression, inability think, chronic headache, insomnia, TMJ, neck pain, inability to read properly, etc..

.

.

These are my New Year's Resolutions to overcome my brainfog:

.

1. Diet: Whole Foods Raw Vegan
2. Wake up latest at 5.30 every weekdays, 7.30 on the weekends
3. Exercise everyday (or at least 15000 steps/day)
4. Intermittent fasting 16:8
5. No alcohol
6. No caffeine
7. Meditate everyday for at least 15 minutes
8. NoFap hard mode
9. Cold Shower every morning for 5 minutes (or ice swimming)
10. Hot shower (or Sauna if possible)
11. Breathing exercises every morning after waking up and evening before going to sleep (I'm gonna use Wim Hof Method which will take 4-6 minutes per 1 round, gonna do 2-3 rounds of these every morning/evening)

.

.

I will come back here after January and update how it is working for me:)

.

Good luck to everyone.

The worst part of brain fog is that there is no reprieve.

But for your THOUGHTS, your BRAIN to be permanently fucked? No one understands. Everyone just thinks I'm a hypochondriac. I feel so alone. Worried I'm developing a psychotic disorder or something.

5,"Update to my last post, I went to the gym and asked for postural correction exercise system, after exercises %50 of my fog is gone, it was there for years and I did every other thing to relieve it before.","I went to the gym straight after writing my last post, I told to the manager that I have these issues on my neck and back and my posture was like that for 10 years of gaming in front of computer, slouching and asked straight for best postural exercises. He said you will be so much in pain for 1-2 weeks because I gave you a hard core strengtening. Even tho I wasn't feeling anything wrong in my body while knowing I had a bad posture, because of the fog my senses were offline, I wasn't feeling my body or any pain at all, but it was full of tension that I realized after tension released with exercises. While I was doing an exercise machine called hyper, an energy like tension went out from my body, it's like I came to life in a sense,  I started to feel my body and grounded, I still feel weird in the head because I can feel the forward head posture creates distortions there, but my lower body opened up when I worked on that harmstring or glutes whatever and my %50 of fog lifted. My mind is clear then ever and I can't imagine how better I will be when I can sit in the right posture all the time and doing those exercises for a month. You can say fuck this, this is not true, you just exercised one time. Well believe me I didn't go to the gym or started to stretches for posture because I said are you fucking kidding me fog from posture? I'm intense meditator for 1-2 years, and my mind was always blank and foggy, I practiced everything, changed my self a lot to be able to live in that circumstance, but as the Elliot Hulse said, and it got stuck in my mind, then I started to chase this trail.""THE BODY IS THE MIND.""

I'm very sensitive to alcohol, caffeine and other substances. After a beer I feel really foggy and it's difficult to formulate sentences.  I thought that the SSRI medication caused the alcohol intolerance, but now I think that these issues are caused by other issues in my body, especially since I almost don't take anything of my medication anymore.

1,Possible opportunity to get to the bottom of your Brain Fog,"Let me start by saying, I see some people on this forum who have had Brain Fog, but have managed to cure it with a couple of vitamins over a few days, fully recovered. This isn’t me. If you think your condition could be something as simple as that, this post isn’t for you, but thank you for your interest.  

I’ve been living with this nightmare for approximately 2 years. I wouldn’t wish this debilitating illness (whatever we are calling this) on my worst nightmare. With that being said, it’s time for me to do something about it, and I think what would help me is to have help, support, insight, thoughts of other people who also want to help themselves. 

For good or for bad, I’ve spent a reasonable amount of time trying to diagnose this condition on Reddit/Google and have on many occasions found myself visiting r/Anxiety, r/Depression, r/BrainFog and r/DPDR. The issue is I just don’t know what the problem is. Some of you might be thinking, why not go and see a healthcare professional……Well, I have and I will explain more below. 

My Situation

It’s hard to say exactly when the brain fog started happening to me, I think to myself and say, how can you not remember when this started, and I still think this now. Truth is, I just don’t know, so the safest I can say is that it came on gradually approximately 2 years ago. I was working in a stressful and demanding job in a foreign country. I would feel the physical stress of the job like a weight on my chest. I had to get out, it wasn’t sustainable, I was only 26/27 at the time, but I feel like if I had of stayed any longer, I probably would have had a heart attack, I don’t think I am exaggerating here. I needed a plan to get myself out of this situation. The plan came in the form of quitting my job and going travelling. I went travelling South East Asia for 9 months. I may have had brain fog during this time, but I spent a lot of time in bars and developed an anxiety disorder out of nowhere, especially when travelling by bus, so I possibly attributed any problems to poor lifestyle at this point. Skip forward to when I got home, and moved back into my parent’s house, things really started to escalate from there. It was a particularly stressful time, my parents were going through a divorce, a certain female who I had travelled with was no longer talking to me, I had no direction in life and no job. Not a great time in my life, I struggled to sleep and, on some occasions, I relied on alcohol to get me to sleep and take what felt like a weight off my shoulder, in hindsight this was a really stupid idea, and I knew it at the time, but it happened and probably made me go off the rails even more. The brain fog was really bad during this time, a constant burden both physically and mentally.  

Fast forward to when I started to get a grasp on things and try to fix the issue of my brain fog. I live in the UK where we have for the most part free healthcare. Having never experienced brain fog before and not know what my condition was, it was difficult to even describe my condition to a healthcare professional. As not to arouse the parents that anything unnormal was happening, I told them I was experiencing sore heads on a daily basis. Right or wrong, to this day they are still unaware. I booked an appointment to go and see my GP for my brain fog and some other related issues that I believe were related to this, I’ll describe these below. I remember one night either before I had been to see a doctor, I was out walking my dog late at night, I had a panic attack. I hadn’t had many panic attacks before, I literally thought I was going crazy, probably the deepest, darkest night of my life. When I went to the doctor on my first appointment, she performed a number of tests, from checking pupil dilation, checking I could push here arms out with mine, inside ear visual check, but nothing obvious. She said she would run a full blood panel and see what was going on. She did mention high cortisol levels and Cushing’s disease, I’m not quite sure she had any ideas based on my symptoms what was the problem. One of the stranger symptoms I had at the time was erectile dysfunction. Looking back at it, I think this was probably just from the stress of the brain fog, this has for the most part cleared up. Fast forward a week, blood results in, nothing abnormal. I was like damn! It would have been much better knowing I had something, even if that something was not curable and would eventually lead to my downfall. Next step was to get an MRI scan. 

Unfortunately, I have a steel wire running through my jaw, so an MRI was not an option. However, I was given a CT scan, nothing abnormal there either. My last visit to the hospital was to have some blood work done and speak with a doctor. I explained how all these symptoms had worsened after returning from travelling. I had looked before and my symptoms matched closely with Lyme disease, at one stage I thought I had Lyme disease, having traveled through forests as well, this was a reasonable possibility. As well as tropical infection, they also asked about my sexual health while travelling and ran a full range of tests to determine if this may have been causing my brain fog. While all this was happening, I was plagued by Anxiety as well as the brain fog. I didn’t want to mention the anxiety to my doctor, because I didn’t want them to dismiss the brain fog and put it solely down to anxiety. The NHS is a great resource for people in the UK, but they are overworked and don’t have a great deal of time to spend on everyone. Fast forward a week, I go back to the hospital to talk about my results, nothing. From all the tests they ran, nothing was abnormal, this was probably one of my biggest fears. My doctor put it down to an anxiety disorder/depression. I didn’t think it was, I told him I had nothing to anxious over minus the brain fog. I walked out that day with a prescription for anti-depressants and a Beta Blockers to help with the physical sides of anxiety. I went home, thought about the anti-depressants, if this was a road I wanted to take. I went onto Google and checked out the particular brand I had been given, I was almost in shock. Stories of people who had been on this particular anti-depressant, the withdrawal symptoms they had been through. It scared me. I decided there and then this wasn’t the route I was going to take. I would try and do this on my own somewhat naturally. 
Skip forward approximately a year, I’ve tried various things with limited to no success. I want 2019 to be the year I beat this, so I’m looking for like-minded people who want to do the same. I’ve spent a reasonable amount of time on r/Anxiety, r/Depression, r/BrainFog and r/DPDR and one thing I’ve noticed is that there are a lot of people commenting on their specific situation, but not many people out there who have a plan or how they are going to tackle the situation. I’ve all but stopped visiting these communities as every time I visit I become less hopeful.  

Symptoms  

* Brain Fog – this is the best word to describe my situation, and I think the term brain fog sums it up very well. I do not have brain fog on a constant basis during the day, but I do have it pretty much every day. Weirdly enough, it usually starts around the same time each day between 11am and 1pm, I’m almost guaranteed to have brain fog during this time, and it continues intermittently throughout the day. The best way I can describe my brain fog is if I think of my brain as a pipe, there’s something blocking the full flow of this pipe, like a filter has been applied to it. My overall thinking grinds to a halt and I’m left with a feeling of numbness, like I’m physically here, but I feel like I’m 10% of the person I am is present, it feels as though I have the thinking capacity of 10% of my brain. It feels like a fuzzy pressure is inside my head. I can’t shake it no matter what I do. 

* Anxiety – at random times of the day, I feel anxious, especially on my own during the evening. I think the anxiety has caused more problems for me and made we withdraw from the normal life I once had. Travelling makes me very anxious in particular, were as previous I loved to travel. Going on a plane normally has me sat in a panic attack which I can’t control. Weird thing is, I don’t think I have any reason to be anxious, I’m not continually replaying thoughts through my head. Possibly thinking about the brain fog. 

* Tinnitus – I have a constant ringing in my ears, particularly when I try and sleep. This only started to occur from what I can recall when my brain fog was at it’s worst and hasn’t stopped since. This could of course be from exposure to loud noise, I’m not ruling that out, but it wasn’t the case before and I haven’t been exposed to loud noises to my knowledge since then. 

* Mild Depression – I’m pretty confident this is a direct result of the brain fog. Me continually thinking will I ever feel normal again and get back the life I once had.

* Sleep – I can’t go a full night without waking in the middle of the night, typically 4am, very strange. I always used to enjoy a deep sleep and it would take a lot to wake me, I was what you could call a heavy sleeper I suppose. This is a bit of a strange symptom, no matter what I do, I cannot sleep through a full night without waking up in the middle of the night. I often wonder if this is still jet lag from when I was travelling for 9 months. I also used to wake up and check my phone in the middle of the night and see if I had any messages from the female companion I was travelling, it could be all linked to that as she was in a different times zone to me. I know sleep issue’s is a possible sign of depression/anxiety. 

* Sensitivity to light and noise – I’m a lot more anxious to noise and sensitive to light than I’ve ever been before

How does the brain fog affect me? 

I’ll not spend too long on this one, but it has affected me in almost every aspect of my life. I work full time in a professional environment in a reasonably technical job and I need to have a sharp and focused mind. During a lot of my day I just can’t do this when I have brain fog, it’s almost impossible. Relationships have had a big impact as well, I seem withdrawn from relationships and find it hard to socialize with the brain fog. I feel like I’m being held back from the life that could have been, the dreams I have.  

Potential Reasons for my Brain fog:
This is just a list of things I have combined from the last 2 years that I think could be causing my brain fog, I think there is probably a few others I could add here but:

* Anxiety 
* Depression 
* Sleep Apnoea
* Hormone Imbalances 
* Diet/Allergies 
* Adrenal Fatigue 
* Teeth/fillings 
* Posture 
* Chronic Fatigue 
* Candida 
* Heavy metal poisoning 
* Vitamin deficiency 
* Tropical infection 

What I’ve done to address the problem?

* Meditation 
* CBT
* Elimination of certain foods (Dairy, caffeine etc) – I started on a * Keto diet during the new year. 
* Better sleep pattern
* Lower my alcohol – I almost don’t drink anymore 
* Smoking – I used to be a social smoker, but have all but eliminated this 
* Exercise – I exercise approx. 4 times a week, mostly lifting heavy weights – I struggle to add any muscle mass for a 28 YO male – this is what makes me think it could possibly be hormonal. I eat a well balanced diet and get plenty of protein.
* Vitamins: Cod liver oil, B12, D/3, probiotics, Zinc, Magnesium, ashwagandha
* Tested for diabetes 

What I’m planning on trying:
 
I have a list of areas I want to address in 2019 to see if anything helps or even remediates the brain fog, this includes but not limited to:
* Chiropractor consultation – I have paid for 2 appointments but have yet to book
* Hormone test – I’ve privately bought a male hormone test home kit that I plan on sending this week
* Exercise – specifically more cardio, at the moment I primarily lift weights and want to see if adding more cardio to my regime helps. I’m targeting a potential marathon this year, so this should be a good indicator. I decided to lift weights in the hope it would lift my T levels if they were low. 
* L-lysine/5 HTP – said to be good for anxiety 
* Diabetes – continue testing 
* Meditation – I started to meditate daily, but didn’t find it was help so this feel by the wayside, I would like to give this another attempt and be more persistent
* Coconut Oil – I’ve read good things about coconut oil 
* Keto Diet – continue keto diet, I’ve been on this for approx. 2 weeks at this stage – possibly eliminate some other foods from my diet. Eggs….
* Therapy 

Conclusion and where might you fit into this?

First of all, if you’re still reading, good job and thank you, it’s taken me a good few hours to compose this and I’ve had reasonable brain fog while doing so.
I’m looking for a handful of people, possibly 4, no more than 6 who want to take a journey with me with the intention/goal of beating their brain fog. How would it work? I haven’t a full plan made out yet, but I think people work better when they come together to solve a problem, and this is no different. Again, not limited to, but what I can think of right now:

* Gather a list of people interested in what I’m trying to do here who are willing to commit to this journey
* Complete a template with a list of specifics on you and your situation e.g. age, M/F, symptoms etc.
* Create an individual plan of how you want/think you can tackle your brain fog. 
* Share ideas on what you think might be causing your brain fog or what we can do to help 
* Have a regular (ish) discussion update with one and other on how they are progressing and if they have anything to share with the group. 

The reason why I have limited this to a handful of people, is because given the nature of Reddit and how many people are affected, it would be difficult to keep momentum with such a large number of people and have a constant feedback loop. Some people might think this is unfair or not in the best interests of everyone...? Rest assured, I will be continuing to post updates/progress on a reasonably regular basis on anything that I think can help others. That includes research, possible explanations to why brain fog is occurring, solutions etc.  

I don’t know if anyone will take me up on this, but I thought it would be worth a shot. I’m determined to beat this brain fog and am hoping that other people in the same position want to do the same. If so, hit me up with a PM and let me know a bit about yourself and we can talk. Given the nature of this post, I’ve created a new Reddit account. 

I stated above that I am not sure what the cause of my brain fog is, but I’m confident going onto anti-depressants and anxiety medication is not the right choice for me, at least not at this present moment. I want to fight this naturally or at least get to the root cause of why this is happening, I guess taking anti-depressants and anxiety medication runs the risk of covering over other symptoms or causing further issue’s down the line. 

So, if you’ve any interest drop me a PM and look forward to hearing from you. Good luck everyone with beating this. 

PS

I’ve probably left a reasonable amount of information out from this post, but, taking into consideration the complexity and time I’ve been experiencing brain fog, it would take me a long time to go into absolute detail. Also excuse any typos. 

*****UPDATE*******

Thanks everyone for the responses, some great input already. For all the ones who have said they are interested, I will drop you a PM in the coming days with how I think we should proceed and we can go from there.

2,Summary of survey results,"Thanks to all of you for making an effort to complete the survey- there's been around 150 responses in total. The results should be public now but if you haven't seen them here they are in PDF form. Google docs made some nice colourful graphs so thanks to whoever suggested that :)

I'm thinking that I'll go through the responses individually and eventually make a flow chart of the treatment methods which are most likely to help depending on the nature of one's symptoms - these responses largely show a few main archetypes. Regardless, its been nice to just see the fact that other people share the same symptoms/triggers laid out on a page. Hopefully this helps gives some ideas about potential strategies to try in future

And If you haven't filled it out yet, please do- there aren't many resources available for this condition so everything counts. Heres the link;

3,Integrative Doctor 6 week Protocol,"This post is going to be lengthy, but I'll try keep it structured because I know the struggle with reading is real.

I recently visited a doctor who specializes in complex illnesses,  chronic fatigue, and immunity. I think that the information and advice that he provided could be useful to those of you dealing with gut inflammation/issues in conjunction with brain fog. Will include the protocol for those interested in joining me

**MY SYMPTOMS;** We spent over an hour discussing these, will include so you can see if these are things you relate to.

**Emergence**:

* started around 2 years ago, following a very poor (90% bread) diet and some gastric infections.
* I had previously had my tonsils removed which the doctor says often precedes gut inflammation as they naturally act as a protective barrier to the gastrointestinal tract, trapping pathogens and whatnot.

**Severity:**

* Fluctuates from severe (feel brain is broken, no ability to mentally engage in tasks or conversation) to moderately annoying (dampened creativity and focus but not debilitating).
* Flare-ups for me generally worsened when stressed and after meals and when bad entail: dry irritated eyes, faster pulse, pressure headaches in the forehead region, slight vision issues, face, and body flushing, extreme fatigue which lessened after several hours, neuropathy, dizziness/low blood pressure when standing. At the less bad end, I get sluggish, emotionally flat and a bit fogged up.
* GI symptoms include bloating, gas, cramps constipation diarrheaa.
* Brain fog severity is improved by exercise and fasting and worsened by alcohol consumption.

**DIAGNOSIS AND PROGNOSIS**

* My brain fog is most likely an immune issue caused by a dysfunctional gut triggering mast cell activation (essentially a flu-like response when severe) and ongoing neuroinflammation, causing these cognitive problems
* Outlook is good, improvement will take several weeks to first be noted, and several months to be healed.

**THE PROTOCOL**

This is not a ""heal yourself in 6 weeks quick fix"" but rather a series of steps to take after which improvement should be visible. I have another appointment after 6 weeks to evaluate progress. The protocol outlines below entails recommendations I was given by my doctor and steps that I (and many of you) are already doing to reduce symptoms on a daily basis/

**Doctor's suggestions**

1. Blood testing; to check for celiac genealogy, full profile of inflammatory markers, methylation status.
2. Proper probiotic program. Many cheap probiotic pills are useless as they don't make it to the digestive tract intact. I was recommended to follow this program in order to improve gut flora. Strict adherence for min of 28 days necessary. [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8RwuuAjqnrPdXJGcm1ZRzJad3lQWHI0Tm9XMHItZDVpZTFv/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8RwuuAjqnrPdXJGcm1ZRzJad3lQWHI0Tm9XMHItZDVpZTFv/view?usp=sharing)
3. Stool testing; to check for SIBO and serious bacterial imbalance/pathogens. Will report back any noteworthy signs, but would recommend this testing to anyone in a similar boat. It's fairly mainstream now that the gut microbiome has become such a trendy topic in health circles.
4. A quality, animal-derived digestive enzyme, 2 to be taken with each meal or 1 with a light meal/snack. Properly digested foods reduce stress on the gastrointestinal tract.
5. Track all meals and reactions, create a list of things I am currently tolerating well vs not tolerating well. As symptoms improve the list of tolerated foods should expand naturally.

**Things to continue**

These are things which I have personally found useful and have been recommended to continue.

* Regular sleep cycle; this means sleeping at around 10-11 and waking up at around 6.30-7. Quality and regular sleep is crucial for immune regulation. It also helps with motivation and consistency which is generally lacking overall.
* Daily exercise; I find endurance cardio to be most beneficial but mix it up with weights and HIIT. In a fleeting window of motivation, I signed up for a half marathon as a way to keep me motivated to train and I have to say its worked.
* Diet;  sticking as close to meat and vegetables and fruits as possible, avoiding all foods which trigger flare-ups, which in theory sounds easy but in reality means me cutting out eggs/peanuts/high histamine and fermented foods/sugary things at least for these 6 weeks. If you find you react to fruits and vegetables, try center meals around meat as it seems to be the least reactive food group.  Individual food items to remove will vary but in general, cutting caffeine and alcohol is advisable due to the damaging effect they induce on the gut.
* Supplemets: its easy to go a little crazy here but I found the most helpful to be Ashwagandha. Took about a week of consistent dosage to notice its effect but it really helps with physical and mental energy. Its an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and therefore supports the immune system. I've found capsule doses are not sufficient and instead take 1-2 tsp of the powder daily.  I also regularly take fish oil and magnesium.
* Loose IF; As I exercise early, I don't like to wait until too late in the day to eat. Instead, I have my first meal around 9am, and don't eat after about 7pm- gives the gut some time to rest.
* Other things: I try to do sauna yoga a couple of times per week as I find this helpful. Deep breathing i.e Wim Hof would be especially advisable to those who cannot exercise due to its ability to reduce oxidative stress on the body.

Considering 1/3 of people on this subreddit noted that their symptoms improve when fasted, there are likely many people who would benefit from the aforementioned steps. In any case, the outlook seems to be positive, it just requires a consistent approach. If you want to follow along with these steps or would like an accountability buddy perhaps we could create a chat or do weekly check-ins.",agjyc4,25.0,0.95,7.0,2019-01-16 10:45:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/agjyc4/integrative_doctor_6_week_protocol/,0.0,0.0,2019.0,1.0

0,Don't let others gaslight you into thinking this is all the result of depression.,"If you believe that is the case for you, great.

For those of you that feel something different going on in your body, investigate. Get bloodwork done, switch your diet over to a healthier one, and cut out alcohol/caffeine. You'll need to make changes in the process of elimination but you're worth it. There's a lot science can't tell us at this moment in time because it's ever evolving. Just because your particular set of symptoms doesn't have a label doesn't mean it's automatically mental. 

Again, if that's what you are chalking your symptoms up to, great. You know your body best. But for the rest of us - don't give up. We'll find the solution someday. Focus on coping in the meantime (therapy can help) but don't let others gaslight you, they're not in your body. And especially don't gaslight yourself. xo",aouxhn,31.0,0.98,9.0,2019-02-09 18:20:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/aouxhn/dont_let_others_gaslight_you_into_thinking_this/,0.0,0.0,,
1,It's not just inside your head....,"Ok for someone who has been dealing with chronic brain fog for approximately 5 years I have literally tried everything to ""cure"" and get rid of this illness.
A little background story I  short... I had a neck injury from assault,fibromyalgia,insulin resistance,A very low vitamin d deficiency and Reactive Hypoglycemia and sinus issues.

Brain Fog check list:(if you haven't tested or spoken to your doctor already)
(P.s I am not a doctor so please do your own research,reddit should not be used for medical advise whatsoever and I can only talk about my experiences)

1) Vitamin D deficiency if this is low you can experience brain fog,headaches,dizziness,depersonalisation,muscle aches and a whole host of fun stuff.. with society not being a ""going out culture"" we have now become quite deficent  in essential vitamins.

2)Vitamin B12 deficiency  can cause brain fog and memory loss.

3)insulin issues can cause confusion and brain fog.

4)allergies such as coffee,cheese/dairy and aspartame can cause inflamation and as a result cause brain fog.

5)Black Mold can cause brain fog

6)gut issues such as leaky gut can cause brain fog

7)sinus issues can cause brain fog.

8)tethered spinal cord can cause brain fog.

9)injuries can cause brain fog

10)Ptsd can cause brain fog.


I am so determined to cure myself and I will not stop until I do so. I can't exactly suggest however you should realise that it is a journey, a frustrating one at that however! Please do your research and see if you need to get tested for any of the above which very well can help towards figuring out the cause.

I have currently went from keto to just straight up fasting in hopes my body will clear itself from any bad cells and repair and autophagy will begin.

0,After 5 years of agony and thinking I'd be like this for life - I FINALLY cured my brain fog.,"What a journey I have been on.  


I started getting brain fogs in early 2014, it hit me randomly at the gym. I had a feeling I was going to faint but nothing happened. Best way I can describe it is that feeling where you're sleep deprived and everything feels like a dream. Like my eyes are open but things feel blurry. I had no memory or depression issues though.   


I started off thinking it was Vitamin D, then that was knocked out (after taking tablets for months). Doctor then moved on to Iron, then that was knocked out (same process as Vitamin D). Lastly the doctor settled on B12, but that was also knocked out after I had a whole lot of injections with no result.   


Just to be clear, I had always been a healthy eater and a frequent gym goer.   


Beginning in 2012 I had been spending 90% of my day sitting down at home as an online student. So my posture had been horrible. I would get frequent shoulder spasms every few months.   


Finally, after a trip to an Osteopath I had discovered the source of my brain fogs. It was a neck issue that had developed from years of poor posture and the pain in my shoulders was merely radiating down from the neck. After months of rehab and exercise with the Osteo my brain fogs finally disappeared like a miracle.

4,The amount of times i am being told i have depression,"... Is actually giving me depression, lol..

&#x200B;

Being forced to see a psychiatrist again, it's actually so hard for me to speak, etc. With how debilitating life has become and this is just a waste.

&#x200B;

I have an endoscopy appointment coming up and honestly, if it says nothing im a little worried i'll break.. I encourage all of you to be strong regardless. I **like to think** I have a one of the worst cases of brainfog in the fact that i hadn't done a single thing wrong, yet most of my life (even like 8) was crying and abuse, etc. 

&#x200B;

Now i just have forceful, non-understanding parents i can't get away from etc. I have a girlfriend that i can't see as often as i want and when we're together we have the time of our lives but not as we should - I can't be myself and i can't comprehend things in the manner i should be allowed.

&#x200B;

I haven't touched alcohol, no recreational drugs, i was vaccinated and have made every effort to preserve myself as possible. And im 4 years and possibly longer into this, and im not even 20.

&#x200B;

To put it simply to you all, there is something wrong with you to have brainfog, whether its lifestyle, a deeper condition, birth defect, whatever it is. There's nothing artificial about these problems.. There are concrete, biological reasons. I **believe** mine was hidden for so long. I mean i got to a stage where i thought tinnitius and feeling like a 90 year old being sucked dry and sort of having yourself sucked up more and more from the inside was normal! And then when i started ""realising"" brainfog, i began trying lots of shit.

&#x200B;

But i missed something that was just so ridiculous.. I was always in stomach pain.. and i'm very emotionally strong so i literally ignored it to the extent where i just forgot it exists and that it couldn't be the issue..

&#x200B;

I've come so far now.. blood tests, MRI scans, stool tests, liver test thyroid test full blood panel, all this shit, and yet i didn't test my stomach, the only test i did was recent and that was for H.Plorhi which came back fine.

&#x200B;

The point is, if you really just ""de-cloud"" almost like meditation, just listen to your body, don't shout at it, don't demand a response to this madness, do what i used to do and also did to find this cause.

&#x200B;

Its a decently known strategy, everything happens for a purpose, when i used to have panic attacks i'd try and fight them, eventually, i just welcome them with open arms, hugging them and welcoming them, i wasn't scared of them i was just trying to understand them, and thats kind of what you have to do to figure out your source of fog.

&#x200B;

The take-away is, don't focus on your brainfog like i did, yes, it might be the only thing you want gone, but just because **you** don't think another problem (in my case my stomach pains, etc.) is ""worthy"" of causing such a problem, doesn't mean it isn't actually causing it.

&#x200B;

The search and destroy methodolgy works best in fixing brainfog, just take all your problems, tooth hurts? get it checked and sort that, get restricted movement in your arm? speak to your doctor and get it x-rayed. The problem is, brainfog really kills us down and in doing so, problems can just pile and so it will get harder to diagnose. Don't focus on brainfog, focus on trying to find the thing causing it. I advise dealing with physical symptoms before looking at physological symptoms, as they might be linked to physical symptoms. 

&#x200B;

Wish you all the best, hope atleast one of you got helped via my brain-splatter, best and honest intentions for you all.

&#x200B;

There is a lot of unstructured information in this sub-reddit, a lot of ""lets give up posts"", etc. And i have made it my goal when i get out of this to try and make a mega-document of explainations, things to try, methodologies, etc. Meanwhile i hope you all can hang in there.",bcfrpz,30.0,1.0,7.0,2019-04-12 16:46:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/bcfrpz/the_amount_of_times_i_am_being_told_i_have/,0.0,0.0,,

0,How I cured my brain fog:,"My theory for the main cause of my brain fog: 
Excess fermentation in the gut/overgrowth of histamine producing microbes in the gut, leading to excess histamine in the blood, combined with nutrient deficiencies in the nutrients needed to break down histamine.

By keeping a food log I realised that yoghurt was a trigger for me (increasing fermentation in gut? The probiotics increasing histamine or promoting histamine producing bacteria? The fodmaps?). 
After realising yoghurt made me feel worse I cut it out completely, and reduced my consumption of fodmaps. Fodmaps are carbohydrates that are easily fermented in the gut (examples include wheat, milk, onions, apples etc). I also found eggs to be a trigger for me so cut them out completely. I didn’t avoid all fodmaps I just reduced my consumption, and made sure the staple foods of my diet were low fodmap or fodmaps tolerated well by me. The bulk of my diet is rice, potatoes, meat, fish, low fodmap fruit and veggies, and nuts. I still eat wheat and a little dairy.

Nutrients that may be helpful for someone suffering from excess histamine are Vitamin C, b6, magnesium, copper, zinc. Try and make sure you find staple foods for you that are high in these but do not cause excess fermentation in your gut. For me these were lots of cashews (these are loaded with magnesium, copper, zinc, and iron). I eat at least 30g a day. Also oranges (vit c), red peppers (vit c, quercetin), unripe bananas (b6, magnesium).

This led to significant improvement in brain fog, but when I tried supplementing b6, it had a big effect on me. It improved my mood, reduced my social anxiety, and reduced brain fog significantly. However supplements can be a double edged sword, I supplemented zinc for a long time and it actually made my brain fog worse (probably by depleting copper or magnesium). If you find a vitamin or mineral gives you some improvement, be wary that minerals and vitamins compete for absorption and supplementation can lead to too high levels of a vitamin or mineral (too much b6 can lead to nerve damage). Take the minimum needed to give you the improvement, always try and reduce the dose if you can. I take about 20mg  B6 most days.

Interestingly if you read articles on common deficiencies in people with adhd, they are very similar to the ones I listed above. Also food sensitivities can cause adhd symptoms.
https://www.nhs.uk/news/mental-health/adhd-children-should-have-diets-assessed/

Maintaining good posture and avoiding mouth breathing is also beneficial (increasing blood flow and improving oxygenation in brain?). Also note the link between mouth breathing and adhd.

I also significantly improved my sleep by not eating 3-4 hours before bed. This also had a big effect.

Sorry it’s a bit long but in summary what I did to completely cure my brain fog:

Keep a food log to identify sensitivities (most common being wheat, dairy, eggs, corn, soy), Eat a lower fodmap diet, Eat nutrient dense foods high in the nutrients listed above, Experiment with b6 or other supplements (I am going to try b2 soon), Maintain good posture/correct forward head posture, Don’t eat 3-4 hours before bed

Hope this helps :)

2,My Brain Fog Recovery Story,"Hi, everyone. I guess I’m what you’d call a survivor of brain fog, so I figured I should share my story. I know this is a little lengthy, so feel free to skip the first couple sections.

&#x200B;

**1) Onset**

&#x200B;

My fog was triggered by a highly stressful experience in 2017 while staffing a summer camp. Basically, I made a bad decision and became terrified that I might get found out. I figured it would all be okay in the morning, so I went to sleep. I woke up very tired and foggy, almost like I was high. I assumed I just needed some food and water and to wake up a little more. But as my day began, the feeling didn’t go away. My sense of touch was very numb and i felt distant from people. The best description I could give people was that I felt like I was in a dream. I made sure to drink a ton and eat healthy that day, but whenever I’d begin to do an activity, I nearly felt like fainting. I couldn’t process my surroundings as well; it was like my brain was on battery-saving mode.

I tried to function as normally as I could, but everyone at camp knew something was off with me. I talked to the nurse and everything, she just told me to drink water and take it easy, check for tick bites. I went the whole day feeling completely useless and out of it, but it was just one day, so I went to sleep.

The next morning, I woke up feeling okay, and I was ecstatic. That is until I sat up. Once I began to put my shoes on, I realized I couldn’t tie my own laces. It took a good few minutes to pull myself together and very meticulously get my clothes on. I felt the same as yesterday. I instantly became frustrated and sad—I didn’t want to be a useless blob anymore. I tried so hard to persevere and could fake it mostly, but after a few hours, I left the building where I was supposed to be watching some kids and began sobbing outside. I put my earbuds in. I felt utterly hopeless. I began to feel tingly and my breathing became uncontrollable. This was a panic attack. Whatever this monster was inside me, it was fucking me up. My friend came outside to comfort me, but I didn’t even know what to tell him. I ended up asking him to leave. I didn’t want to be alone, I just wanted to understand what was wrong with me.

The remaining few days of camp were a blur, but I made it out alive. I told my mom what was wrong with me. Unfortunately I had a family trip immediately after camp. I was still miserable, but a change of scenery was good. My whole family commented on how tired I seemed. I didn’t bother going into a further explanation, so I agreed saying that camp tired me out. We did an escape room, and god did I feel so stupid and useless once again. I’m not a dumb person and I’m relatively good with puzzles, so it was really tough seeing how different I was. I had become a lesser version of myself.

It had been almost a week of fog at this point, and I had noticed that the more stressed out I became, the worse my fog got. So I started focusing on staying calm and distracting myself. And it actually sort of worked. My fog started gradually fading. By the time I was at my next camp, about a week after the first one ended, I worked so hard on ignoring it that it went away.

&#x200B;

**2) Continuation**

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, that’s not where my story ends. Another couple weeks later, I was in the car on my way to another trip. A trip I was a little nervous for because I didn’t know what it would be like and it was with people I was unfamiliar with. And on that car ride, my fog came inching back. By the time we reached our destination, I was fully submerged. It was so goddamn hard to interact with people. It felt worse than the last time. I couldn’t feel myself. I took naps daily. Skipped activities. Skipped meals just to see if it would change anything. I didn’t want to be there. I didn’t want to be in my body anymore. I had a moment where I was outside and I looked up at the leaves shifting in the breeze and I realized I wasn’t myself anymore. It was then that I also realized that I wanted to die. I would rather die than continue to live my life like this.

I didn’t attempt or anything, but I seriously thought about it. I decided I should wait to see if I could learn anything about whatever my condition was.

&#x200B;

**3) Doing Something About It**

&#x200B;

We got back home and I immediately saw a doctor. I was tested for a dozen different things, all negative. I tracked my meals and my heart rate and blood pressure every day to try and find a pattern myself. I searched everywhere online, finding some similar symptoms like in depersonalization, but nothing that matched perfectly.  School was horrible, as I know many of you can relate to. It becomes so difficult to act completely normal when you know you're not yourself. Panic attacks weren't rare anymore, the simplest tasks now requiring meticulous thought; the only thing you can understand clearly is that your life is falling apart.

Though I couldn’t yet find an answer, I made sure my doctor knew how much my life was being fucked up by whatever this was. She decided I should go to therapy.

I was basically an expert at describing my condition at this point: my sense of touch goes numb, I can’t process things or think as well, it’s hard to communicate and empathize with people, i can no longer predict people’s movements as I walk down a crowded street; I’m less spatially aware, I can't focus, I feel disconnected from reality. Essentially, I feel like I’m stuck in a dream. This and more is what I told my new therapist. I had no belief that therapy would actually do anything for me. In fact, i was most fogged while at therapy because I would have to think so hard while interacting with someone.

&#x200B;

**4) Getting Better and Understanding my Fog**

&#x200B;

The first few weeks of therapy, it was just hard. It stressed me out because I knew I would leave a therapy session more fogged than when I went in. But as time went on, I realized it was nice once we started talking about things other than my condition, like the other things that had been causing me anxiety. The main pattern that me and my therapist noticed about my condition was that it comes in waves, getting heavier the more stressed or tired I am. So talking about my anxieties and creating solutions to those problems actually helped push my fog away. The next pattern we noticed is that I do better when I am distracted and comfortable, but I shouldn’t over-stimulate myself. When I had a big event going on--like performing in a play--my fog would come back. And when I felt my fog coming, I would take some time to calm myself down and do something like homework or text someone.

I was diagnosed with anxiety, which made a lot of sense to me. I’d say about 7-8 months after my initial onset, I was significantly better. I would no longer get stressed when i noticed fog, instead staying calm, knowing that it will get better if I believe it will get better. Eventually my bouts of fog almost disappeared entirely. I can now go weeks or even months without feeling any fog. I found something online that I believe describes my fog perfectly. It’s called Chronic Derealization. That is what I I unofficially diagnosed myself with. Dodie’s video is what made me realize this. I burst into tears to hear someone describe what I had. I wasn’t alone anymore [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfOHh5mt9SM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfOHh5mt9SM)

&#x200B;

**5) Final Notes**

&#x200B;

I know everyone’s fog is different, but if you can afford to go to therapy, I would highly recommend it. Derealization is actually a very common symptom of mental disorders like anxiety and depression, it’s just not normally chronic like it is for a lot of the people on this sub.

The most important advice I could give to everyone here is to not give up. The more negative you are, the worse your fog might get. In order to get better, you have to actually believe you can get better. I know it sounds stupid and cheesy, but you have to have faith. Once you defeat your fog, you’ll look at the world with a whole new appreciation.

I decided to post here because my boyfriend introduced me to it. He is also a victim of brain fog, but has it a little differently than I did. I’m working to help him with his fog, and I hope this can help some of you all. I wish everyone here luck in their recovery and acceptance.",bt04aw,24.0,0.92,16.0,2019-05-25 21:51:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/bt04aw/my_brain_fog_recovery_story/,0.0,0.0,,
3,Cure to Brain Fog,"Hey guys I've been through hell with this and I know how it feels. It is probably the worst form of pain I can think of mentally. But finally a week ago I felt it lifting and today I feel tremendously better, almost normal. First you need to put yourself in a non stressful environment, do things that you like doing, and music can actually help. As well. Now change your diet to water and very high vitamins and clean lean protien. Exercise daily and be in good physical shape. Start learning about things that interest you. Start trying to remember things throughout the day about the day before or previous things in that day often. Give some days to completely let go of your responsibility and do fun shit with your friends. Most people on here have gone to doctors and the doctors have no clue. I'm telling you it's a mixture of your brain being off balance due to drugs or alcohol of some sort, depression, anxiety, etc...

4,Lets talk about the Sternocleidomastoid...,"I've been having intermittent brain fog since the first of the year. Really high stress levels seemed to trigger it and as it subsided it never fully went away. Symptoms:

* Some mental fog
* occasional headache on left side above ear
* sinus pressure
* forehead pressure above eyes
* slightly blurred vision
* lots of tension at the base of my skull/upper spine

I found a post that was about 6 years worth of running comments [here](https://www.ourhealth.com/conditions/head-conditions/head-pressure-spaced-out-foggy-dizzy-fatigue-top-neck-ache?p=20#AAAAVLBAt47KV62T8w5wAA) . Through that I found a few things that stuck out to me. Lots of these people had all the same side effects and tended to all come back clean for anything after mri's, blood tests, etc. Many people had the same symptoms and the upper neck seemed to be a common thing. I've talked to some people on here and have a lot of feedback. I've also read a lot of people go to a chiro. Some with great results. Some, not so much. I've found from experience and research that the Chrio's quality can vary tremendously. So, I think, if this is the problem, that many may miss this issue.

I've learned that the Sternocleidomastoid (a major one) is a muscle, along with a big group of muscles, that tend to go in every direction on the neck. They go into the collar bone, shoulder, between shoulder blades, beside spine, and all generally meet at the base of the skull. The most interesting thing is this [link](http://round-earth.com/SCM.html) . It says that these muscles rarely produce much pain like a traditional muscle. They tend to send pain signals to the forehead, sinuses, base of skull and affect nerves that cause vision problems, headaches, jaw pain, tinnitus, and many other issues. 

The chiro was able to really stretch my neck out last time and that muscle on the left was really sore. Today, my 2nd visit, the massage therapist did about 5 different stretches, that I think were active release techniques, on each side. Not going to lie they sucked pretty bad. It was a very bittersweet type of pain. Hurts so go haha. But, some of those muscles were absolutely awful. Very sore and tender. She even said my left SCM muscle was very inflamed and knotted up. They all agreed that this could cause brain fog and issues as such. I asked what I did to make this happen and my chiro said that it was partially due to my build, could've been triggered by an accident, stress is a huge contributor, forward head or bad posture, repetitive motions, working at a desk. The list was very long and he said each additional thing can compound it and make it worse. 

The most interesting fact to me was the massage therapist said the technique she was doing (she would hook or pinch the muscle and I would turn my head stretching it) would cause my body to react different than a normal stretch. Those muscles not only support the head, but also will tighten up and semi permanently contract to protect your spine. Its a type of body reaction that we don't really control. They tense up because intuition tells the muscles that whatever is causing the issue will happen again and its best to be safe vs sorry. So the stretch where I tuned my head will cause my body to realize it can stretch this muscle farther and over time its more apt to release. I don't know the science, but it seems to be legit. 

I will keep an update on how this pans out, but all the evidence lines up to make me think this could be a very probable cause that flares up with stress because the stress hormones will trigger a muscle reaction making it worse. Stress hormones are higher in the morning and I tend to have this when I wake up sometimes as well.",brblc3,24.0,0.92,8.0,2019-05-21 15:12:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/brblc3/lets_talk_about_the_sternocleidomastoid/,0.0,0.0,,
5,Brain Fog General Information Thread,"Greetings!

This is a sticky thread meant for collecting helpful information and resources about brain fog. If you have any useful information that hasn't already been posted, we encourage you to post it in the comments. The body of this post is not intended to be a complete list, but a beginning for commenters to add on onto.

If you are suffering from brain fog, you should consider consulting a qualified doctor, especially if your symptoms have appeared recently and suddenly and you are unsure of their cause.

**What is brain fog?**

Brain fog is not itself a medical condition, but an an umbrella term for a number of related symptoms that involve the sufferer's brain feeling slow and like it’s not functioning correctly, almost like it’s in a fog.

**Possible Causes**

Many things can cause brain fog. The nervous system is very intimate with the rest of the body meaning that a variety of health conditions can cause it to not function properly:

- [Hypothyroidism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism)
- [Sleep apnea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea)
- [Autoimmune diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease) (including celiac disease and gluten sensitivity)
- [Gastrointestinal issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_disease) (for example inability to digest certain nutrients)
- [SCT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sluggish_cognitive_tempo)
- [Anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety) or stress
- [lyme disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease)
- Environmental toxins ([often heavy metals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_heavy_metal))
- [Sleep deprivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation)
- Bad diet
- Drug use (excessive cannibis use can impair brain function)
- [Vitimin b12 deficiency](https://www.webmd.com/diet/vitamin-b12-deficiency-symptoms-causes)
- [Post Concussion Syndrome](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-concussion-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353352) (Many people don't remember getting injured because of amnesia!)

- Wisdom Teeth Problems
- TMJ
- Tethered Cord Syndrome
- ADHD and Sluggish Cognitive Tempo
- Lactic Acidosis
- Depression

**Treatment**

The best treatment is trying to find the cause(s) of your brain fog. Start by identifying potential triggers in your daily life that seem to be correlated with your symptoms worsening. Then get yourself tested if possible, find any possible treatments, and see if your condition improves. Keep in mind that your brain fog might not have a singular cause, and you might find several treatments that help reduce it.

General things that might help combat brain fog and increase your overall well-being:

- Sleeping enough
- Having a healthy diet
- Nutrient Supplements (b12, d3, omega 3 and fish oil to name a few that may help)
- Trying to minimize stress
- Getting your blood tested, your brain scanned, and other clinical tests done to find possible anomalies in your body
- Chiropractic Treatment (Especially if you also have bad posture and/or neck pain)
- Nootropics
- Exercising
- Taking a cold shower
- Meditation
- Wim Hof breathing

6,An ant-acid took away my brainfog?,"Hi guys, I just want to share with you how I cured my brain fog.

Been suffering for years with brain fog where the symptoms were: drunk feeling, pressure in head, no short term memory, lethargy. The symptoms would seem to be worse after eating and excercising. After a days work I would drive home with my mind feeling completely fried unable to think of anything coherent. Cutting out certain foods also never helped

I have always had an active lifestyle, didn't smoke, do drugs or eat particularly unhealthy. But I had the worst brainfog, was really making me depressed, even got diagnosed with ADHD (hypo) by a psychologist specialising in add. 

Anyways, I took an ant acid one day, brands name was gaviscon, and I noticed my symptoms miraculously disappeared. Two days afterwards no symptoms, the it came back again, took some more ant acid and it went away. 

Every morning before work id take a sip, less than the recommended dosage and I havent felt that drunk, head pressure feeling ever again.

Side symptoms of hemorrhoids and feeling bloated has also disappeared completely.

I know ant acids can wreck your stomachs ph levels and cause problems, but using lower than recommended dosages I havent had any sideffects. Also, Ive never had the ""this stuff isnt working need to up the dosage"" feeling

I would definitively encourage someone with similar symptoms to try it,but if it doesnt work for you, leave it and continue your search.",bq55qx,22.0,1.0,28.0,2019-05-18 15:25:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/bq55qx/an_antacid_took_away_my_brainfog/,0.0,0.0,,

0,How fixing my posture cured my brain fog,"Hello people. I want to share with you my solution to my brain fog. I had it for about 2 years and it really messed up my concentration and focus. Although I still manage to pull off stellar grades in my first 2 years of college, I absolutely hated it. It's a weird feeling where you live in this auto-pilot mode where life is just drifting away. I remember that this all started when I developed a forward head posture from carrying a super heavy backpack in high school. With this piece of information I started thinking whether my posture was causing my brain fog. I tried eating a super clean diet and doing cardio but that did not help. Hack I even got an MRA to see if I had an artery dissection in the back of my neck which came back fine. I began to realize that when I force myself to sit upright my brain fog improves dramatically. So, I decided to do some posture exercises for a week and it literally improved my brain fog by 90% (I'll have the exercises down below). I got to 100% by supplementing with lion's mane capsules (may have been just a placebo effect and I was probably 100% cured from just the exercises alone). It has been 3 weeks with no brain fog and I will update you guys monthly on if my brain fog comes back or not.

1,I fixed my brain fog!,"Hey guys!

Over the past two years, I've been struggling immensely with brain fog and a host of other symptoms that were having an incredibly detrimental impact on my life. After visiting eight doctors over the course of this time, I was finally diagnosed with a medical condition called Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), and subsequently treated with medication. While my experiences and condition very well may not generalize to nearly everybody here, I thought it would be helpful to discuss some of what I went through, and all perhaps I can give a bit of information into what POTS is. (Edit: While I mention this later, the mean age of diagnosis is around 20 years old, and much more commonly in women. The disorder is relatively rare (roughly one in a thousand), but if you started developing symptoms around this age, I might consider POTS slightly more heavily). 

Around the age of 18, roughly two years ago, I began getting oddly fatigued, despite getting full night sleeps. This soon spiraled into a host of other symptoms:

\-Extreme and debilitating fatigue.

\-Brain fog. For me, this essentially includes but is not limited to moderately severe issues with information recall, concentration,  focusing, and reasoning.

\-Tension Headaches. Essentially I would get headaches towards the front of my head that felt almost as if somebody was gripping my head and squeezing it. Tylenol helped, although I was wary of taking it too frequently.

\-Dizziness. This was a more mild symptom, and I never realized I got dizzy more than average until it was pointed out to me by a friend. I would often, although not always, get dizzy when standing up or stretching, as well as in times of stress and in even with the most mild consumption of alcohol. This did occasionally escalate into fainting, although rarely.

\-Exercise Intolerance. Once more, this was a very mild symptom for me, as my case of POTS is on the milder side. I could indeed go out for a jog, although I noticed that I always seemed to get out of breath much quicker than other people did in normal scenarios. I took this just to mean that I was out of shape (although I do get a fair amount of exercise daily) and didn't realize that this was abnormal until recently.

\-Tremors. These typically occurred in my hands and neck, and were often (although not always) brought out in times of stress. This is a symptom of POTS, although given their correlation with my anxiety, it is possible they are not symptomatic of my condition.

\-Skewed hunger and thirst. In general, I would be extremely thirsty constantly, despite being very well hydrated. Likewise, I would rarely feel hungry.

In general, I found that these symptoms would get worse or better under certain conditions:

\-My symptoms were usually worse in the morning, and best at night.

\-My symptoms were usually significantly better when laying down as opposed to standing.

\-Some foods made my symptoms worse. I am diagnosed with lactose intolerance, and any dairy would exacerbate each one of my symptoms. Likewise, and while I am not certain of this, it appeared that fructose, as well as some artificial sweeteners, would also make my symptoms much worse.

Over the past two years, and especially the past 9 months or so, these symptoms had an incredibly detrimental impact on my life; I felt awful constantly and was living day to day, my grades in school suffered which may have a large impact on my admissions to graduate schools, my social life decreased dramatically, I was an avid musician yet completely unable to play brass instruments, and so on.  Were it not for personal reasons, I would have taken a leave of absence this semester from school.

Over the course of these two years, I went to countless doctors and medical providers: two primary care physicians, a nurse practitioner, a neurologist, two cardiologists, a somnologist, and behavioral therapist. I was told I had anxiety, that I had sleep problems, that I had allergies, and was tested for a variety of disorders. However, nothing showed up in my blood, so my doctors were clueless. Eventually, via my own research, I discovered POTS, and eventually went to a cardiologist who was able to test me for it, and eventually diagnose me with the condition.

For those who are curious about the disorder, here is an incredibly thorough description of it, which I obtained from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3390096/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3390096/).

“Patients with POTS experience a variety of symptoms ranging from mild to severe. The most common underlying condition is cerebral hypo-perfusion, which might be due to excessive tachycardia, neurological dysfunction or other idiopathic causes.\[5\] These symptoms include: light-headedness, fatigue, diaphoresis, tremor, palpitations, exercise intolerance, near syncope and recurrent syncope on upright posture.\[5\],\[7\] Patients with POTS may complain of exacerbation of symptoms after simple activities, such as eating, showering or low-intensity exercise, associated with a high degree of functional disability.\[8\] POTS patients may also suffer from mental clouding (“brain fog”), blurred vision, shortness of breath, early satiety, nausea, headache and chest discomfort;\[8\] Other symptoms include anxiety, flushing,\[9\] postprandial hypotension,\[9\] lower back pain,\[10\] aching neck and shoulders,\[10\] cold hands (and often feet & nose),\[11\] and hypovolemia.\[11\]”.

While my experiences were not nearly as broad as to include every symptom listed above, I did experience many of the above symptoms, as I noted earlier.

After I was diagnosed with POTS, I was prescribed a (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) called sertraline, which is one of the many medications used to treat POTS. It is a slow action medication, and sure enough, not much happened besides some pretty nasty side-effects for the first few weeks. However, slowly but surely, both the side-effects and the rest of my symptoms started disappearing. As of approximately one week ago, which was roughly the 6-week mark of the commencement of my medication, I was able to say that not only did I feel better, but I felt *completely* better. Not one of my symptoms remains. The fatigue, brain fog, dizziness, and so on are all completely gone.

I never imagined that I would ever feel normal again and resigned myself to having to slug my way through the remainder of my life, yet here I am. This was an incredibly stressful period in my life, and I did visit this Reddit occasionally through this period. While I wasn't ever able to come away with all that much from it, I did promise myself that if I ever resolved my symptoms, I would post my story to here so I can help prevent people from going through the hell I endured for the past two years.

I genuinely don't know if this post will get much attention at all, though please be warned that I am not an active Redditor if people have questions for me. I will try to respond if anybody wishes to have more details from me, but I cannot anticipate that I'll be checking all that frequently. Hopefully, however, this was able to help or at least inform some people, and I wish you all luck with your struggles! It's really not fun going through this, but I expect that for many of you, your symptoms will improve . For me, it took years, but eventually I discovered there was *something* causing all this.

As some final notes, I did come across other interesting things in my research that people may wish to look into. Primarily, and while I didn't have this in the end, I considered the possibility that I had fructose malabsorption. It is not nearly as well documented as POTS, but there are people who complain of brain fog with this, and I'm not sure if I've seen fructose malabsorption mentioned on this Reddit. One interesting source is a blog ([http://lifewithfructosemalabsorption.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2011-12-14T09:39:00-05:00&max-results=7](http://lifewithfructosemalabsorption.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2011-12-14T09:39:00-05:00&max-results=7)) in which the writer and her family struggle and give tips in their dealing with this issue and the brain fog associated. Also, if anyone has any more interest in POTS, here are some interesting research papers and news articles I found. I apologize if you are unable to access these articles, but there is a variety of other information across the web.

3,Something that helps tremendously and may be the source of my (and your) brain fog,"Shallow breathing. I have gotten into the habit of breathibg into my chest and I haven’t felt like I can take a deep calming breaths in a while. It may be from sucking in my abdomen for aesthetic purposes or from stress/something else but I’m not breathing all the way down into my belly. I tried to start doing these deep breathing exercises (not necessarily wim hof) but rather where my shoulders are back (i have somewhat forward slouched shoulders from doing too many chest workouts in comparison to back/upper back pulls and from sitting in chairs leaning over etc.) and i try to breathe deeply into my navel (two inches below belly button) and not moving chest at all. It is hard at first but the muscles around there start to loosen up and it becomes a bit easier to breath deeply. My stomach/gut will start to make weird noises and it feels like something releases as if there was a blockage like organs smushed together which is why it’s important to do this with correct posture. I found someone with a similar issue and it’s just like this https://youtu.be/UJq3x05QwNM 

Anyways i got to the point where i felt like i had taken my first natural deep breath in a while and things cleared up quite a bit. The feeling of a band being around my forehand disappeared very significantly for a few seconds then gradually came back. I also start shaking at times especially if i do it for a while and it feels like something is released and tension is let go. Somebody said something about how the vagus nerve activated if you do deep breathing correctly and if you aren’t breathing deeply while meditating you won’t make much progress. Realize this is kinda a ramble but just wanted to give you guys some good news. It’s good when one of us improves so let us know what helps. You can do this exercise on your back as well, i do it for 10 minutes trying to breath deeply into my belly/navel without my chest moving. I got the regimen from Meido Moore’s book The Rinzai Zen Way and it’s a really good book that might help some of y’all.

4,Mastering Brainfog is Mastering Moderation.,"I used to think my brainfog was constant. It took me several years of actually paying attention (harder than you think) to figure out when the brain fog was actually occurring. It seemed to get much worse at places like the mall, or in other high stimulus areas. It happened before parties when everyone was coming over. It happened when I drank beer, when I had a sugary drink, caffeine from coffee, when I didn't sleep enough, or when I missed a meal by an hour. So I deduced my brain fog was getting worse from chemical imbalance, and high anxiety situations. Which, if you think about it, anxiety is a chemical imbalance.


So while maybe obvious to you, it took me ten years to figure out the answer to my brain fog: keep the chemical balance in check. Everything you eat or drink is a drug. Everything you don't eat or drink is a lack of a drug. Moderation is key. I now go to the gym, eat food with no added sugar, drinks lots of water, get 8 hours of sleep, practice no-fap most of the week. **EVERYTHING is under dosing, or overdosing.**

One thing that's hard to get right is anxiety, and my biggest revelation came next. I've been taking yoga classes. I didn't know why I liked it at first, but It's taught me a lot. Yoga is suppression of fluctuations of the mind. It's focusing on the breath so your mind doesn't jump around so much. **I found that I am almost constantly living in the past, or thinking about the future.** Thinking about things I could've done better, or things I need to do later. That's a major source of anxiety in itself. My teacher reminds us throughout class to come back to our breath, and I find she's always right, I'm thinking about what groceries I should buy, or a job interview I messed up. Mastering the idea of coming back to present and focusing on your breath, not on the future, not on the past, and **not on the brain fog** is key to controlling it.

Sometimes I need to settle my brain fog fast. Go into a dark room. Suppress all sounds and other sensory inputs. Turn your phone on silent. Sit up straight and focus on your breath for ten minutes. Try it, and let me know if it helped.",bzbo7y,31.0,0.94,8.0,2019-06-11 12:10:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/bzbo7y/mastering_brainfog_is_mastering_moderation/,0.0,0.0,,

6,"Brainfog certainly teaches you life lessons, doesn't it?","Hey All!

&#x200B;

I thought i'd make a positive thread on the forum, brainfog has taken a lot from us, but it has also in a way prepared us to be immensely strong individuals when we reach the other side, you have to be extremely willing, cunning and strong to make it through brainfog and each of you should be extremely proud of yourselves! :)

&#x200B;

So, of course when we are talking about brainfog, we often get stuck on what we've lost, but let's flip that for a moment, what has brainfog taught you? Maybe.. what has it done for you? I know this sounds strange but when you really think about it, brainfog does do a lot for you too, so it isn't all bad. I mean for one, the strength you get is basically unobtainable in any other way.

&#x200B;

Personally, brainfog has given me;

* Incredible Strength
* New appreciation for life

&#x200B;

The benefits might seem few, but we must be positive at the end of the day, not falsely so, but we must accept there are good side effects of brainfog, and despite what we have lost and might lose, i garuentee you brainfog is in the process of teaching you valuable lessons are you by, and crafting you into a better you.

&#x200B;

For example, if you got here via a type of binge, surely you would learn moderation, strength, etc. You'd become more sensible with usage or just cut them out completely, its a costly lesson, but atleast we got something back, hey?

&#x200B;

I'd like to remind everybody that brainfog does and will go away, you don't just get a spell cast on you, its purely biological, and just because the science doesn't seem to all be in our favour, doesn't mean we don't exist, we know the hells of brainfog, and there is a biological cause, somewhere.

&#x200B;

I plan to make big contributions to helping everybody try things, etc. in the future, but currently my brainfog and health are too inconsistent to do such a thing, but meanwhile, just remember that theres all reasons inside of you for your health problems, and you **will find them.**

For lurkers and posters alike, we are friends, and i wish you the best of a life from now onwards, even if your not on this forum in months time because you are cured, i hope you can come out of it having learnt something, having a new appreciation for life, which many won't be able to have and enjoy in the same way.",c36f4r,27.0,1.0,6.0,2019-06-21 05:05:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/c36f4r/brainfog_certainly_teaches_you_life_lessons/,0.0,0.0,,

0,Fixed my brain fog!,"I'm just going to give my perspective on what helped my particular situation, please take what I say with a pinch of salt as I think it was a multitude of things and wasn't one product or supplement. I am still learning but can say my brain fog is pretty much gone!

**Background:** I used to be really clever and sharp back when I was  around 15 years old but gradually I developed ""Brain Fog"" without even knowing and got worse ever since. At the age of 25 I was working for a large organisation and really struggled to retain any information, make connections between ideas, had terrible anxiety and so on. So I started researching about what was going on and realized brain fog was a ""thing"". The conventional doctors could not help with my brain fog or digestion so I started learning from functional medicine doctors.

**Realizations:** I am still learning about what is going on but I've learnt there is a connection between the gut, anxiety, inflammation and brain fog. Whenever my gut and digestion are working properly then my anxiety and brain fog is under control. A lot of what I learnt was from Dr Justin Marchegiani on Youtube and I highly recommend checking out his channel.

**What I did:**

1. Fix the gut \- I did whatever I could to improve my digestion as I've had ""IBS"" for about 8+ years. As per Dr Justin I incorporated Betain HCL with every meal which had protein. This increases your stomach acid which helps digestion of protein and also helps the release of enzymes. You can also take enzyme supplements. I still continue to take Betain HCL to this day and can't live without it. I also cut out most of the grains in my diet as I felt it made my symptoms worse. Make sure you eat your meals in a relaxed state and chew thoroughly.
2. Breakfast - Dr Jordan Peterson touched on this also but you want a breakfast high in protein and fat which stabilizes your blood sugar and helps anxiety. My go to is a green smoothie which includes frozen blueberries, banana, frozen kale, 1 avacado, pea protein, hydrolyzed collagen power and half a lemon.
3. Inflammation - Dr Justin talks about this in his brain fog video but high inflammation can lead to brain fog type symptoms. Eating clean foods helped with this but I also take tumeric + black pepper supplement everyday. A recent blood test I took showed that my C Reactive Protein was low, showing that my inflammation is under control. I also cut down my alcohol binging which tends to makes my inflammation worse. 
4. Control anxiety - I used to be a really anxious person which made my digestion suck, which made my brain fog worse! The breakfast is key but I also started taking Liposomal GABA every morning to get me out of that fight or flight response. I have also been taking Ashwagandha KSM-66 supplement for the past few months.

This has just been a brain dump of my findings in the past year, hope this helps someone out there.

3,A rare but important silver lining,"I am currently suffering from a cold.  Now its not  particularly severe but bad enough to make me feel fairly under the weather.  After letting my boyfriend know through text, I got a very kind reply telling me I ought to take it easy and rest up, and that we could stay in instead of going out the next evening as planned.  

As lovely as this was, the thought of staying in for a something as trivial as a cold- a walk in the park compared to the symptoms I am used to, made me want to laugh.  At the time. I had just finished a set of tredmill sprints and was about to move on to weightlifting. Sure, I wasn't feeling great, but after almost 2 years of pushing on through extreme fatigue, debilitating brain fog and a host of other awful physical symptoms, the thought of taking time out of my routine to rest hadn't even occurred.  In this moment I realised the monumental difference in my mental and physical endurance that has occurred as a result of this exhausting battle.

4,Who else has sinus pressure along with their brain fog?,"As the title says, does anyone else get sinus pressure with their brain fog?

Personally, I feel that when my brain fog is in full flow, my sinuses seem to be inflamed at the same time. My eyes, and forehead feel heavy and stuffy which I believe adds immensely to the foggy feeling.

Now, I prefer breathing through my mouth. Breathing through my nose feels restricted, but my nose is never really blocked with mucus which must mean it is inflamed. I have been taken steroid nasal spray to try and relieve this pressure which will hopefully reduce my brain fog.

5,Searching for an answer,"Hello everyone. After lurking here for some time I've decided to make a post.

For the past few years or so I've struggled with an unidentified feeling of not being able to function properly. This issue didn't start abruptly but was gradual and has gotten progressively worse over time. Between other health and life issues I ignored this for too long and have realized it's not something that can be willed away.

The hardest part about this symptom we call brain fog is the difficulty in describing it too anyone, especially Doctors. If I didn't have this problem I probably wouldn't be able to understand it myself.
Despite that, I believe how you go talking about your symptoms can drastically change the response you get. 

My ""brain fog"" is something I experience 24/7 but can vary somewhat thought out the day/week for unknown reasons. A way to describe it would be that my cognitive ability and my senses are not working right. I get a lot of visual snow (look it up) and moving objects will drag too much, like how you wave your hand in front of some screens. Mentally, I feel very cloudy, with it being difficult to maintain a thought or even write this.
I often forget what I'm doing while I'm doing it. Even things I'm passionate about are mostly beyond me now. I don't feel like I'm at where I'm at or doing whatever I'm doing. I feel like I'm not completely awake or concious. Just very spaced out always. 

I've been checking things off that it could be and I've explored a lot of things already. For instance: sleep study, blood tests, thyroid, heart, depression, anxiety, lymes, diet, brain scan, eye tests, meditation, exercising (feel physical weak as well), chiropractor, moving, and probably more that doesn't come to mind.

I plan on seeing another chiropractor. One that specializes in the neck, like a NUCCA or something. But honestly I'm getting very tierd with my situation and hopefully figure something out soon. Sorry this is poorly written or if I wasn't clear about anything. If anyone has suggestions or can get anything useful out of my rambling in solving their own brain fog that's great.",cbflgl,21.0,1.0,15.0,2019-07-10 11:35:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/cbflgl/searching_for_an_answer/,0.0,0.0,2019.0,7.0

I’m not about dying to prove a point, and my life is now in full survival, I can hardly breathe, my head is gone, my stomach is shutting down which is affecting my ability to absorb what my body needs, my body is weak, as is indicative of my large hernia and my feelings, and so many other issues inside of me

4,"(Temporary Relief) Since taking 600 mg of magnesium JUST ONCE, I have significantly less brain fog. It’s gone down by 50% overnight. My vision is back to normal, and my memory is super sharp. I feel... Halfway normal! At least for now.","BEFORE I GET EXCITED.
It’s only been a few days,  I’m not saying this is a cure as I probably will drift in and out of the fog until the real cause is found.

But nevertheless....Magnesium has given be great relief for a few days now. Don’t know how long my good fortune will last.
Mind you, I only took it for one day, yet the benefits extend for 3 days now.

Vision back to normal. My working memory is a lot sharper I’m LOVING it. I don’t feel completely brain fogged or depersonalized, I feel.... Half normal. Even though it only eliminated 50% of the fog for a few days now and the fog is still there, it’s the difference between a rainy overcast sky, or a sky with clouds but you still see the sun here and there.

And I know we all want a little relief(even if it’s not a cure) which is why I’m posting this.

1) I took 600 mg of elemental magnesium. 400 mg from magnesium chloride and 200 mg from magnesium citrate. NOTE. When I say 600 mg, I’m talking about pure magnesium content , not 600 mg of magnesium citrate where citric acid is 500 mg of that. I spread the dosage throughout the day, and this is better for the body than a large dose all at once.
2) The best form is usually a protein chelate. Try to get Magnesium glycinate, taurinate, or citrate, malate, etc.
3) I took 600 mg of mag in one day. But that does not mean you have to. It’s a high dosage/not sustainable at that dosage daily, so it’s up to you to research or try what you want. I’m not responsible for any mistake you do(sorry guys just have to say this in case someone decides to blame me if magnesium makes them worse).",cmcz7c,26.0,1.0,24.0,2019-08-05 16:11:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/cmcz7c/temporary_relief_since_taking_600_mg_of_magnesium/,0.0,0.0,2019.0,8.0

2,Inspiration! My Brain Fog is Gone,"It didn’t happen over night.

Honestly, I remember surfing this subreddit all the time, but hardly remember what it was like to have brain fog.

I suffered for 5 years+ 

And the brain fog slowly went away as I started to cut bad shit out of my life.

I completely quit drinking (427 days sober now)
I moved from Ohio to Southern California.
I started a business (and it’s doing really well)


My advise is simple.

Step 1: Cut all the bad shit out of your life. Alcohol, weed, porn, toxic relationships, etc

Step 2: Set goals. I set a 90 day goal to lose 20 lbs. I did it! And that gave me so much confidence (limit it to 3 goals per 90 days)

Step 3: get back up after you fall. You will relapse. You will eat bad ship. You may even fuck up and go back to your ex and regret it. Just get back on the horse and correct the course.

* Sensation of fullness is head

*This  is not a concrete list of symptoms, however these symptoms are the  general concensus of many brainfoggers combined. This list will be updated to compensate the most common symptoms as time goes on.*

It is important to realise that **brainfog is a symptom** of a bigger issue. There are many issues that can cause brainfog, and  it is uncommon that another ones cause is the same as your own, although it does happen. There are resources in development to document the  variety of causes of brainfog, and there are soon to be ways included in  which to fix the variety of causes.

Because brainfog is a symptom of a bigger issue, it is important to realise that **brainfog is not permanent!**  as soon as you fix the issue causing it, you tend to see a difference  in no less than a month! However, the cause of the brainfog may mean you  need to stick to a lifestyle change to not experience this again, such  as being gluten intolorant, no more gluten, sadly.

There  is a critical shortage of world-wide coverage on brainfog, it is not  well known or well understood. This is sad, and can easily become  frustrating, however it is important not to let this discourage you. It  can be very confusing and many many other things when you are told its  all in your head, as many have. Or too just have the issue dismissed.  Fear not, you have landed yourself upon a community that thoroughly  understands the ins and outs of brainfog, the struggles, everything. For  as long as you remain, you'll never be alone in this journey. There  will be no questioning, or lack of relating to your issues.

We  hope your visit here will give you strength, a sense of community, and  more importantly, a step forward to fixing your fog. It's very important  to realise, despite how hard this is, that because of the lack of  understanding for our issues, that **recovery can start and stop, with you.**  This is why it is so important to stay strong, but it is okay to have  down-falls, we will be here to pick you up, and we hope you can do the  same for somebody else who may be in such a situation.

We  have many resources here, we have 4 years worth of posts to delve into,  a developing wiki, and an even bigger project, being driven by [u/DefunctSprout](https://www.reddit.com/u/DefunctSprout/),  which will be even more informative, organised, and will hopefully push  and make easier the recovery process and identification of brainfog  issues so that more people can be free, quicker.

I would also like to note that another mod, [u/OnionWayWay](https://www.reddit.com/u/OnionWayWay/)  also has a Discord server! He is currently the only moderator on the  Discord, however plans are in consideration to make it more active,  eventive, engaging and useful. Here is the link!  [https://discord.gg/NKRaenC](https://discord.gg/NKRaenC)

The  rules and expectations of this sub-reddit are pretty broad, our rules  are listed on the side, in which we have few, and this is to allow  flexibility. Please, respect this privilege. As long as things remain  related to Brainfog, there are few restrictions. Things that aren't  allowed (relating to what can be posted, and what will be tolorated in  general) can be found below;

**So, now that all of that information is out of the way, a warm, warm welcome to the sub-reddit!**  We'd love to hear your story, so feel free to introduce yourself, and  check out our resources! I hope you can be apart of our growing  community, and hopefully when you over-come your personal struggle, you  can become a beacon of hope for people whom still need help.",czt257,19.0,0.9,4.0,2019-09-05 00:02:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/czt257/welcome_to_rbrainfog/,0.0,0.0,2019.0,9.0

1,Sinus surgery cured my brain fog.,"I had brain fog for 5 months solid. It was constant, morning 'til night, and felt like I had taken too many Benedryl and my ""head was inflamed."" Many times I was scared I might die or had something seriously wrong with me. 

My bloodwork was all clear, but I had been experiencing many sinus infections. I had been working at a preschool and getting exposed to countless viruses, and I had a cold/sinus infection for 9 months.

On top of being sick, I had horrible brain fog...but it felt separate from my sinus issues. And when I would get some relief from sinus stuffiness, the brain fog continued unabated.

I saw an ENT and got a CT scan, which showed a lot of inflammation. I broke down in tears in his office while describing my brain fog. He felt sure it was related to the inflammation that was clearly shown on the CT scan. I scheduled the surgery for six weeks out.

Recovery was more brutal than expected: two weeks with silicone stents up my nose. My husband asked if I still felt the fog, but it was hard to identify symptoms because I was so stuffed up, inflamed, on pain meds, and miserable. It was a lost two weeks of my life. 

However, the stents came out and I dried up....and felt completely normal again. Two months have passed since the surgery and I have not had a single hour of the brain fog that was ruining my life. In retrospect, my horribly infected sinuses were clearly contributing to my brain fog, which makes sense because my brain and head felt inflamed, and there was probably pressure/inflammation coming from the sinuses to create that sensation. 

So, if you have a history of sinus issues, especially those that are resistant to antibiotics like mine were, get checked out by an ENT. Surgery is expensive and invasive, but it did help me a lot.

Good luck. Hang in there, people.",dld18p,39.0,1.0,56.0,2019-10-22 05:04:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/dld18p/sinus_surgery_cured_my_brain_fog/,0.0,0.0,2018.0,10.0
2,Broke down crying when I found this Reddit,"Hi guys,

I just wanted you all to know how insanely, insanely happy (as happy as my brainfog allows me to be) I am to have found this subreddit. I've struggled with brainfog since early 2017 - and it catapulted me into depression, anxiety and a general lack of will to live. I've tested myself for it all - and this Friday I'm going to do a sleep apnea test as a final step. I might not figure it out soon, but it helps me so much to see that it's not just me being fucking lazy or dumb, there is a roadblock and an obstacle that I - and we - are so fucking brave to climb over and try to beat every single day.

&#x200B;

I have a perfect life by all measurements - but the brainfog is keeping me from enjoying it. I've found myself in the most wonderful of surroundings with great people, but fucking down and sad because I can't enjoy it.

&#x200B;

For me the worst part is the feeling that I can't really see what is in front of me. It's like my brain is seeing, but not taking in anything - and this has caused me to completely lose interest in most things, one of the most significant of them being women - and I very rarely get interested in anyone at all, or I'll go soft when I'm with someone. I've also studied at a very high ranked university, but every day was a battle of worlds to get through - and at one point I had to research whether 'youth dementia' was a thing. In the end you start blaming yourself for it - and it was such a tremendous emotional relief to see that we're all these people out here who are capable, strong-willed and clever - but kept back by something we just need to figure out.

&#x200B;

Don't know why I wrote all this, but I hope some of you guys can relate to my symptoms, and what it feels like to be half the person you know you could be.

I have a lot of trouble having conversations with people without messing up my words or forgetting what I was going to say or what we were talking about. My friends think it's funny when I've made a completely fuckery out of a sentence but I find it so frustrating and upsetting. I mean I've always had a bit of an issue with verbal communication or forgetting what things are called in the moment (especially when tired or hurrying. Saying ""Hey pass me that thingy over there"") but it wasn't a common occurrence or nearly as severe. This is all the bloody time now. I've begun to not want to interact with other people at all because of this.",djfk4r,27.0,1.0,13.0,2019-10-18 00:41:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/djfk4r/i_feel_so_dumb_and_useless/,0.0,0.0,,

6,I don’t even feel like a person sometimes,"My mind feels perpetually empty and trying to think, as sad as it is to say, is actually painful. Before this all started, I was still shy but I could hold conversations. Now I can’t even put together a sentence to describe how my day is going or to give a summary of a 20 second news segment about bunnies. It also happens when I’m alone and I force myself to summarize something I just read. I can’t even come up with a single word. My brain just seems to default to “give up” mode every time and I feel like I’m not in control of the jumbled nonsense I end up saying, which always earn me some weird looks and nervous laughter from other people. 

Somehow, through fear of disappointing my parents and facing that fallout, I maintained a stellar GPA through high school and graduated at the top of my class, but the years since in my studies have only gotten harder while my brain fog has not gotten any better. 

Combined with anhedonia, panic disorder, social anxiety, and what I suspect is quiet BPD, I feel truly helpless, like I either have to almost kill myself with anxiety just to achieve normal things in life or deal with the consequences of failure.  

The worst of it is my inability to speak and my loss of intellectual capacity. I feel stupid and uninformed talking to others because my memory is shit and even forcing myself to learn and be interested in things is a major anxiety-inducing chore. And when I do force myself to do things that terrify me, like going to interviews or giving speeches, I never feel like the payoff is quite worth it, even in hindsight - I know it is on a rational level, but often my successes still leave me feeling empty. 

I don’t know, I feel like my sense of valuation of the world and my life is heavily messed up. If I valued my own life more, maybe it would motivate me to try harder to break out of this rut. But outside of occasional bursts of emotion, I feel apathetic about most things. I’ve never been super opinionated even before brain fog, but not being able to articulate my opinions on important issues because I’m not sure what they are (except for a few issues) just makes me feel completely inhuman. And it’s embarrassingly obvious when I’m called upon in a social setting to give my thoughts that I either don’t have any or have such troubles doing so that I should be in a therapist’s office instead.",dnxfct,24.0,0.97,8.0,2019-10-27 18:27:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/dnxfct/i_dont_even_feel_like_a_person_sometimes/,0.0,0.0,,

8,"Just finished the Stormlight Archives, never did i expect a book to portray Brain Fog so well. It resonated deeply with me and i want to share a bit of my thoughts on it. [ Minor spoilers for the Stormlight Archives]","Taravangian is a humble, kind and compassionate man. A man known for providing free access to city hospitals and visiting those on their last legs, dying on empty hospital beds. So selfless is he, that without asking he is given the reigns of the kingdom after a power vacuum caused by a devastating succession war. The people love him, yet he is known as dim and slow witted.

What makes Taravangian unique, what makes his character resonate with a sufferer of brain fog such as myself is that his own intelligence varies on a day to day basis. Certain days he wakes up, and he is the smartest man in the kingdom. Other days he is slow and sluggish, a senile old man. This curse of his could never be allowed to become public. And so each day he wakes, his most trusted advisers test him and ensure he is in the right mental state. If he scores bad, he is kept from making any political decisions for the day. 

One day 5 years ago, Taravangian had a day like no other. On that day, he woke up as perhaps the smartest man in history. During it, he managed to create a plan. One of salvation, aimed at protecting all of man kind from the dark future ahead. His plan was so great, it managed to predict geopolitical events years into the future. It was so accurate that it was prophecy like. This plan of his was called the diagram.

The diagram rules his life now. He spends much of his time struggling to understand the diagram, yet he never can. No one can.  So follow it he must, trusting his past self might be the only why for humanity to survive what is to come. Although the day he wrote the diagram was like no other, the chasm between his intellect during a good and bad day is so vast, that he can't truly even grasp his motivation on a good day, let alone the day he wrote the most important prophecy of man kind. 

I feel like those of us, who have been dealing with brain fog for years feel very much the same. I look to the distant past, those few days where the fog is mostly gone, and remind myself how freely my thoughts would flow. It is very easy to forget, and get lost in the never ending chasm of the fog. Sometimes, i forget that my baseline is not the norm. That spending so much effort to have a coherent verbal thought is not how it's meant to be. Yet fog less days are few and far in between.

The longer the time in between a fog less day, the more i start to doubt my own sanity. Maybe, i'm just not that bright. Maybe, this is who i am. Not everyone gets to be sharp, and quick witted. Some people are just mentally deficient and accepting it, is better than struggling with false dreams that keep me up at night. And then it strikes, a day of clarity. During such a day, i truly see the world in a different colour. I start to make connection in my head that i deemed impossible, recall information and work with it in a manner that i can't truly fathom or explain in my current state. 

Although a day of clarity brings much joy to my life, accompanied with it is a horrible sense of dread. As in those few moments, the realisation that i could truly accomplish all the things I've set my sight on kick in. The person who I've always wanted to be is within arms reach. So close, yet so far away. Because deep in my heart of hearts, i know what is to come the following day, maybe even the following hour. The storm will come, and the earth will shake once more. My verbal thoughts will start to disappear and so will the agency i have over my life, the dominoes begin to fall and eventually ill return to a lifeless shell yet again. Living an aimless life in a state of constant autopilot. 


I want to leave you with one positive note however. We all know that time becomes a meaningless concept in the grey cloud that consumes our life. But one day, be it in a week, a month or a year. The clouds will vanish and the sky's will clear. On that day, when i awaken once again from this slumber. I vow to write my own Diagram.

Thank you for reading, and thank you Taravangian for the inspiration.",dcbvk3,21.0,0.97,2.0,2019-10-02 15:36:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/dcbvk3/just_finished_the_stormlight_archives_never_did_i/,0.0,0.0,,

3,One of my worst nightmares came true,"I am in uni and was recently cold-called by a professor in the middle of class to answer a question. I don’t remember what the question was, but I remember thinking it was something pretty basic, and that made me panic even more.

I asked him to please repeat the question. He did. Then dead silence. I couldn’t speak for about 10 seconds, though it felt like longer. I finally choked out some semblance of “I’m sorry, I don’t know,” and he still tried to push it a little. I heard some mean-spirited chuckling/stifled laughter in the room at that point, and I guess the professor saw the look of death on my face because he just asked someone else who gave a brief and well-worded answer. 

It does not help that I’ve never spoken up in that course halfway into the term, and that it is a required advanced course for my major, which also means I’m expected to be well-versed in the basic info. To add to the fact that I feel like I chose the wrong major, brain fog makes everything 10x harder. 

I never participate 99 percent of the time, even when I’m fairly confident I know the answer because the moment I speak up, my brain forgets how to construct words, much less sentences. Yes, it’s social anxiety, but I also struggle with focus just as much while writing papers alone and trying to articulate my ideas to myself. I feel perpetually dumb and empty and dissociated, driven only by base impulses for food and sleep and low-effort entertainment.

I feel lonely with this condition. It’s so rarely shared and rarely understood, never mind the other personality disorders and mood disorders that I have. 

And of course there’s no one to blame for that. Even pre-brain-fog me would not have really understood what it’s like for someone to have such difficulty just speaking in normal everyday situations. Physically I seem to be fine when I go for checkups and blood tests, so I’m thinking the root of my brain fog is cognitive, in which case I may be even more screwed.",dr4fa8,41.0,1.0,9.0,2019-11-03 18:26:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/dr4fa8/one_of_my_worst_nightmares_came_true/,0.0,0.0,,

7,Reminder from 6 year sufferer,"So as the title says I've been struggling through the fog for about 6 years; that's 6 years of feeling intoxicated, incompetent and exhausted. I'm able to count on two hands the days where I've felt clarity and hope since the age of 15, which has led to me dropping out of university, the breakdown of personal relationships and financial hardship. I've felt suicidal and hopeless ever since the fog descended, and I've noticed a lot of you feel the same.

Recently, however, this mindset has began to shift, as for the past couple of weeks feelings of clarity have been present at an unprecedented frequency, despite no major changes being made. Although I still feel depressed and pretty fatigued, I feel hope that I (and many of you guys) will break past this symptom, whatever the cause, and feel grounded, present and alert once more.

“ask of oneself three challenging and yet powerfully liberating questions:

- What am I not saying that needs to be said?
- What am I saying (in words or deeds) that’s not being heard?
- What’s being said that I’m not hearing?”

- Cold showers

- Limited tech use
I try limit the time on my phone/laptop especially during evenings. I found this has a positive effect on the way I wake up the next day

Along the way I have been in some depressive episodes, the current one being the most severe.

My therapist finally brought up dissociation disorder. When he told me the symptoms, I recognized nearly all of them. In my case the disorder has been created by childhood trauma, a type of ptsd. I have not been aware that I had a trauma, because my brain has shut down the memories of it. 

Actually the first times I have experienced the childhood trauma events (actually I know little about my childhood) was when I tried Shrooms and acid. These gave me the clarity to look back in time and to think about it. I might use those substances in the future to tackle the cause of the disorder. (Your experience or tips are very welcome)

I don't know if I'm happy now I know the cause of my brain fog, because it takes a veryyyy long time to fix it. But on the other hand now I have a clear goal and can work towards it.

I hope my story has been helpful to anyone. Don't give up!",ea97tt,36.0,0.97,25.0,2019-12-13 20:16:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/ea97tt/i_just_found_out_my_brain_fog_is_actually_a/,0.0,0.0,2018.0,12.0
3,Do you feel incompetent at work?,"Anyone else feel like that can't perform simple tasks at work?
I feel like I go into this ""zombie mode"". I can't process things like a normal person would. I make really basic mistakes and misinterpret information given to me.

I've always known that i'm truly capable of tasks. But it's gotten to a point, where after years, I'm starting to question if I really am capable. Maybe I'm actually just permanently hindered.

I don't know.

All I know is that I have this weird brain fog at work, and it goes away when I'm back in my regular day to day life.",eatjm3,31.0,0.98,8.0,2019-12-15 03:02:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/eatjm3/do_you_feel_incompetent_at_work/,0.0,0.0,2018.0,12.0
4,I cured my brain fog!,"*this is MY story and works for me, I just want to share the info please do your own research don’t just duplicate mine*

I’ve suffered from brain fog since the 10th grade (I am now 26) I remember the exact day I got it, and I still don’t know why. The painless pressure in my head + fatigue was my first symptom.

 I recently got fed up and bought many supplements for brain support. I take a lot so I’m not sure which one is helping or if it’s the combination. I saw the results after day 2... I stopped taking them for 2 weeks just out of curiosity, and the brain fog came back. So this stuff works! *side note: I have a very mild case of narcolepsy and I haven’t had a sleep attack or experienced fatigue on these pills

Please do your OWN research, most of these supplements are for neurotransmitter support

I use 
l-arginine
Ginkgo Biloba
GABA 
Fish oil
L-theanine 
5 htp 
St Johns Wort
L-tyrosine
And of course B vitamins supplement. 

I hope this helps whoever reads!!!!! It saved my mind.",ebemdk,30.0,0.95,18.0,2019-12-16 12:37:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/ebemdk/i_cured_my_brain_fog/,0.0,0.0,2018.0,12.0
5,I’m a former genius / child prodigy and brain fog as destroyed my life.,"At the age of 14 I casually self teach myself a college text book in a few days. Today at 21 I feel barely functional. I’m currently chiropractic treatment for a long undiscovered traumatic neck injury. My physical senses I’ve gotten better since I started treatment and I’m no longer suicidal and have for the first time in my life gained a sense of smell but I’m stuffing from brain fog. My new psychiatrist wants me to show my x-rays to a neck surgeon and neurologist. I don’t know if I’m more worried if they recommend surgery or won’t. My brain fog started sometime when I was 15. I struggle with knowing my 14 year old self could run mental lapse around me.

I’m not sure what sharing any this will accomplish but I want desperately to share this with someone who might understand.

Feel free to ask any questions.
