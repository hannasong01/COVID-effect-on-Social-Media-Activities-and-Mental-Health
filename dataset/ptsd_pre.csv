0,Guys! I did it! I graduated!!,"I come here a lot to vent or ask for advice and you all are always so wonderful. <3 But today I'm here with good news!! 

I graduated college yesterday! 

I have PTSD from severe child abuse. My father, my abuser, works 5 minutes from my school and 10 minutes from the graduation location. Everyone said I'd never step foot on campus because he was so close and because it's huge. Not only did I step foot on that campus, but I GRADUATED!

One of the last things he said to me in court was that I'd never go anywhere in life because he ruined me. The judge said I was a bright little girl and I'd make an excellent attorney one day. 

Guys, I DID IT! (Kinda. I'm a paralegal! And I got my notary acceptance letter!) I don't know if law school is in my future or not, but I'm still so proud of myself.

1,Having PTSD is like being afraid of ice cream...,"I’ve been thinking of how to explain what PTSD is for me, and I thought I would share.

Having PTSD is like being afraid of ice cream. You LIKE ice cream. You WANT ice cream. Most of the time, when you think of ice cream, you have positive happy feelings. You look forward to it.

But because of PTSD, sometimes, you irrationally fear ice cream. Sometimes, when someone offers you ice cream, you become SO AFRAID and you don’t know why. So afraid that you can’t think. Sometimes ice cream makes you want to throw up. You want run away at the sight of ice cream. You want to CRY because that’s how scared you are. Your brain goes, what am I doing?! I like ice cream. I’ve been craving ice cream. And yet here I am, running out of the door when I see ice cream. Shoving it back in your face. Getting angry at you, because I’m convinced this ice cream is poisoned, even without proof, because it was once before. Blacking out if I try to eat it. Going completely numb.

Even when you’re experiencing it, it doesn’t make sense. It makes no more sense than fearing ice cream. It’s like there’s you, then there’s the ice cream, then there’s a third version of you which is PTSD, standing in your way. And it is a bummer, because you’re over here having panic attacks while other people are happily enjoying their ice cream. That is what PTSD is to me - liking ice cream, but also fearing ice cream, and never knowing which way you will feel.",8gse7u,111.0,0.97,26.0,2018-05-03 18:02:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/8gse7u/having_ptsd_is_like_being_afraid_of_ice_cream/,0.0,0.0,2018.0,5.0
0,It annoys me when trauma survivors say their trauma made them a better and stronger person,"I've never said this to anyone, especially not trauma survivors, but I dislike the belief that trauma molds people into better, stronger people. I think anyone who experiences trauma has a right to feel stronger, more empathetic, braver, etc. if that is what they feel from their unique experience. But it's okay to not feel that way. It's okay to feel angry, sad, scared, hurt, and any negative feeling that comes from experiencing a traumatic event.

I am a survivor of childhood sexual assault and I f-ing refuse to attribute my positive qualities and achievements to those traumas. Before the traumas I was happy, confident, full of life, trusting. The sexual assaults literally altered my body and brain development. My childhood was hell. It was my inherent strength that got me through, not the events themselves. 

Maybe for some people, their trauma helped them see that they were strong and brave all along, but I already knew that about myself BEFORE it happened. I actually lost confidence in myself for not being able to stop the abuse when I tried. 

I'm not some happy, smiling, cheerleader who says, ""Rape made me better"" because it didn't. Maybe for some people, it does, but not for me.

**ETA: I know why some survivors say their trauma helped them grow to be stronger, more thoughtful, and better people BECAUSE they made themselves learn to cope in healthy and beneficial ways which makes them feel stronger as people. There's nothing wrong with that and that is what I agree with. That is an empowering thing to know YOU got YOU through. Not the adversity, but what you did to face it and overcome it. But some people don't attribute their strengths and positive experiences from the trauma(s) itself and that's okay. Everyone's feelings are valid, but we do not all feel the same and should not be lumped together. Please don't invalidate commenters in this thread for discussing their feelings because it's not easy to talk about this.

1,Today I stand up to my CEO,"Update: Thank you SO MUCH for the insight, kindness, and support. I read a lot of encouraging comments right before I went in and again after I came out. I practiced what i was going to say over and over again that morning.  I didn't cry or lose my place and I stuck to facts only. One person in upper management in particular really had my back. After the meeting I cried a bunch and then went up and down several flights of stairs over and over until I was ready to go back to work.  I really do appreciate all of the kind words. I'll keep reading them to get myself through the next few weeks as well.

Original:


About 6 weeks ago my boss made a joke about sexual abuse of children. I didn't feel like I could do anything about it because he is the CEO. Shortly after that he made a joke about women in the workplace speaking up about sexual harassment. 

I wound up in partial hospitalization and diagnosed with PTSD related to several traumas including sexual assault I experienced as a child.

I asked for a meeting with all of upper management so that I can start back up at work with clear boundaries for what I won't accept anymore.

This will be a good thing in the end, but right now I feel like I'm going to throw up. Meeting is in 3 hours. Send good vibes please?",97rewh,119.0,1.0,17.0,2018-08-16 11:19:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/97rewh/today_i_stand_up_to_my_ceo/,0.0,0.0,2018.0,8.0
0,"I hate when reddit discuses rape, sexual assault, and the trauma involved.","Just saw a post on /r/confessions about a man who is sexually coercing his wife by manipulating her into thinking that the terms of her consent are being met. Of course, barely anyone points out that he is sexually assaulting her and when I do, random reddit idiots respond telling me that he isn’t sexually coercing her and that I don’t understand what sexual coercion is (as if two years of my life weren’t made a complete and utter nightmare by my own experience with coercion and a police report for sexual assault was never filed.)

Our society’s views on dating, relationships, and sexual deviance (*especially heterosexual men’s views—don’t argue with me*) are so backwards and blatantly incorrect that I feel like it’s safer to be brutal and ruthless with my boundaries (and risk hurting a love intere’s feelings) or be alone completely. It’s just so deeply disturbing  how misogynistic, self-centered, and oblivious men are in their relationships with women. I wish I could feel romantic attraction to women because life would be so much easier and safer.

1,"Dear Brain, you repressed that shit for a reason. Don’t go randomly remembering it, especially without warning.","I saw a post on one of the advice subs (idr which one). Basically this guy was having sex with his girlfriend and she asked him if he wanted to watch her have sex with his friends. 

My brain went... “Hey. That sounds familiar. Give me a second while I dig into that.”

Then I suddenly remembered... My extremely abusive, hyper-sexual ex... I think it was the same week, maybe even the same session (it’s all a blur) where he took the condom off and proceeded to fuck me despite me screaming no and pushing on him and crying...

Before all that he had asked me something about him watching me have sex with guy friends. He brought up a specific friend, Daniel. I told him I was uncomfortable with it and I didn’t want to do it or think about it. 

Later, he proceeded to describe it in detail while we were having sex once. Just thrusting that image of my platonic friend fucking me while he watched. 

I wasn’t able to look Daniel in the eyes for weeks. I got paranoid of every moment around him. 

Eventually we got back to normal. We’re not even that close anymore. But I hate what my ex did to me. And that friendship. 

You know.... I saw on social media that that ex had wrecked his car. I saw the pictures before I read the text and I found myself... Disappointed when they said he had walked away without a scratch. 

Fuck him. Fucking die for all the shit you did to me. For the bruises and the pain and the coercion again and again. For the gaslighting and the suicide threats and the rape. For taking pictures of me without my consent. For fucking existing.

1,I miss my intelligence,"Since my major trauma 7 years ago (along with other traumas) which have caused me to spend most of my days in a dissociative fog, I feel like the act of thinking is so difficult. I was labeled a 'gifted' child, and I remember my mind being quick. But now, my cognitive processes feel so scrambled up and sluggish. I get so confused sometimes I have trouble filling out simple forms or answering questions on the phone.

2,"Does anyone else find being in nature profoundly calming, healing and refreshing?","I've been curious if anyone else has experienced this, and I would like to get feedback from not just nature lovers but those who aren't so bothered about nature either. So also If you aren't really a nature lover, if you have been in places like forests/woodlands or very wild/natural picturesque areas, have you nevertheless found any kind of healing or extreme calm simply by being in that environment? I tend to feel this strongly myself, though I know that I am a nature lover, so I'm curious if its just simply connected with my love of nature or whether it could be a universally healing thing independent of being a nature lover or not.

I suppose that because I have a lot of social anxiety, the remote nature of a lot of wild/nature environments give me a strong sense of peace and calm eventhough it is still ""outside"" and ""public"", and its very refreshing, like a reset button in some ways. I'm definitely not a ""new age"" type hippy person but I find it profoundly uplifting and calming. I know that some people have investigated what some have termed forest therapy or forest bathing. It would be very interesting if one day someone does more in depth and comprehensive research and study into this.

0,Got emasculated for having PTSD today,"I was on a date today with a girl I’ve been seeing for a while, and I finally opened up to her about my PTSD, and she said she didn’t knew I served in the military. I didn’t. I told her that. She immediately became more cold and even called me a pussy and sick because I’m ridiculing others that actually have PTSD and have been traumatized by blaming all my petty problems to fake PTSD. She emasculates me for saying that I have PTSD when I don’t, because evidently I’m not strong or “man” enough to deal with problems normally. Sorry my parents fucking beat me for the first 18 years of my life. Now she’s left me and I’m just typing this out of anger and frustration because I’m sitting here not able to sleep because I know I’ll get more night terrors if I do let myself sleep and I just can’t handle them anymore.

2,My mentally handicapped brother ate his guinea pig alive,"So, some of you may have seen my post from /r/advice end up on the front page. I never really took PTSD seriously before, other than obvious cases like war vets coming home, parents with dead kids, etc.   


Boy, was I ignorant. Some quick background if you didn't see my original post in /r/advice:  

I am the 30 year old brother of a 22 year old man who has the functionality/mental capacity of an 8 year old. He has seizure disorder, autism, and a plethora of other issues due to oxygen deprivation at birth. This past sunday I witnessed him eat part of his pet guinea pig alive. I ended up calling 911, and he is currently in 72 hour observation at a mental health facility.    


At first I thought it was awful but something I could easily get past. I've seen some messed up stuff online, but this was a new horror.   
 

Things are happening to me now that I don't really understand and I'm concerned it's stress related or PTSD. I woke up last night with cold sweats and was having extremely vivid nightmares. I had what a think was a panic attack this morning after looking at facebook and seeing my parents house. Just the sight of the house itself and it was like I was reliving the whole ordeal. I took work off for next couple days while I recuperate but I'm not sure what to think. Is it too soon for PTSD? Am I just being dramatic?

1,Living with PTSD is incredibly exhausting,"I wonder if people without PTSD have any idea of just how exhausting it can be to live with it.

It tires me out on a daily basis. My triggers are everywhere, especially when I leave my place and venture out in public. Being constantly set off by these things is exhausting. My heart races, my muscles tense, I start to growl... I'm basically thrown into fight-or-flight mode all the time. And don't get me started on the constant anxiety that forces me to be on hyper alert for my triggers.

Even short trips to the convenience store a couple of blocks away can run me ragged by the time I get back. It drains me so fast. I keep thinking that I should just lock myself away in my room, hidden from the outside world, but that isn't realistic, especially since I started working again in December.

I have to face it, so I do. It doesn't make it any easier. In fact, its twisting me in a way. I have very angry and violent thoughts about hurting others as a result, to add to the exhaustion. Dealing with those intrusive thoughts is exhausting in itself. Then there's the Worm, but that's a topic for a different subreddit.

3,I miss my abuser so much. It makes me feel gross.,"I was trafficked as a child/young adult. Obviously, there were many people involved in this situation, but there was one man that was mostly in charge. I got news a couple of weeks ago that he died in prison. Everyone in my life feels like I should be happy or relieved about that, but I'm not happy at all. It's really.... painful. I feel like I'm in mourning over his death. 

I keep having dreams about all of the ""nice"" things he did for me. Handing me a glass of water. Allowing me to sit on the couch after a particularly violent encounter. Giving me a blanket to sleep with when I was really sick. I can't stop. I literally catch my brain thinking that this dude loved me and I'm really sad that I'll never be able to see him again. Which is probably the most fucked up thing I've ever thought in my life. Seriously. This man killed my daughter and essentially ruined my life, but my brain is somehow trying to convince me that he loved me???? It makes me nauseous that I could even think that, but somehow it creeps back in. 

I've told a couple people in my life about these feelings and everyone is like ""dude, that's fucked up. How??"". I don't know how?!? I'm crazy. I don't know. I guess i just wanted to share with some people who might understand. I am hoping these weird feelings pass quickly and never come back. Jesus.

4,I disclosed,"

Wednesday evening I had a guy I’ve been seeing the last month or so come over to my place. We’d slept together before, and I’d already felt relatively safe, but this time I got triggered. I don’t know why, maybe it was the stress, but when he bit my leg (something I usually enjoy) I triggered, and I started flailing and kicking, then rolled over on my side and covered my face. He was gentle and checked on me and I apologized, and he pulled me in to cuddle. After I calmed down a bit, I said something about how we should talk about it, he said that we didn’t have to. 

I don’t disclose. I was in denial of my rapes and abuse for years, and when it all came out I told my boyfriend at the time. We’d been together for years, we lived together, I completely believed that he was going to be supportive. Instead he verbally abused me for hours, told me I was a slut and a liar and other horrible things. I have struggled with disclosure ever since, and have missed out on potential relationships because my fear of disclosing makes me disconnected and withdrawn. Disclosure is a huge barrier for me. 

But I disclosed. I had to work myself up to it, and he was patient. He already knew I had ptsd, so I said “my ptsd comes from sexual assault and domestic violence.” I talked a little about it and explained my reaction. I had to work myself up to it, but I did it. I was still very activated so I put on music and told him we should talk about other things to distract me, so he let me show him all my gemstones I recently got. He literally listened to me talk about rocks. I managed to pull myself back and finish having sex with him, and he was gentle even though I knew it wasn’t his preference. I kept apologizing to him about everything that happened and he told me it was okay, and to stop apologizing. 

This is a huge event for me. Disclosure to a sexual partner has never been successful for me. Most of the time it doesn’t happen. Potential relationships have been impaired by my avoidance. Disclosure itself carries trauma for me. I’ve been talking in therapy about how to disclose for years. So this is a big deal for me. And I’m proud of me. I hope that this means I’ll start being able to have this discussion with more serious romantic partners and I’ll stop ruining relationships.

I was punished when he abused me, and now I'm still being punished in my adult life, because of what he did to me. He fundamentally changed me, and I can't get my self back. Some people don't know me anymore or wonder why I can't do things like I used to, because that old person before my abuse and before I realized it was abuse is loooooong gone.

0,Do people assume you’re “dumb” or “slow” because of trauma symptoms?,"
Do people assume you’re “dumb” or “slow” because of trauma symptoms?

I’ve been called slow and dumb my whole life. A lot of people think I am ditzy and an airhead. Often I’m not aware what is going on in the present moment because I am in my head (anxiety, dissociation, ruminating thoughts). I often will have slow responses to people because I am emotionally dysregulated, I was distracting myself and/or hypervigilant as I try to read the person/situation (I try to figure out if I am safe and can trust them). When I get dysregulated, I often freeze and forget what I am doing. I know my cPTSD symptoms are a big reason I appear “slow” because when I take a mood stabler, a lot of those symptoms go away. I also I wonder if having cPTSD for so long had changed my brain so I am slower and have a slower processing speed.
It bothers me a lot when I get patronized and treated like I’m slow/dumb. Sometimes people think I am lying when I say I went to graduate school. Also, sometimes I attract manipulative, insecure and sexist men who like to feel like they are superior and try to infantilize me because they think I’m
Slow and inferior.

1,I’m so sick of people telling me...,"That I should talk to my parents. That it’s “so sad” I cut them out of my life. It’s not sad, it’s the best god damn thing I’ve ever done for my mental health. They continue to deny my trauma, gaslight me and protect my abuser. They punished my daughter and refused to see her because they were mad at me, and that was the wake up I needed to their bull.

My entire childhood was spent being gaslighted about my feelings, being told no, being brow beaten Into who they thought I should be while refusing to do anything to help me. When I told them what he did to me as a child, they didn’t care. They’d rather bury their heads in the sand and expect me to “let it go” because it’s easier for them. Not once did they ever give a single shit what I was going through. They paraded me to the family when I was put in a psych ward to say “see look how loving we are” but not even a week prior my mom told me “you didn’t really try to kill your self or you’d be dead”.

I tried everything I could to fix things with them, gave them every opportunity to be a part of my journey and they didn’t want to. That’s not on me. I will not be sorry for refusing to poison my peace with people who don’t care what I’m going through. 

Sorry to rant but I needed to vent. People just have no clue what it’s like to live in fear of my trauma. To live in endless loops of it, to hear my abusers voice at night when my husband talks or see his face when my husband touches me.

3,"After a long time of feeling frustrated by lack of progress in therapy, I finally told my therapist something that turned it all around","Disclaimer: I began therapy less than a year ago and have only ever been to one therapist, so my experience is very limited. I have no idea if this will help others or apply to anyone else's situation, but since reading it would have helped me, I thought I'd give it a shot.

For the longest time I felt like my therapist basically chatted with me, gave me compliments (telling me how strong I was, etc) and just told me what I wanted to hear. This made me angry and so many times I would leave our sessions thinking ""I don't need compliments, I need *help!*"" I could tell I wasn't getting anywhere, but everyone I talked to who had been to therapy kept telling me that it takes time and I just needed to be patient.

I got so frustrated that I was one session away from switching to someone else. I worked up my courage a little bit, went into the session, and said ""I'm frustrated with my lack of progress. I feel like you are treating me carefully, like I am fragile and ready to break at a moment's notice. Telling me I'm strong makes me feel good temporarily, but then I leave and I'm still in this deep black hole. I need you to push me out of my comfort zone. I need to know, is there a way I can make faster progress?""

Stupidly, I was afraid this would somehow offend her. Instead, without batting an eye, she simply said ""Yes. We can delve deeper into your trauma and start getting into the heavy stuff. That is the fastest way for you to make progress. I wasn't sure if you were ready."" For the rest of that session and for subsequent sessions, she completely changed her whole demeanor/approach. And let me tell you, it was (and continues to be) so, so shitty. It's been hard. But I'm in a better place, I can feel the sadness slowly lifting, and I actually feel like I'm making progress now. 


I'm so glad I didn't switch therapists before saying that. It almost didn't even occur to me as a thing I should say. To everyone out there, whether you're in the same boat or not, I wish you good luck <3

4,PTSD IS REAL.,"Most everyone here already knows this. This is to the people who dis-believe in it and I hope to reach the ignorant or misinformed.

The insomnia is real. No one chooses to stay up all night and go to bed at 4AM, be tired as hell in the morning ,and feel like ran over garbage.

The triggers are real. Certain movies, noises and visuals can cause anger, fear, anxiety, depression, and sadness to the point of crying (even for non-cryers). This is due to the feeling of re-living the event(s).

The trust issues and suspicions about people are real and don't take it personally. Ever hear ""I like to keep most things to my self""? That's an auto-response, nothing personal.

The nightmares are real. Sometimes nightmares of re-living the event and then waking up feeling a chaos of bad emotions; often ruining your entire day/days.

Anxiety is real and is often because of [insert event(s)]. Creating it for people who didn't have it prior.

Avoiding talking about it and avoiding things that remind you of it doesn't make the problem invalid, and aren't just ""faking it"". It's a logical, natural coping mechanism to avoid thinking about it.

An aversion to being physically touched is real. Ever hear ""don't touch me"", or the person is uncomfortable with being touched? Well the [insert event] is *likely* related to that. Again, don't take it personally.


Point being: no one fakes anything I listed above for the sake of feeling pity or ""just playing the victim"". It's a real problem just like anything else and it doesn't *only* apply to veterans and law enforcement.

I was confused and trapped in the house with him for a year. He was really dangerous and I didn't understand and I was isolated from my family. This group told me that it was starting to sound really fishy and warned me of red flags. You guys were right and I'm getting a divorce. I'm reconnected with my birth family and I'm going to be safe and recover. Thank you guys so much.

We discussed for 30 minutes everything we wanted to do and I told him everything I could think of that made me uncomfortable and I had the best sex of my life. It's a small success to some but being able to be intimate with my partner without fear of my ptsd and how it may seem to him is a huge step for me and I am happy to be able to have sex for the first time without any kind of trigger or fear. Normally I dont tell him during sex if I'm triggered but he can tell and he stops anyways. Today we had sex after 3 years of dating that was just us. No ptsd. Just us and I feel like I made so much progress.

I quit drinking in December once I was able to get a glimpse of how unmanageable my life had become. 
I had no idea how much of the emotions and life i was running away from and numbing. 6 months later and the suffering is so much more manageable and tolerable, but the suffering of getting clean was a big part of life and all emotions coming back full definition. 

I had so many walls and blockers up from the numbing of the alcohol that the day would not pass by normally, I felt stuck in the day. My subconscious just keeps going it seems, just trying to process all the new.

But I have broke the habit. I can deal with my new emotions again, I just feel a little raw and feel like I'm carrying my hurt around, but with time and venting it will all get better.

I'm now on my way of getting my life out of apathy, neglect and numbness and under achieving into a clean slate with all the room and will and tools to achieve.

Unlike my last therapist, she didn’t give me a weird look or try to question it. She just simply told me to lay back and I was able to open up a little bit more once I laid down and looked at the ceiling. One day at a time.

5,Anyone else tone down your femininity/sexuality to prevent sexual abuse?,"Anyone else tone down your femininity/sexuality to prevent sexual abuse?

I stopped dressing feminine, wore baggy clothes, channeled my masculine energy to scare/intimidate men so I don’t get sexual attention. Yeah, I did this. And also when I was covertly sexually abused by my dad, instead of protecting me, my mom got jealous and stopped taking me to get my hair done and wouldn’t let me get my nails done even though she had originally promised. I looked unkempt growing up.

And now at 27 that I know what happened to me and have come to reality with the abuse I went through... I have no sex drive and have no interest in flirting and emitting sexual energy towards other men. Also, when I have flirted in the past, I realize I behaved like a little girl. So now I’m grossed out that men were attracted to me when I acted like a little girl, does that mean they have pedophile tendencies?

Also, I’m really intimidated by dominating and masculine men but also attracted. Like I only can be around men who exhibit feminine/passive energy right now and I get scared around dominating men who can make me submissive and thus controlled. Controlling my environment helps me feel in control and feel calmer due to my abuse history. Weird part is my abuser (dad) was actually passive and had submissive energy but was still abusive, creepy and manipulated by playing the victim. You would think I would be more scared around those types of men But I still find myself feeling safer around these kind of men over dominant because I can intimidate and scare them away by channeling masculine energy.

I am grossed out by men and don’t trust them—too many creeps out there who seem nice but then betray you. If I had a daughter I’d be so protective. It’s a scary world out there.

6,Does anyone else have a bit of a staring problem (hypervigilance) that was developed due to PTSD when around people/crowds?,"Like it almost feels you are the predator in a way since you keep your eyes on people and their movements? My traumatic experiences have caused me to become very hyper aware and vigilant. My eyes follow and observe people like a hawk  so I stay ""safe"" and avoid such people who I feel will hurt me again(which in my case translates to everyone). But the thing is I believe everyone is a threat, so my eyes follow and watch everybody through my peripheral vision beyond my control. As if my subconscious is taking over and shutting down what I can control in the present time. The thing is having this issue is nearly destroying my life. I will literally stare everybody down until they are out of my eyesight lol, I have caused hostility, frustration, and creeped out people, but its like my animal brain doesnt care or listen to me or their responses. Its incredibly difficult if not impossible to be in a classroom (it making me really want to drop out) because I am more focused on the people around me than the teacher/board. People notice this and I make them incredibly nervous because of it. I cant speak or relax in group setting since my eyes will dart around scanning the environment, as if I am still in danger. I am only completely at peace  when I am completely alone

8,It’s been over year since my parent’s murder suicide.,"To give some context, the event happened on May 20, 2018. We had just moved into a nice apartment after living in Extended Stays for the past couple of years. I got my own bedroom and the complex had a small pool I could swim at during the summer, which was really exciting for me since I was so used to sleeping on air mattresses.

It was around 10:00am. My mom went to pick up a dog that my dad was supposedly going to give me as a gift. Me and my stepdad expected the trade would take only a few minutes, as they were meeting at a gas station across the street from the complex building. An hour later, she didn’t show up. My stepdad tried to call her over and over again, but she wouldn’t pick up. I didn’t worry that much as I thought that the trade was taking longer than expected.

A little later, we hear a knock on our door. It was the police who told us that my dad shot my mom, than shot himself. Everyone was in absolute shock when they heard the news. They were crying and screaming with grief while I just stood there trying to comfort anyone I could. It didn’t set in with me that this was actually happening.

A lot happened during that year. I’m leaving out a lot of details, but I ended up being put in a mental ward for a week after threatening to commit suicide. After the event, I bottled up so much emotions that it got to the point where I just snapped. In that instance, I wanted to kill myself. I wanted to kill other people. I wanted everything to just stop existing for as long as I wanted it to.

Needless to say, I didn’t feel so good for the next few months. I still struggle with the grief but I try to manage it as best I can. It’s the middle of the night as I’m writing this. It keeps on playing in the back of my mind so I can’t fall asleep. I felt like I needed to get this out there so I would stop destroying myself over something that wasn’t my fault.

I was 14 when it happened. I’m 15 now. I can’t see myself the way my peers do anymore. I feel like my childhood was taken away from me.

TL:DR The murder suicide fucked me up big time, and I’m trying to get over it the best I can. Sorry for the long post.

One thing I started to do is like, focus on something OTHER than the event but it’s still in that flashback time. 

So for example, my flashbacks are related to a sexual assault. Rather than focusing on the action itself, I try to remember what the stairs looked like. We were in a basement when it happened, so I try to picture the stairs and then maybe the walls. 

Another time, I tried to remember what was on the tv, or make up something to be on the tv.

18,"DAE have episodes when they blank out/emotionally flatline? I call these ""grey outs"".","I've been getting these for a while. Now almost every day I have issues with dissociation type episodes and I'm not sure what's causing them. Mindfulness sometimes helps break me out of it.

I have periods when my mind completely blanks out. This is on a spectrum. I've had many times when I just freeze and become an empty statue for some unknown amount of time. I can't respond to people. I don't know what's going on. I'm not even thinking anything. Just a statue.

Less severe episodes will have my emotions blank out and it's like I feel nothing at all. I become very stupid and make a lot of idiotic mistakes or break things accidentally. It's really frustrating and this lesser severe type episode happens almost daily. It's really ruining my life... :/

I've had difficulty finding counselors who are willing to treat my PTSD. Dx 2010. A lot of the counselors I've seen said I'm not ready to go over my various traumas, just day-to-day stuff.

I've been on lots of meds, but none seem to do much. Some made me worse actually. I'm on lamotrigine (for possible bipolar, they're not sure I have it), and olanzapine for sleep/nightmares. Anxiety meds don't do anything. :/ (at least not clonopin, vistaril, gabapentin).

2,The person who sexually abused me was denied parole with no chance for another hearing!,"The hearing was today. I didn't go but the victims services advocate I've been talking to emailed me about it. I didn't end up writing an impact statement. I tried but it was too triggering so I let the advocate know that and she asked for my permission to tell the parole board that I was too triggered to write an impact statement because that alone gives an idea of the impact. So I told her to tell them and that I also thought they should know that I've been diagnosed with PTSD and I'm in therapy and on antidepressants and anxiety medication and medical marijuana for it.
The email said: ""The reasons for the denial are: nature and circumstances of the offense, injury and impact to the victim’s and inadequate institutional program participation.""
I replied to ask her when he'd be up for parole again and she said: ""He won’t be.  The board denied him with no chance for a re-hear.  There are other means of release thru the department of corrections, please be sure to keep your registration current so that if he applies you will be notified.""
I'm so relieved. 
And he didn't even get to leave prison to go to the courthouse. They did a video conference from the prison.  And no one showed up in support of him or even to do an impact statement. No one he knew cares about him anymore. There's no one who wants him released. He has nothing and no one and I'm glad.
Even if he does get out, there's at least 7 men in my family who own guns and want to shoot him and he's well aware of that so he'd probably stay away.

7,Do any of you feel as though you attract abusive personalities or that your PTSD makes you more prone to tolerating others that you wouldn't otherwise?,"***I am NOT saying that the victim is to blame - nobody EVER deserves abuse or anything less than the best in any relationship dynamic. I do not think that people with PTSD are merely crying wolf over and over; I want to clarify that, so that people don't get the wrong idea. Below is merely my experience, and I know a few friends with PTSD/histories of trauma have related to my experiences & interpretations.*** 

&#x200B;

I've realized that whether it be friends, romantic partners, even roommates - I tend to find myself with people whom are narcissistic & don't want to recover or take accountability for themselves, people whom take advantage of me, or whom are abusive. I know that I don't deserve or want this treatment, but I know that my PTSD often takes over, and doubts the ""red flags"" I feel other people would react to, or I allow many more boundary violations than I should. Essentially, I feel as though the ways in which my PTSD has manifested causes me to allow really abusive, manipulative, etc., people into my life whom I wouldn't otherwise give the time of day.

&#x200B;

Does anybody else experience this? It's really started to fuck with my head, and makes me wonder if my roommate's claims (most recent occurrence of this) are true. Especially since he's started to be all buddy buddy with my other roommate, since I put boundaries in place and I stopped tolerating his BS.

13,"""The Body Keeps the Score"" My new favorite book","2.5 years ago, I had a near death experience that landed me in a medically induced coma for 9 days. I thought 10 years had gone by when I woke up and I lost 30 pounds of muscle. That experiences also unlocked a lot of repressed memories for me. I was sleeping at most 4 hours a night, barely eating and I couldn't stand the company of others. I was a horrible wreck and barely able to function.

1.5 years after that experience, I was able to start therapy. I also went back to physical therapy and both of these therapists kept recommending a book to me about the impact PTSD has on us. It was written by a psychologist who has been treating trauma since the early 1970s, starting with Vietnam War veterans, moving on to specializing in treating people who have been physically or sexually abused as children.

It took me a long time to finally get this book. I was convinced the connection I had with my body was permanently altered because of this overwhelming experience. I could barely feel my left side, my throat was totally numb from the tube they had down my throat even 2 years later. The sheets of my bed made my skin crawl, reminding me of struggling weakly to move around in the hospital bed. I was too traumatized to believe relief was possible.

Then I started reading this book. Maybe this wont be everyone, but reading this book makes me think that what is happening to me is actually understandable, its manageable, its treatable and its **not permanent**. I can feel more now, things are getting better, its easier for me to de-escalate the tension and stress I feel on a daily basis.

21,An annoying thing about PTSD and recovery...,"Recovering from PTSD is a pain in the ass. And like a basket of enraged 400 lb primates throwing shit everywhere there’s some elements about it I was surprised to discover.

One of them is how annoyed you’ll feel dealing with bullshit that wasn’t yours to begin with.

You’re just a normal person bebopping through life like a bunny in a green field of fresh grasses when along comes some flaming fuckhead shitshow and rains on your parade.

Wonderful. Just fucking wonder-fucking-ful. You didn’t ask for this and now you got all this extra work *on top* of just trying to live your life. Fuck.

So now you’re juggling weapons grade resentment and the justified anger while working really hard to fake your happiness and not get fired from your job because bills don’t give a shit about your mental health.

Ya feel?

Look. It’s normal that you feel that way. It’s cool. You’re not the only angry bastard pissed off at how unfair it all is.

So give voice to that shit in a safe place: your journal, here, your therapist, that life sized rubber duck you bought because the inanimate object will listen to you and the other rubber thing is too fuckin’ weird and you just want to get through life without getting triggered. Scream at the goddamn duck.

Be angry. Connect with your feels. Give a middle finger to toxic masculinity and pour your rage into lifting weights or whatever helps you burn off all that hypergolic fuel so you can function and get one small step closer to that normal life you know you deserve.

Give voice to the injustice. Your anger and rage is justified. It’s ok. Connecting to your emotions is work.

Anyway, I’ve had anxiety and depression my whole life (as far back as I can remember), but this past year it has been particularly bad. Inpatient stays, outpatient, therapy, etc. A few weeks ago, I started having flashbacks, and my mind just can’t stop thinking of the things that happened. 

I’ve been angry. At first, it was towards my mom, but lately I just feel angry at myself. I think things like, “did this even happen? why am I making such a big deal out of this? Do I just want attention? Do I just want to feel bad for myself? I didn’t know exactly what was causing my anxiety and depression, so have I just resorted to blaming it on my childhood?

4,I called out my abuser in his establishment’s TripAdvisor comments for what he did to me and all the girls in the group I was traveling with. I feel both empowered and very alone.,"Ten years ago I traveled abroad with a group for a “gap year” in South America. We had a weird and terrible experience when we went to a spa retreat owned by an ex-pat American man. 7 of the other girls were molested during a “spiritual healing” ceremony without anyone saying a word, they all were 18 and that’s the only reason I can think they didn’t speak up. I went last and fought the abuser and got out of there, then went to my group leader with it and as I told her about it the rest of the group chimed in saying “me too me too!” Against our wishes the group leader told the abuser the reason why we decided to leave early, and the abuser came to my room at night to try to tell me it was all innocent. I was still just a kid but I had to be the face of the group. Then our own group’s leader talked to me about it later in the trip and said it was all a misunderstanding, that things were different back in the hippy days and she was raised with that kind of thing and he didn’t mean anything by it. I went home from the trip afraid of being touched at all by my significant other and it took months for me to recover enough to just be touched. 

Flash forward to today. I watched a documentary about a man who abused foster kids, and at the end the story said the abuser had moved to a tiny island outside Guam where there was little oversight. I remembered my experience and I realized it’s possible he’s still out there doing exactly the same thing. Sure enough, his TripAdvisor is full of recent reviews - he’s definitely still in business. And as I searched I found out a woman went to his establishment and was raped by him, two months after our group’s visit. She traveled back to his country with her husband to sue him and talk to the media. Reading this really validated my experience because I had been wavering in my mind about the experience all these years. But this was a totally separate incident right at the same time we were there. 

So, I wrote about the experience in detail in their TripAdvisor comments. I explained exactly what happened in that public forum. I felt I needed to take some sort of action and I think this was an impactful thing to do. I’m worried TripAdvisor might take the comment down. I got a message back from his wife on my review and it essentially said I must be mistaken. It brings me joy to think he and his wife had to revisit this subject yet again, and that I might save someone else from going through what I did. 

It feels good to have done it but it hurts me that I can’t share it with anyone. I feel empowered but also alone.

Edit: Thank you for the support. I have actually been feeling guilty for possibly hurting this guy’s family’s livelihood and started questioning myself, so your support is really appreciated.

10,Anyone else get PTSD from a parent with BPD?,"I took my comment from another thread to start this discussion:

My mom had BPD and abandoned me when I was 3, thankfully my dad was amazing and held onto me. Whenever i would see her (starting again at age 6) her symptoms would have her be extremely volatile. She wouldn't give me affection unless it was a show for someone else, called me her niece in public for a while, drank all the time, and made her adult problems mine. I had to escort her out of family parties at 10 when she would get drunk and belligerent. When I was 13 or so I remember she spit on me. When I was 16 she chased me into a bathroom and told be she was going to beat my ass because I started calling my step mom ""mom"" too. I never called her by her name to her face, she just didnt want to share. Following 16, she started with a lot of false suicide attempts for attention, which I always treated seriously. Our relationship was so weird. First she didnt want me, then we were familiar strangers, acquaintances, distant cousins, and then friends.

Until her last suicide attempt, that accidentally went through. The table broke under her. The police I called called me to come down.  It was the day before her dads 70th birthday, and I had to tell him to his face that his daughter was never coming back. 

I did her makeup for her viewing. It's the least I could do. I loved her so much, in the most damaging way to myself. I put up with everything because it was obvious her BPD made her suffer and everyone except her family left her. I couldnt stop grasping for the love she wasnt able to give. 

Now I struggle to get and keep jobs. That was only the worst thing that happened to me. I had a marriage with a man that was practically the Male version of her, and I was raped after I left him...I got catfished...please dont call me stupid I was vulnerable. It took 9 months to meet. 


Now the obvious triggers get to me, cluttered houses, crowds, loud places, and the month of July is awful for me.

Mom had BPD, was abusive, killed herself and involved me. Now the obvious triggers get to me, cluttered houses, crowds, loud places, and the month of July is awful for me.

11,I fell apart at work and now my coworkers are gossiping about me.,"I’m so overwhelmed. Last week, the flashbacks were so bad the night before my shift (I’m a server) that I was awake all night, and I wasn’t able to call in. Needless to say, I was not in a good head space. Of course, that one day in particular was absolutely CRAZY at the restaurant, and I was struggling to keep up. 

My coworker asked me why I was so overwhelmed, and said that I should have been handling this better. So I, not wanting to divulge my whole mental health history, just joked that I must have partied too hard last night. I thought I made it clear that I was kidding, but I guess not, because she started spreading it around that I wasn’t able to perform my job and that I was falling apart. When my supervisor came to talk to me, I broke down crying and explained what happened. Now the coworker is accusing me of lying, and I heard her and some other girls talking about how I’m incompetent at my job. 

I can’t do this anymore. I understand making a hangover joke was probably in poor taste, but considering we’re all college kids, I thought it would go better than explaining the real reason. Just feel super demoralized and I hate myself for it.

12,"Those of you with sexual trauma, do you struggle with experiencing sexual attraction?","For a bit of context: I've experienced probable CSA along with repeated sexual trauma as an adult. I'm having a really hard time recently realising that it's so difficult for me to a) experience real sexual attraction at all, b) when I do experience it, experience it consistently, and c) decipher whether or not I'm attracted to someone.

For so much of my life I've found myself projecting my general feelings of sexual desire onto someone I wasn't actually attracted to, almost always someone who's expressed attraction to me - I think very often I misread the positive feelings of validation I get from knowing someone is into me as feelings of attraction on my part.

I'll think I'm attracted to someone until I actually do anything physical with them, and then I realise I'm just not feeling it at all. But even then I'll experience the physical sensations of arousal, which is always confusing and distressing for me - it feels like it's happening against my will and makes me second-guess myself and wonder if actually I *am* attracted to the person, even though there are alarm bells in my head telling me, 'no! This isn't good for you!'

There's been one person in my life - an ex - who I'm sure I experienced real attraction towards, but even then it was inconsistent. We had a romantic/sexual relationship, and sometimes I experienced attraction so strongly and it felt so good, right, instinctive and natural (though not necessarily without PTS symptoms during sex), and other times it was just like the attraction vanished (I found this tended to be when I felt less emotionally connected to my ex and/or when my mental health was poorer).

I suppose I just want to know if anyone here has similar struggles with sexual attraction? Does any of this sound familiar to you? And does anyone have any insight or any advice?

I'm struggling so much with this at the moment and am so fearful that I'll never be able to experience normal/healthy attraction, it would just help to get a little bit more of an understanding of my feelings.",cm91po,123.0,0.98,76.0,2019-08-05 10:00:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/cm91po/those_of_you_with_sexual_trauma_do_you_struggle/,0.0,0.0,2019.0,8.0
13,Does anyone get triggered by things that have nothing to do with your trauma? (TW),"I was diagnosed with PTSD 13 years ago. Since then I have figured out all of my triggers and have done my best to work through them. However, I have one trigger that is super random and has nothing to do with what caused my trauma! 

Here is some background-

When I was 5 I was sexually assaulted

When I was 10 I witnessed my dad try and murder my mom. He was on some sort of drugged and just flipped out on her. I'm not going to go into detail because it still makes me shake but it was horrifying.

When I was 14 I was raped.

All of my triggers from these are triggers you could imagine. I have one trigger though that is super random?! Whenever I am in a car and it starts to storm or if i am in a car with a driver who drives somewhat fast I immediately get triggered and break down into an episode. I have no idea why this happens? This trigger is bigger than all of my other ones too?

16,Anyone else get triggered and feel unsafe around unorganized/spontaneous people?,"Anyone else get triggered and feel unsafe around unorganized/spontaneous people?

I am actually technically an ENFP so at my core, I can be pretty spontaneous, unpredictable, and disorganized myself. However, my manager part (Internal Family Systems Part) is very organized, impatient, efficient, logical and perfectionistic. My manager comes out frequently when I need to protect myself and take control of myself and surroundings. At this time in my life, I notice I feel triggered and unsafe around people and especially those who are supposed to take care of me when they are disorganized and unpredictable. I need to know they have my back and can catch me if I fall. I crave calm, logical, organized, and predictable people. I cannot stand when I am around people who are indecisive and make decisions in a flash based on their feelings. I notice I feel a lot of anxiety in relationships with people like this as it triggers my insecure attachment. 

I have learned that people with a traumatic background often benefit from structure and stability to assist in regulating emotions. Recently, I have had some bad experiences with my surgeon and therapist that makes me distrust their expertise. They both are laid back, unorganized and forgetful. When I notice these traits, my manager comes out and takes the role of being the organized person. I feel stressed and hypervigilant doing this as it is not even who I truly am at my best as an ENFP. I feel annoyed and impatient around them as they appear lazy and passive. I feel like I do not trust them to take care of me due to their qualities such as not calling me when they said they would. I know this is definitely related to my trauma background where my abusers were often unpredictable and you never knew what their next move would be so you had to be on edge and hypervigilant. I wonder if I should switch therapists because when I take on the manager role, it gets in the way of me doing EMDR because my exile has a hard time coming out when my manager is so present. 

I know no one is perfect and they have traits that very logical people lack such as gentleness and warmth. But I really think I thrive when people can balance me out and I feel safer when my doctors are more logical and organized. I also know once I heal more from my trauma,  I will be able to feel less triggered and unsafe around people with these qualities.

I was so loud and confident and wasn’t scared of anything or anyone for that matter. I walked with a purpose and a sense of happiness every single day. I loved waking up in the morning and I loved going to sleep knowing the next day I would be able to enjoy life again. I was artistic and loved photography it was my passion and pure bliss to me. I was very social and enjoyed traveling and going out. I always felt things with such deep emotion wether it was good or bad and I truly feel like that is why I used to enjoy life so much. My siblings loved being around me and I enjoyed their company just as much. Are favorite thing was to go to the beach and get pizza afterward. I would find the beauty in the tiniest things that normally people would pay attention to. I would laugh at everything especially with my friends. They were the best friends you could ever ask for and I miss them dearly. I miss always being known as the “hard working” person in my friend group. I miss sitting outside in the middle of the night on the porch with my dog feeling the breeze and having this content feeling within myself knowing that whatever happens in the future that I would get through it. 

My trauma has taken that ability to feel at peace in my soul and heart. 

I hope one day my siblings won’t look at me in such confusion as to why I am not the same anymore. I hope one day I will be able to finish an oil painting without dissociating for long periods of time and not being able to concentrate. I hope one day I am able to hang out with people without freaking out internally because they want to give me a hug. I hope one day I can sit on the porch again and feel that internal peace I once felt before.

I also hate being told that I have to be strong, even though I know it’s relatively decent “advice”. No shit, I have to be strong. Otherwise I wouldn’t even be here right now. 

Someone said to me that they went through a comparable minor incident (breakup of a <2 year relationship), and got through it by praying to God, saying it liberated him and made him feel so content with life. And while yes, he is valid to feel upset about it, I don’t think it’s appropriate to bring that up to compare to my bus crash and my mental recovery with it. They and their family also went on to tell me that my medication was all gateway bullshit that I need to get off of and being the passive dipshit I am, I agreed with them and went along with all of it. 

Not to mention, when I told them I have PTSD, they went on to ask about my symptoms and even asked “oh, what are your visions?” “what are your nightmares?” “what do you see at night?” and a TON of follow-up questions that forced me to go into detail that I didn’t want to.

11,whenever i am in a public i always think i see the person who caused the trauma but its not them,Whenever i go out and walk past someone not even similar in appearance my mind will ask is it them and then panic will arise and even though it isn't them my brain will play tricks on me asking over and over again.

14,Traumatic birthing experience,"Okay. So I have no idea where to start with this. I guess I should start with my pregnancy. I got pregnant last year, and me and my husband were ecstatic. But I had a very difficult pregnancy. I had pelvic pain that started around 8 weeks pregnant and continued up until I got induced. I got diagnosed with gestational diabetes, had to change my entire diet and then I was put on 9 units of insulin a day. And because of that, at 32 weeks pregnant, I had to go to the doctor and me and my daughter had to be monitored once a week. Then when I hit 36 weeks, I had to go 2x a week. And then I was induced at 39 weeks pregnant. When they were monitoring my blood pressure the day of my induction, they saw that it was high. They thought maybe it was nerves or something. So they tested my urine for protein, and it turns out I also had preeclampsia. And because of this, I had to be out on magnesium, which made my entire body hot and uncomfortable. I was already hooked up to so many things in my IV, the list just kept growing. They started the induction by using a foley balloon, wasn’t comfortable, but it was fine. Then when it fell out, I was dilated to 4 cm. Then they gave me a pill called cytotec to soften my cervix. Still wasn’t dilating much. Then they started me on pitocin. They told me that the magnesium and the pitocin would work against each other, and we were in for a long ride. I got some IV pain meds at some point. I still wasn’t dilating, and it had been about 12 hours in. I’m only at a 6. Doctor came in, and they had to turn my daughters head in my uterus by hand because she was facing up and she needed to be facing down. This was super painful. (I can’t remember if I had gotten an epidural yet or not) but they think they got it. And then I started dilating more and more over the course of what seemed like forever. It was over 48 hours from the start that they told me that I was at a 9. And my epidural would move to one side when I laid on my right side. So I would feel all of my contractions on my left side. And then when I laid on my left side, it fixed itself. So eventually, I started pushing at the 56 hour mark. My epidural wore off and I could feel almost everything. I pushed her out for the next 2 hours. I had to get a tiny episiotomy. And when she came out, everyone sighed a sigh of relief because it was over. But little did we know, it wasn’t over. They laid her on my chest, and the doctors were trying to get the placenta out. They took my daughter to the warmer, and my husband followed. They started to massage my uterus, but it hurt. Really really bad. It hurt worse than pushing my baby out. I asked the doctor “Why are you doing it that hard?!” 
She looked at me and said “Trust me, you want me to be doing this.”
 My mom is standing next to me looking worried as hell, which doesn’t help the fact that I’m freaking out. I then hear one of the doctors tell the other one something about me needing blood. I start freaking out, so I try to call my husband over, but I’m to weak and he can’t hear me. My father in law gets his attention, and he comes over to me. I tell him that I need blood, and he’s freaking out. 

All of a sudden, I start to get really really sleepy. I ask my husband if I can go to sleep, the nurse said yes, and my mom said no. I tried to stay awake, my husband was trying to ask me questions to keep me awake. But I passed out. Well more like blacked out because my husband says my eyes were still open. He told me I threw up multiple times (I only remember 1 time). He told me that when he would try to talk to me, I would just stare at him with this blank look on my face and in my eyes. Like I wasn’t really there. There are a few things that I remember during my black out. I remember trying to answer people when they would talk to me. It felt like I was screaming, but nothing was coming out of my mouth. I remember seeing this new person in the room that wasn’t there before. Turns out he was like the head doctor or some shit. Then I saw that doctor doing an ultrasound because they put a balloon in my uterus to stop the bleeding and then I went back under. And then I started to come to when they hooked up the blood bag to my IV. I can’t remember when, but I’m pretty sure they gave me another epidural after I gave birth. They usually take out the catheter, but they left mine in. I remember being in the most immense amount of pain I’ve ever been in. My mom had to help me shower because I could barely move. 

I know there are a lot of things that I’m leaving out, but I can’t really remember all of it. 

But because of all this, I feel so messed up. Every time I watch a show or a movie where someone is giving birth, I cry. Every single time. And it freaks me out because I can talk about what happened to me, and not cry or have flashbacks (most of the time). But when I see a labor and delivery room on TV, I get scared and I cry. My friend gave birth 2 months after me, and I was gonna go visit her, but I got scared of going back to the hospital. Every time I have my period, the blood scares me and I think something is wrong with me again. I was afraid to go home after being in the hospital because I thought I was gonna die. I’m scared to get pregnant again. 

I feel like I can’t talk about this with anyone because they’ll get annoyed and think I only want to talk about myself. I’m going to therapy, but I’m not sure if it’s working yet. 

I also just lost almost all of my friends because I just had a very bad anxiety episode, and I actually let people see what I was going through. And they all bailed. So I’m afraid to open up to anyone. My husband is deployed now. So it’s just me and my daughter most of the time.

15,You are a warrior,"So today I was at an extreme low again.the whole week got worse every day.

But when I was near giving up, I remembered what my ex told me some years ago.

I was struggling with psychosis and ptsd for around 2 years back then. I felt so weak for not overcoming my demons. I dated this incredible girl, battling with similar issues, so we shared our experiences a lot.

Then one day, she looked me dead serious in the eye and said ""you're a true warrior. You're the strongest person I've ever met.""

This was the most empowering thing anyone ever said to me. I wasn't weak, I was strong for still fighting and battling my demons, I will not give up. I AM a warrior.

17,I finished therapy today [SUCCESS POST],"I finished my sessions with my therapist today because I don't feel like I need to go anymore. I've finally gotten to a point now where I realized that I can handle things that are thrown at me, that my emotions are real, and that even though I have PTSD it doesn't define the person that I am.

In spite of what happened to me, I've been able to move forward. I am strong, and resilient, and capable. I'm lucky to be alive. I've been able to take care of myself and build up my own stability.

The dissociations have lessened. I've let go of all the anger and pain that I held onto. While letting go has been terrifying, holding on was infinitely more damaging. I'm facing my problems head on, instead of avoiding them. I understand my emotions, even the hard ones and that they will pass. In a very real way, I am good enough and deserve love and kindness, especially from myself.

It's taken me a lot of work to get to this point. But I want you all to know it's doable. I love you all and hope that things get brighter for you, because they've gotten brighter for me. There's a life that is waiting for me to build it, so I'm going to go and get to work :)",d340zf,109.0,1.0,13.0,2019-09-12 06:46:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/d340zf/i_finished_therapy_today_success_post/,0.0,0.0,2019.0,9.0
18,Less Talked About Symptom,Been doing lots of research to try to understand my diagnosis more and stumbled across a variety of academic journals that explained the prevalence and correlation of gastrointestinal issues and childhood sexual abuse. It’s not talked about much (because talking about bowel movements is not exactly the most fun thing to bring up in conversation) but it’s actually super common to develop chronic constipation/diarrhea/IBS that are not caused by any medical issue (i.e. no tumors or other medical cause). Just thought I’d mention it in here bc I’ve struggled with gastrointestinal issues since childhood and had no idea it was a symptom of PTSD.,d1sam3,106.0,1.0,31.0,2019-09-09 15:19:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/d1sam3/less_talked_about_symptom/,0.0,0.0,2019.0,9.0
0,As a veteran,"As a veteran, I just want to say that even if you do didn't serve, I know your PTSD is real.

Unfortunately, it's much easier to get taken seriously if you are a Veteran. The VA is very aware of the issue and has plenty of resources. I thank God that I found this path to help me with my mental health struggles.

Is anybody else like this?? I think I do it because I don’t want to make a big deal about shit, or maybe I’m scared if I were more expressive then people might not take me seriously or something (unfounded, my friends are very empathetic) and then I would feel worse.

Then, spending the evening beating yourself up for missing yet another event, ruminating on what they're doing, what they're talking about and the memories they're making without you. Knowing it's just a matter of time till everyone finally stops inviting you to things.

Then of course walking home leaves you even more freaked because your PTSD makes you jump at every loud noise out there and its fireworks season.

I wasted all those years, still being miserable. I finally fired him and tapered off all my meds. I felt free, like I broke up with a controlling boyfriend. I knew I needed to work on the core of why I'm so miserable (lots of trauma) so I scheduled an appointment with a well regarded trauma therapist. 

She spent the whole appointment covering herself. She said I was ""passively suicidal"" (I said I have no intention of hurting myself again but see no meaning in life). She said I needed to be ""stabilized."" She sort of threatened she might need to commit me (which was a very traumatic experience for me). And said she'd need to discuss my history with my old Psychiatrist and she probably wouldn't be able to work with me unless I was at least on anti-depressants again. She forced me to sign the release form to get on the books for another appointment.

I left feeling really pissed off. Drove home, wrote her an e-mail explaining what a disappointment it was, revoked her rights to discuss anything with my old Psychiatrist, and cancelled my next appointment.

I'm just venting. All I wanted was someone who could to talk with me and help me that way.

1,I hate it when people use the word “triggered” to mean “upset”.,"It’s been common for a few years now for people to use the word “triggered” online when someone gets upset at something that was posted/said.

It bothers me because I feel it minimizes actual “triggers”.  When I’m triggered, my body almost goes into shock. I can’t breathe, my chest hurts, I get dizzy, etc.  

Someone getting angry at someone with a MAGA hat isn’t triggered. They are angry. 

I wouldn’t wish PTSD on anyone, but I wish more people understood the gravity of an actual trigger for those of us with PTSD.

EDITED FOR CLARITY : I am referencing when someone says that another person is “triggered” because they got upset or angry. (I’m my experience only online).

Example: 

Person A: There will never be equality because men are simply superior to women.

Person B: What the fuck is your problem, are you that stupid?  Go back into your hole, incel.

15,My dad is using my dead grandfather to guilt me into being polite to my violently sexually abusive brother over Christmas.,"My dad called me the other day to tell me some news, my molester brother was coming to Christmas with his partner and my Dad was wondering if I would be able to handle it ‘without making a scene’. ‘Everyone will be there including (sisters boyfriend)’. ‘It would mean a lot to mom to have all of her children under one roof.’ He continued, \*\*’before grandpa died he said, “all I want is peace in the family”, and that’s what I want.\*\*

My brother used violence to coerce me to commit sexual acts on him from the time i was 5-14 and he was 11-20. When I told my school guidance councillor she was mandated to report it and an investigation was initiated. On the morning of my first interview with the police my dad took me to breakfast at my favour restaurant in our small town, where he said, “you can either put your brother in jail, or you can keep the family together.” I lied to the police, told them I didn’t want to talk about it. The investigation went away. My parents never punished Nick, when the investigation was over they let him pick any city in the US and they would help him move there. He picked NYC. That was 11 years ago.

Ive kept my silence to keep the family together. My parents keep reminding me in our bi/trimonthly family fights that ‘there was nothing we could do.’ and \*\*‘there will be no more family if you keep up with this.’\*\*

My brother is always playing the saint and they just fawn over how success and accomplished he is. He’s seen as the darling helper who could do no wrong.

Whenever I try to talk to my family about what he did they tell me, ‘Tell your therapist that, not us.’

In my Mom and I’s most recent fights, she let out a tirade of ‘why didn’t you tell me it was happening? why didn’t you tell me one time?’ And then followed that up with, ‘When I was a little girl I prayed to God that I would have kids, but now after all of this I wish I Never was a Mom.’

I have been trying to go NC with my brother but my family doesn’t seem to respect that. I often get texts from him in the family group text saying overly positive shit like nothings up. He’s coming to Christmas, and my parents wanted me to go on a trip with everyone else including him and his girlfriend where I would be expected to ‘Not make a scene.’

I need some sort of grounding because I’ve been keeping quiet with this hell of family and rape for 21 years, first so my brother wouldent get in trouble, and secondly so my parents wouldent look bad to their family and friends.

The biggest hypocrisy of this is that I was sexually abused as a child by another perpetrator. A older man who abused me for 2 years concurrently with the time I was being abused at home. I told my mom what had happened, he then was charged and convicted and sentenced to jail. I had my parents full support then. I told my parents about this man abusing me in particular first so they would know how to handle my brother. Turns out they didn’t. I am still glad I told them in that order, because if I had told them about my brother and then the older man they would have covered up both, and I likely would have killed myself from the stress that I otherwise barely survived.

You’re not even that attractive.”","Any other sexual abuse survivors constantly fear being sexualized then shame yourself thinking, “Who do you think you are? You’re not even that attractive.”

I am frequently fearful of being sexualized or liked by any one into women (male or female). I’ve been sexually harassed and abused throughout my life and I run away from people who start liking me or sexualize me. I just don’t believe there are men (or women into women) who are attracted to me that won’t sexualize me. I mean my own dad had a crush on me and sexualized me (covert child sexual abuse). I mean we are all sexual beings, is it even possible not to sexualize someone you’re attracted to? 

I now have a gay female therapist who I connect with so well but I have this fear of being sexualized. Sometimes I think I end up manifesting my fears because I focus so much energy Onto it due to my PTSD. I feel guilty for feeling this way about her because I don’t want to offend or hurt her especially because she is coming from an oppressed group. But there have been times where I’ve caught her looking at my legs and I felt she was attracted to them.

When I start thinking of this: what if they become attracted to me or sexualize me.. then I shame myself like, “who do you think you are? You’re not even they attractive. You’re so cocky to think people are gonna like you.” I now realize that my dad said the same thing to me when I confronted him. He said, “you’re not even beautiful.. I wouldn’t look at you down the street.. I’m sick Of your sick fantasies..” Then I’m like, “maybe I just want the attention.. maybe I want them to be attracted to me.” Which confuses me because yes, everyone wants to be attractive and have attention, but not unwanted sexualization or attention.

0,I just found out my father is a narcissistic pedophile.,"Welp. I went to family therapy to try to work out all the demons caused by my parents for covering up my brothers repeated violent sexual assault of me when i was a child from the ages of 5-14. Our family had always unusual dynamics, that much was clear, a genre of abuse could be spotted with some time spent around my parents. And not the masks they put on for the guests. Their true, screaming “YOU BRING ME NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS, YOURE DESTROYING THE FAMILY, I WISH I NEVER HAD KIDS, I WISH I WAS DEAD.” selves.

We went to therapy and I had suspected the truth but I could not believe it until I had confirmation. My brothers abuse has been hid from everyone in his life including his wife. To ask an oblique question I asked my mom, “What would you do if you found out Dad was a pedohpile?” My question was to her but my eyes were on him. 

The shock.

My heart sank.

I gave my brother an out not an excuse to explain the chain of abuse. 

“Did dad sexually assault you?” Crawled out of me. 

“Yes.”

It was the weakest, most pathetic thing I had ever seen. But it was the truth. I had worn down their defences. I am going no contact with two people now. My mom is a victim of abuse herself but grew up in the 50’s and also had her story brushed aside. That set an example for her.

Our massive kitchen was covered in blood and she rushed him to the hospital. I didn't want my brother to wake up and see it so I cleaned it up. I was covered in blood. I hid the clothes, showered and waited. 
She came home and spent the next few hours telling me I would have to raise my brother because she was going to jail for murder. They lied to the police and made me lie to everyone in the family. I found out years later that they were aloud to tell people about it but me being a stupid kid never did. 
I have other mental health issues and this time of year brings it all back. The nightmares start in September when the Christmas crap starts appearing. I wish I could hide from the whole season. I don't know why I'm venting hear I just feel like shit! 
This year I was diagnosed with bpd, bi polar and ptsd. Christmas in that house is going to be horrible.",eb57vl,131.0,0.98,16.0,2019-12-15 21:44:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/eb57vl/i_hate_christmas/,0.0,0.0,,
12,How a PTSD attack works,"This is an educational post for those that think anxiety and trauma is cute and romanticize it. Read with care. 
TW: MENTIONS OF TRAUMA AND ABUSE

I’ve been sexually assaulted and psychologically abused by my parents. I’m triggered by sexual abuse (or mentions of it), mentions of trauma, people raising their voices at me, when people pretend to throw things at me or harm me, and loud noises (such as doors slamming, crowds, screaming and yelling). 

When I have an attack I hide myself in a ball and I cry with my hands in my ears to protect myself from the noise. If someone tries to touch me during an attack I scream and I harm people unintentionally. I shake, I go pale, my heart races, my memories go back, the flashbacks go even stronger, my paranoia goes insane, and I can’t move at all. 

It’s not cool. I’m not “cute UwU so anxious”. My social interactions are affected by this. I’m scared to get out of my house alone. I’m extremely paranoid and I always walk around with a weapon or something to defend myself. My life is hard. Don’t make it seem cute. I suffer.",egqmr5,129.0,0.98,21.0,2019-12-28 13:16:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/egqmr5/how_a_ptsd_attack_works/,0.0,0.0,,

14,Trump Jr’s Book Name!!!???,"[This](https://www.amazon.com/Triggered-Left-Thrives-Wants-Silence/dp/154608603X) just adds to the misuse of the word and blatant disregard that it minimizes what “triggered” means for people with PTSD. 

I’m honestly appalled. And if I were to say anything about it other than a PTSD sub, people would literally respond with “TrIGgErEd!!”

When did people become so unaware or literally just don’t care about others?",edwor2,122.0,0.92,30.0,2019-12-21 22:55:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/edwor2/trump_jrs_book_name/,0.0,0.0,,
15,"How should I proceed with this? Therapist said she doesn’t think I have PTSD, even though I am professionally diagnosed.","I was diagnosed with PTSD a few months ago by a licensed psychologist. I had to get a 2 hour psychological assessment in order for me to get disability accommodations at my university. It was a surprise, but made sense. I never bothered to look at the PTSD symptoms. I always thought I had extreme anxiety mixed with paranoia. 

I have been seeing my therapist for around 5 months now and to say she knows me is a lie. I have not even told her half of the stuff I’ve been through. Part of that is because I think I’m repressing some trauma, but some of it is vague enough to be remembered. 

Anyways, I told her about it and she doubted it and made this confused face. She even said everyone has trauma and basically made me feel invalidated? She even looked up the symptoms on her phone to “rediagnose me”. I really like her as an *eating disorder* therapist, she has helped me very much with my anorexia, but I dunno this made me feel very invalidated and shitty. 

What should I do about it? Does she have a right to doubt it?

Edit: thank you guys so much. I’ve been reading through all the comments and it really means so much to me that you all are supportive. I also appreciate you guys telling me some of your personal experiences.
