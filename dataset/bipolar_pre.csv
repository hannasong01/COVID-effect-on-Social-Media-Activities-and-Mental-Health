4,I get anxiety from posting/commenting on Reddit.,"This sounds so silly, but can anyone relate? I want to contribute to conversations/post things but I worry about downvotes. How STUPID is that? It shouldn‚Äôt matter. But here I am, worrying that this post will embarrass me. And if I do post or comment, I seriously worry about it and if I look stupid. Like I‚Äôm a complete stranger to everyone anyway. Please tell me I‚Äôm not a total freak. The only time I can comfortably post is if I‚Äôm drunk and that results in me usually deleting them. And I shouldn‚Äôt drink anyway. I just wanted to get that off my chest.

EDIT: I should probably add that I‚Äôve been drinking and that‚Äôs why I had the courage to post this because I‚Äôm a fucking coward.

9,I have anxiety and I'm terrified of confrontation so I create arguments in my head where I can say what I really feel.

Every time I get even into the smallest of debates, I'll *always* feel like the bad guy, even if I didn't cause it or even if I'm right. I hate making people upset so I'd rather admit I'm wrong (even if I'm not) or apologise just so it pacifies the other person. I always visualise fake or past arguments in my head where I say what I actually wanted to say and it makes me feel angry but it's also empowering because I'm saying what's on my mind without the consequences of saying it for real.

11,Who else has anxiety about not doing enough with their life?,"To give a brief backstory, I graduated college in Spring 2017 and was still working as a barista at Starbucks. About two months after graduation I started to really feel the effects of my anxiety. I was panicking that I didn‚Äôt already have a better job and that I was gonna lose my apartment because I couldn‚Äôt pay bills. After relentlessly searching until February 2018, I found a job as a sales rep at a cell phone store. Since February, I‚Äôve been doing great! I‚Äôll be making about $40k a year and after five years of struggling with bills, I can comfortably afford my apartment!

Now, since about April, I‚Äôve been having anxiety, again, about me feeling like I‚Äôm not doing enough. I‚Äôve been relaxing a lot, going out to places with friends (because now I can afford it,) and playing a lot of video games(it‚Äôs always been a hobby.)  But I‚Äôm feeling pressure to go back and get a masters in the hopes of finding a better job and really going for something that I actually dreamed of doing. I just can‚Äôt find the will to break away from this relaxed mood the change in pay has given me. Every time I try to give up playing video games and going out with people, in hopes of working towards something, I go right back into this comfortable routine. 

Does anyone else feel this way/get anxiety about this? If so...does it go on forever? Will there ever be a time that I feel fully, 100% relaxed and comfortable with how I‚Äôm surviving and doing things that make me happy?",8z20x2,1093,1.0,84,2018-07-15 14:20:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/8z20x2/who_else_has_anxiety_about_not_doing_enough_with/,False,False,2018.0,7.0
12,Guys‚Äîfor the first time in my life I stopped a panic attack before it started.,"I felt my panic attack coming on while on my way to a talk at a recent conference I attended. It always starts with vertigo for me, and quickly leads into feelings of fear, claustrophobia, and the inability to catch my breath. Usually, the second I feel that dizziness hit I know there‚Äôs no stopping the panic attack that follows it. I hole up in the nearest bathroom stall and resign myself to riding it out, a process that can take hours and often results in DAYS of constant vertigo afterwards.

I felt it coming on as I was headed to the talk, but it was a talk I was really interested in so I was like ‚Äúoh no you don‚Äôt!‚Äù I focused my mind on some mindfulness techniques i learned in therapy‚Äînamely, the technique of observing my surroundings closely and mentally taking note of them (there is a red backpack in the corner, the man next to me is wearing black shoes, one of his shoelaces is untied, the room smells a little bit like sweat, etc) and GUESS WHAT. For the first time EVER, without medication, I got the panic attack under control. And I was able to enjoy the talk and get a lot out of it!

I‚Äôm so proud of myself, you guys. I had to share because I want you all to know that even if you‚Äôve been struggling for years, there ARE mental techniques that can help keep panic attacks from hitting. We can do this! We don‚Äôt have to be anxiety‚Äôs bitch! And that‚Äôs the best feeling in the entire world.",8xlqik,942,1.0,71,2018-07-10 05:00:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/8xlqik/guysfor_the_first_time_in_my_life_i_stopped_a/,False,False,2018.0,7.0
