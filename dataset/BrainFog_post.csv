0,Brain fog - 8 years - homeless now,"This has destroyed my life.  I am so crippled I can’t work, read, or do basic things in life.  I have recently become homeless.  Family is no help.  Former NASA engineer.  I can’t understand what is going on around me.  I feel like a zombie.

Does anyone have any clues, tips, possible diagnosis?  My intellect is orders of magnitude lower than it was.  My life and mind has been destroyed.  I cannot think to save my life.

My brain fog started after exposure to black mold.  Not sure if this a cause or just coincidence.  Any help on what this shit is would be greatly appreciated.  I’m not sure how much longer I’ve got.   Currently eating out of the trash to survive.  I fought with everything I had and now I’m where I knew I’d end up: in the fucking gutter.

Is there a commonality to the brainfog we all have or is it more individualized?  If I had the brain power to figure this out I would, but it is impossible in this state.

I should also mention that food seems to trigger it.  If I fast for a good 12 hours it all seems to go away.",f9tlsm,57,0.98,61,2020-02-26 13:58:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/f9tlsm/brain_fog_8_years_homeless_now/,False,False,2020,2
1,Had the best day in a decade today,"My head was clear, my eyes worked together and there was no head pressure. 

Remarkably, this was after a terrible night’s sleep. My brain is weird. 

I hope to feel more of these days soon. 

I am just really grateful for today and wanted to tell someone.",fb8jmg,49,1.0,14,2020-02-29 06:24:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/fb8jmg/had_the_best_day_in_a_decade_today/,False,False,2020,2
2,Who Else Suffers From Head Pressure and Out of Focus Eyes,"I’ve noticed a lot of people with brain fog complain about these same issues. A feeling of pressure in the forehead, behind the eyes. Eyes feel tired and heavy, tend to lose focus all the time. Colors seem dim. 
What do you think is the cause of this? For me, I tend to have neck pain that correlates with these symptoms, so I suspect that’s to blame.",fdhzmf,40,1.0,33,2020-03-04 19:10:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/fdhzmf/who_else_suffers_from_head_pressure_and_out_of/,False,False,2020,3
3,Holy shit.,"I’ve been having TERRIBLE brain fog for the last 4 years. Today I have finally pieced EVERYTHING together. 

Please be mindful that this may not be YOUR case, but it is most definitely mine. 

Every morning I wake up and I have coffee. I love coffee. I make it at home and can’t function without it at work! At home I have this wonderful machine that I’m sure many of you have heard about, the Keurig. At work we also have the same contraption. I noticed I’ve been having some terrible stomach issues for the last month as I noticed my coffee intake increased a bit. As soon as I had coffee I would notice some gastro issues, but never made any sort of connection. Along the gastro issues I noticed I would break out occasionally. I read somewhere that these machines are absolute shit. No matter how much you clean them, there are too many hoses internally, and the chance of mold and toxic bacteria is high. What did I do? I opened my machine at home. Low and behold there was some nasty bacteria in this machine. Honestly I’m absolutely terrified at this point. I don’t know if I can reverse the damage that I’ve done, and now I plan on going to my primary this week. 

I’ll keep you guys posted, but I think all of my fog COULD definitely be from here, as there’s probably a massive amount of nasty bacteria in my system. 

Wish me luck, if you have any sort of questions or suggestions to start getting better please let me know!",fg8lm3,32,0.94,16,2020-03-10 04:56:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/fg8lm3/holy_shit/,False,False,2020,3
4,Vitamine Deficiency - Found my Cure!,"I'll start off by saying that for the past two to three weeks I've been feeling like shit. I was rather apathetic and indifferent to everything, usually very fatigued and tired, as well as being in a constant agonizing state of severe fogginess. I've had my first such episode in the fall of last year which really made me worried about the symptoms suddenly returning, especially as it made studying for university close to impossible. Not only that, but any type of organized, planned and effortful behaviour such as going to the gym, cooking, or socializing seemed to be out of reach for me. I just stayed in bed and binge-watched series, played some games or did other stuff that didn't require much of my cognition.

Finally deciding that enough was enough, I called my GP roughly one week ago. I elaborated on what I was experiencing and was subsequently sent to the local laboratory for testing some blood samples. I was suspecting that it could have been something with my medication (Finasteride for androgenetic hair loss) or my thyroid, especially considering that my mother had problems with hers for her entire life.

I got my results back last Tuesday and was pleasantly surprised. As it turns out, my thyroid wasn't the culprit, but rather a strong Vitamine D deficiency (I was way below the minimum recommended threshold). Ever since then, I've been supplementing Vitamine D and while I don't feel the greatest I've ever been, I'm already better and steadily improving. Which is great, as it allows me to be productive and live life like a normal person again.

I know that this is likely something most of you have taken into account, but if you haven't done so already and are dealing with symptoms of brain fog, do get a proper blood test done. The vicious thing about this cluster of symptoms is that it can be caused by a variety of diseases and triggers which necessitates careful investigation and assessment.

Apart from that, I wish all of you the best in overcoming your struggles. It fucking sucks to experience brain fog even for a short duration, so I understand the states of frustration, anxiety and hopelessness it can produce. Furthermore, I'd like to thank the community for being a hub for collecting information and raising awareness for the various triggers this disease can have.",fi4buy,23,0.91,13,2020-03-13 18:31:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/fi4buy/vitamine_deficiency_found_my_cure/,False,False,2020,3
5,Does anyone feel their IQ is much more than what it seems,"For those who experience clear episodes every now and then, you're certainly grateful for these moments because you get to be yourself and everything suddenly makes much more sense. 
I, for one, when I retrieve my mental clarity I start reading wikipedia articles and pile my brain with useful stuff, it's crazy how quick I become, I feel like a kid learning something new because in my normal state I don't feel any urge or desire to capitalize on it because my brain can't seem to, so I reduce myself to binge watching mindless shows and movies.
I honestly feel like there's nothing that could bring my brain to work at full capacity, there's always this damn mush over it.
For everyone, I seem like a crazy person when I try to explain to them that I'm in no control of myself, that some stupid ass entity is taking over my thinking, that my brain is on auto pilot.
At the end, life goes on, you do what you can make of it.

6,"Brainfog General Information Thread - List of causes, advice, etc.","# Notes & Stuff

**Quick note:** This thread will likely be a concurrent work in progress, suggestions are welcome here where i will ensure that current maintainers (if not me) are alerted. This thread is carrying on from previous and every 6 months a new one will be created (As information gets archived and then people cannot reply to the thread with suggestions, or feedback. Also, can we take a minute to wish the previous maker of the general information thread, Onion, who is a mod here, well-health. He has offically been gone for other 4 months on a health leave, and i've only been able to make contact with him for very little time, not even enough to know how he is, lets hope he's doing well.

&#x200B;

For the record, here is the previous brainfog general information thread; [https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/bsybas/brain\_fog\_general\_information\_thread/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/bsybas/brain_fog_general_information_thread/)

There is likely to be a lot of information contained within this thread over-time. To make things easier, examine the headers to understand the topic at hand, to make it easier in finding which ones you are interested in!

# List of Causes

Whilst not currently maintained by me, last time i checked this was a rather comprehensive and more than readable list of causes. If you encounter any issues, comment on here and i'll bring it to the owners attention, i will allow him to make himself known in the comments if he wishes to be PM-contactable for those type of issues also.

Lastly, before the link is made avaliable, i was also requested to put this disclaimer in from the maintainer;

# Administration Issues

If you have any administration issues, being any bullying, harassment, questions, concerns, etc. Please contact me, u/DefunctSprout directly, or the modmail, which i aquired access to. I have been the only mod for several months and directly messaging King or Onion will not yield efficient replies. You may feel free to do so anyway, i'd encourage mod-mail for offical issues, and as i am well known for, my PMs for friendly talk, although both options are avaliable.

# Discord Server

For a short while now, we have also had a discord server! Whilst it isn't all that active, one of my sub-projects aims to change that down the line. Still, we have a good number of members, and im sure that with some spark, conversation could be had. It also gives people a chance to communicate with others in real-time about their situation, and just adds another hint of personsalisation and relationship establishment that perhaps reddit is unable to provide.

Any issues on that server, please do let me know, i have weak tolorance for those who break easily respectible rules established to keep the server safe for all. I actually made a guide to join! I have a generous volunteer making a IOS guide, and an android one will follow. The one i've made is for Desktop computers, here is the link!

# Post Structure

Post structure is something spoken about in the wiki, however the wiki is rather redundant currently as it isn't being maintained, as another system is planned to be put in place. \[Side Note; That being said, volunteers, please message me or the modmail, as any wiki content here can be later removed.\]

Whilst it isn't required, it is a lot easier for people if the intentions of the post is made as clear as possible, that means an accurate as possible title, appropriate flairing, and relevant ""body"" which is the additional text you may put under the title. Furthermore, seperating and making paragraphs is also a good way to increase readability, and obviously, the shorter the post, the more likely it is to be able to get read, unless the subject line is very interesting, its just how it is. To get the most out of your posts, do your best to follow this basic advice to the letter!

# Ruling out causes

Because there are so so so many causes, it can be quite overwhelming to those just starting out, to eliminate causes. Realise and remember that it is infeasible and impossible to rule everything out at once! The way i have done it and personally recommend, is to go by ""Most likely cause"" first, and then once you extensively rule that one out however may be required, if it wasn't the cause, you go to the next ""Most likely cause"" This strategy is effective and prevents yourself from being overwhelmed! This journey is hard, but by following a certain set of principles and going in with a good head, you'll have this in the bag before you know it! :)

9,Brain fog immediately after eating ANYTHING,"Here’s my brain fog story. I’m desperate and looking for any help: 

I was diagnosed with mixed connective tissue disease in 2018 (which is an autoimmune disease). I took a medicine called plaqunill that relieved me of 80-90% of my body pain. After a few months of taking the medication I went to the doctor and the MCTD no longer showed up on my blood work. But soon after taking the meds I realized I would get disoriented after eating anything with salt, sugar or carbs. In the beginning the brain fog wouldn’t last long but it would always happen. I stopped taking the medicine and thought the brain fog would leave, but it never has. It is now 2020 and I have tried everything. The best I feel is when I don’t eat, or eat completely plain food with no carbs salt or sugar, but untill I completely detox my body anything could trigger the fog. Sometimes even water. The fog seems to be conditional on me eating. But this is not normal. I have heard of people getting brain fog from eating certain foods, but not from eating ANYTHING. I have tried a whole bunch of vitamins which would work for awhile, but then stop working. I’ve used 5-http and St. John’s wart. The St. John’s wart was great but recently stopped working. 

my brain fog is now incapacitating. I feel like I’m on drugs and I can’t function. It’s getting worse and worse, please help",fe3u26,19,0.96,45,2020-03-05 23:00:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/fe3u26/brain_fog_immediately_after_eating_anything/,False,False,2020,3
10,Glasses and overcorrection,"So I’ve had overcorrecting glasses for ten years and they gave loads of problems. Got diagnosed with ADD and had a really hard time studying or watching tv. 

Fast forward to last year; switches optometrists and we found out my left eye was 0,75 overcorrected and the right eye just a bit in the astigmatism. It’s ridiculous how much of a difference these new glasses have made. 

In hindsight it did correlate with the brain fog. Whenever I used contact lenses I would not have any issues at all and be clear headed all day long. Just a shame they ruined my eyes because I kept wearing them (or else I would see double or get the fog). 

For me this was a huge part of the solution. However I still get it from time to time. Just yesterday the fog had set in again. Still struggling through this episode. Which is frustrating, because I just finished playing zelda after 90 hours during the past few months without issue. So I know it’s not because of my eyes at the moment. 

I sincerely hope I’m just getting sick or something. And my sleep hasn’t been feeling fulfilling as well, so maybe that’s the culprit. Well see if it fades again. According to my optometrist my astigmatism’s Axis changes whenever my cornea reforms and it can change to as much as 20 degrees. He thinks this is a huge cause of the brain fog since glasses won’t readjust, but it’s unclear if it is. 

However: astigmatism and overcorrection is known to cause brain fog according to this optometrist and he has helped loads of people already. Happy I found him. If you live in the upper part of the Netherlands I can refer you to him if you want to try this out, but I think any good optometrist can help with this.",f4esmg,20,1.0,9,2020-02-15 20:02:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/f4esmg/glasses_and_overcorrection/,False,False,2020,2
11,Holy Sh1t I finally found a sub that has my symptoms... please read,"I have been to the Urgent care twice and ER once with severe “Cloudy brain” and fatigue. 

CBCs normal. Thyroid normal. Iron normal. Getting further bloodwork and Allergy testing done this week. Also getting a CT of my sinuses. 

But here’s whats weird, I’ve noticed that when I’m just hanging out with the guys and drinking beers, basics just in a social setting... I feel okay. It’s like I forget about the Fog. I can’t tell if it’s still there but I’m just preoccupied with my friends and don’t bother or not. When I’m by myself it’s by far the worst. Does anyone else experience this? 

That sort of makes me wonder if this could be anxiety:stress BUT I have an absolutely amazing job and am engaged to the best woman in the world. There’s absolutely nothing stressful in my life. 

My Thoughts, are these possible causes: 

1. Severe deviated septum. I’ve had a Deviated septum for many years. I can barely breathe through my nose at all. I’ve specifically had bad post nasal drip for several months now and I did do the easy “blood” allergy testing back in the summer which revealed “minor mold allergies”. 

2. A virus of some sort. I had very tender lymph nodes and felt very sick several weeks ago. My brain fogginess got worse after the sickness. 

3. Simple deficiency in blood? Vit B/D? Testosterone? EPV?     Hoping blood work tests this..?

4. Sleep Apnea? I am not overweight and do not snore  BUT my GF has woken me up on two separate occasions because she says I stopped breathing while sleeping. And I’ve noticed during daytime their are times I’m like oh crap I need to breathe.

0,Brain fog caused by hyperinsulinemia? MY CURE HERE!!,"If you have brain fog, dizziness, fatigue as your main symptoms LISTEN UP. Eating a high sugar (fructose in fruit/honey/desserts) and carb diet (starchy vegetables/grains/legumes/pasta/bread) will lead to hyperinsulinemia > insulin resistance > less glucose uptake into cell > less ATP production > and low levels of orexin. I believe leptin resistance goes hand in hand with high insulin levels, and the protocol below will reduce leptin levels, but I need to follow this up with more research. This cascade is basically pre-diabetes prior to having affected fasting glucose and insulin levels. Therefore, you CAN have diabetes or insulin resistance with a normal fasting glucose and insulin. Look up the work done by Dr. Joseph Kraft.

I’m posting this after much trail and error, research, suffering, and finally SUCCESS! 💛💛 Thank you, Jesus! This protocol worked for me, taking away 75% of my symptoms within a week. I hope that these points of advice will help someone out there in a similar situation:

1. Intermittent fasting. Start slow and gradually work up to 16:8.
2. Avoid copious snacking/ grazing all day.
3. No meals after 6pm to improve glymphatic emptying.
4. Low carb/ keto diet. Depending on severity of insulin resistance and activity level <30g vs <50g vs <75g vs <100g. Monitor blood glucose and ketone levels to evaluate progress.
5. Exercise daily. HIIT if possible. Walks after meals to reduce blood glucose.
6. Supplements to decrease insulin resistance and support insulin sensitivity: chromium or cinnamon or berberine. Metformin is the pharmaceutical alternative.
7. Green tea daily.
8. Omega 3 from fatty fish. Eat SMASH - sardines, mackerel, anchovies, salmon, herring.
9. Stress management, sleep improvement strategies, nature exposure and sunlight are strategies for any healthy lifestyle. This may sound strange, but mouth taping at night promotes deeper sleep. Look up the work of Dr. Mark Burhenne.
10. Magnesium supplementation.
11. B-complex supplementation.
12. Vitamin C supplementation.
13. Turmeric supplementation.
14. MCT oil daily. C8>C10 blend or just pure C8. 10-40 grams daily.
15. Avoid alcohol, processed foods, sugar, MSG, vegetable oils, natural flavors, gluten, dairy, farmed fish, artificial sweeteners, and conventional corn and soy.
16. Add foods that help increase insulin sensitivity like cinnamon spice, aloe vera, ginger, garlic, apple cider vinegar (ACV), broccoli sprouts, spinach, broccoli and flaxseeds. These recommended foods have been studied, please share if you know of more. 

Try this for 1-2 weeks and you’ll see an improvement in cognition IF your brain fog in theory is caused by very high levels of circulating insulin. I have read many many forums where KETO and IF are major tools that help alleviate symptoms. After digging into the research and trying this protocol myself, I believe I found a strong connection with brain fog/fatigue and hyperinsulinema. If any/all of these steps decreases your symptoms please submit a follow up post and leave your feedback below. God bless anyone who is silently suffering without answers 🙏🏽 Keep looking, you will find the path that is right for your body.

1,Severe cognitive impairment. Life doesn't feel real.,"I'm in serious need of some help. I apologize if my writing comes across as incoherent, my mind isn't what it used to be. I posted something very similar in /r/leaves as I believe this could have been triggered by marijuana but I've never been a heavy user.

For 7 months now it feels like I've been experiencing what i'd describe as a really bad hangover. I'm severely cognitively impaired and lost my job because I couldn't do the work anymore (I was a programmer at a big company). I see things out of the corner of my eyes similar to what you experience when sleep deprived but I don't feel tired. My mind takes several seconds to recognize/process ordinary objects. I feel maybe 10% of the emotions I used to. I cannot get mad, sad, anxious or feel empathy anymore. I'm a robot in dream world.

It is important that I emphasize just how bad my cognitive function currently is, I always have difficulty explaining this to doctors. Life does not feel real. Critical thinking is impossible. Short term memory is non-existent. Some days it's hard for me to even walk in a straight line. I do NOT have good days but the severity still varies. How I feel when I wake up seems to be the baseline and the impairment either maintains or worsens until I fall asleep.

I have had a lot of testing done (bloodwork, CT scans, EEGs) but they cannot find anything wrong. I have tried three day long water fasts on two occasions to rule out allergies. I am currently taking Lamotragine prescribed by my Neurologist but like most other medications it has done nothing to improve my condition. The one thing that seems to have any effect at all is a dose of NAC right before bed. My vision and recognition abilities are better the next morning but it has no effect when taken during the day.

I am 31 and healthy. Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this.",g83vpv,50,0.98,35,2020-04-25 23:39:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/g83vpv/severe_cognitive_impairment_life_doesnt_feel_real/,False,False,2020,4

3,Brain fog for 7 years.,"I just want to vent. I'm so glad there's a subreddit for this.

I've had brain fog for 7 years straight now. Back in the winter of 2013, I noticed for about 2 weeks that I was feeling more tired than usual, and had an odd symptom where my eyes would be super watery in the mornings. One night I went to bed and I just couldn't fall asleep at all. I only managed to get a broken 4 fours and by morning the brain fog had set in and I felt horrendous. Since then I haven't been able to sleep without taking mirtazapine (remeron). It's 7 years now and it just gets worse all the time. When I go to doctors and describe my brain fog, they just look at me confused like they think I'm just making it all up and tell me to get some exercise. I've repeatedly had blood tests and a CAT scan on my head, nothing was found. I've tried meditation for HOURS in the day and it doesn't help. I am absolutely sick to my backteeth of living like this, it is just awful. I'm living in a state where I just feel like my mind is disconnected from reality and I'm slowly slipping into madness. Everynight I go to bed I have nightmares or extremely vivid dreams. I asked my doctor for a sleep test and he said no. Even though I can't sleep without taking mirtazapine (it regulates my broken sleep pattern).

I just feel so bad guys and I'm left completely in the dark about what this is caused by. I'm depressed but BECAUSE of the brain fog, I wasn't depressed before. And I feel like I'm starting to develop other psychological conditions like psychosis because of the way brain fog is making me think. Not to mention, that because my mind is in such a poor state, and I'm sleep deprived, I'm ageing prematurely which is adding to my depression.

I'm sorry, not looking for answers here I just woke up from yet another night of awful sleep and really wanted to vent.

6,For those who found their symptoms relieved through neck stretches and spinal exercises,"So I stumbled upon a youtube video recently of a russian chiropractor and he was doing a special exercise for a condition called osteochondrosis of the cervical spine, I said heck why don't I go for it. it was night and the video lasted 10min I did it and I went to sleep. To my big surprise I woke up refreshed and clear mentally. I haven't felt that way for ages, so I decided to give it another shot thinking that two sets a day can help alleviate the fog and maintain mental clarity throughout the day. But little did I know that my desire for sleep dwindled and disappeared completely.
What I lacked in sleep I made up for mental clarity. So I think I'll stick with one set a day and see how things will go down. Has any of you found their sleep deprived through any similar exrcises?

It's hit me on and off throughout my life. Started in my early 20's when I had insomnia. I noticed it was actually middle insomnia. I would wake up every 30 minutes to an hour. This lasted almost two months. It's been on and off since then, but only once every year or two.

Since then, my sleep schedule has to be kept pretty consistent. A long nap may disrupt my sleep schedule and I'm battling middle insomnia for a week or two. If I wake up in the middle of the night, stay up for a few hours and then drift back to sleep...forget it. I'm going to have all of this again for a week or two.

**This time it's slightly different!**

I have no idea what messed up my deep sleep, but it's been off and I've been in a pretty rough brain fog on and off every day for a week. I'm looking for pointers or tips. It's rather depressing. I try to enjoy my family and kids, but I'm so out of it. I'm in this constant dream like state, and I'm making it worse because I can't stop thinking about how much it sucks! The good thing is some days are better than others. I felt like I slept better last night and got sleep without waking up from 1-6, but I don't think it was deep sleep. I'm still feeling out of it. Maybe it's not my sleeping, I'm not sure.

**Any tips?**

Any tips for getting better, deeper sleep? Any tips for just dealing with it and trying to focus on the moment with family around?

**My tip!**

This might be known. If you're brain fog is caused from sleeping issues where you don't really have a consistent sleep and wake up time, this has worked to put me back on track. This usually works and I get deep sleep too.

You eat an early dinner and fast for about 14-16 hours and eat a good sized breakfast at the time you want to wake up. So, if I want to wake up at 7AM every morning, I'll eat dinner at either 4PM or 5PM and eat a big breakfast right at 7AM. This has at the very least helped reset my sleep schedule that was off. I usually return to a pretty good deep sleep too. This has probably helped and worked for me about 90% of the time.",g9pluo,21,1.0,17,2020-04-28 15:47:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/g9pluo/brain_fog_from_lack_of_deep_sleep/,False,False,2020,4
8,Made the discovery today that my brain fog is from anxiety :,"Hi there I’ve been dealing with memory slash thinking issues for a long time now. I can’t think clearly and every 10 seconds or so I forget what I’m thinking about. I also can’t watch new tv shows or retain too much information without it affecting my thinking . 

I’ve been on Buspirone (for Anxiety) for about two years and I recently decided to increase my dosage from 20 mg to 30 mg. 

Boy did it help clear my memory and make me think clearly again. The only problem is I felt too “robotic” on the 30 mg so I’ve decided to stay on the 20mg and try and tackle my anxiety / brain fog in other ways instead of increasing my medication.

My point is that I’ve found the root of my memory problem (anxiety) and now I can work towards lowering my anxiety and getting my brain back !",g6b2kw,20,0.93,19,2020-04-22 22:38:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/g6b2kw/made_the_discovery_today_that_my_brain_fog_is/,False,False,2020,4

1,Possible cause of my brain fog!,"I’ve had constant brain fog for 3 months now and I finally found a possible cause for it! I visited an ENT surgeon who had a look at my MRI from a week after the symptoms started and my CT scan from a week ago and he told me that I have an infection in my fontal right sinus which has progressed since the MRI scan. This wasn’t previously picked up on the MRI.

I have done some research and apparently this can cause brain fog so I’m really hoping this is the cause. I’ve been put on a strong dose of antibiotics and cortisone so hopefully I’ll feel better soon! I’ve literally had every test possible while finding a heart condition totally unrelated called Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome which I recently had a procedure for (which came with additional complications).

Anyways if this is the cause I’ll share my full story and the steps I took to rule out all possible causes. I’m glad there are others who know what I’m going through and I really hope I can help a lot of you out!",gscra9,40,1.0,37,2020-05-28 19:20:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/gscra9/possible_cause_of_my_brain_fog/,False,False,2020,5
2,Current Remedies for Brain Fog [My personal experience],"Hey guys!

&#x200B;

First and foremost, this subreddit has been a huge help for me. I'll keep it short and sweet - I'm a 24 year old male, I started having a severe onset of brain fog when I was about 18 (I still don't know why it happened, but whatever). I wake up and go to sleep with constant brain fog, my memory sometimes goes to shit (I just had a memory test done from one of the best neurology hospitals in the world and I'm above average for my age for my memory - kind of interesting how that works), and I find myself battling with anxiety, depression, and random spurts of ADD (I don't have it - I just lose focus frequently.) 

&#x200B;

Anyways, I've done every test, every supplement, and have gone to about 8 doctors (all very well known in the medical world.) 

&#x200B;

I wanted to give you guys my current remedies, just in case this could change someone's life. I know how terrible brain fog is and how literally every single doctor has zero idea how to treat it. 

&#x200B;

* Go get a sleep apnea test done - even if it's mild, or unnoticeable, you're not getting deep sleep/your brain isn't getting the oxygen it needs EVERY NIGHT. I found out from my sleep study I barely have sleep apnea, but I have restless leg syndrom (it can be treated with prescription pills every night) and I don't get enough REM sleep. 
   * I'm getting a mouthpiece made right now from my dentist as there is no way I can sleep with a CPAP machine.
* Test your hormones - sometimes it could be you have super high or super low estrogen, low test levels, hyperthyroidism, etc. 
* If you have anxiety or depression, don't leave it untreated. 
   * Currently, taking prozac and buspar. These have been a godsend for what seemed like untreatable social and general anxiety w/ depression. 
   * For me, sometimes my brain fog can be increased from anxiety or depression. It's best to try to level it out. 
* Make sure you're taking vitamins, DAILY.
   * Get yourself a good athletic multivitamin - I take the Pure Athletic Multivitamin - they're awesome. 
   * Make sure you're taking anti-inflammatory supps - Tumeric is fantastic.
   * Glutathione is another really great one.
   * Vitamin D, B12 
* See if you have leaky gut, GI issues
   * Brain fog is a ""symptom"" of another issue you may have. Try to take some probiotics, look into different supplements you may take to restore your GI / help with leaky gut. 
* Cut out stimulants - caffeine tends to amp up your adrenals and can increase your fog. I know if you wake up tired every single day - like me - you want to immediately down some coffee or caffeine. Try to find some vitamin energy blends that work for you. 
* Try drinking one teaspoon of baking soda every morning
   * This sounds super crazy, but my naturopathic doctor is well respected by my state's professional sports organizations and he told me that this was a godsend for some people he treats. Sometimes, your body's PH can be far too acidic - **IF YOU DRINK COFFEE OR CAFFEINATED DRINKS, THIS WILL MAKE YOUR BODY EVEN MORE ACIDIC.**  And that can cause you to have brain fog. 
   * Note, you will need to try this for a few weeks - it's not an immediate fix. 
* Exercise 
   * Self explanatory. Go for a bike ride, a walk, go box, go work out. That extra weight isn't doing you any justice, and not feeling confident about yourself will throw your mental health into a spin and throw your stress levels up = higher brain fog. 
* Speaking of stress... 
   * Try some adrenal restoration supplements - if you have high stress, your adrenals are probably shot. 
* Get a therapist 
   * Seriously, best decision I've ever made. 

&#x200B;

This is everything I'm currently doing. I just started this regiment on Monday - I've been chasing doctors for years... literally years. I'm hoping this at least alleviates my fog by 25% - I'll be happy.

&#x200B;

Good luck everyone - and let me know if you've done something that was life changing for you. I'm always willing to try.",gf9rg9,31,0.91,18,2020-05-07 16:26:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/gf9rg9/current_remedies_for_brain_fog_my_personal/,False,False,2020,5

5,Is your diet causing your Brain Fog? Here is how to find out!," Brain fog can affect concentration, executive function, decision-making, and **memory**...

it REALLY REALLY REALLY SUCKS TO HAVE **BRAIN FOG**...

There are many **possible causes**...

* Stress
* Medical conditions
* Medication
* Hormonal changes
* Lack of sleep

but if you always feel brain fog after certain meals, then it might worth it to test your diet...

Within your diet, there could be many possible causes. It could be an allergy, intolerance, overeating, eating the same things or maybe the problem involves refined carbohydrates, processed foods, trans fats, artificial sweeteners, or alcohol.

According to [healthline.com](http://health.com/), the elimination diet is the gold standard for identifying allergies and intolerances.

**Elimination diet in a nutshell**

Essentially the elimination diet is pretty simple...

You **prepare** for it, you **eliminate** certain foods until symptoms disappear, you **reintroduce** them back one at a time and you **evaluate** which foods you think might be triggering your symptoms.

But this doesn't answer the question of which foods to eliminate, if now is the right time and more, so let's get into more detail...

# Prepare:

**Is now the right time?**

The first phase is preparation

First, you need to ask yourself: is it the right time for an elimination diet?

Keep in mind that you need to be able to eliminate certain foods, track your symptoms and everything you eat vigorously, and possibly keep doing this for some weeks. So if you are really busy, traveling or want to eat out a lot, then now might not be the ideal time.

But if you decide that now is the right time, then the first step is to contact your doctor, to rule out other possible causes of your brain fog. If you have an allergy, then the symptoms can potentially be life-threatening.

**Make a list of foods to avoid:**

Next, you need to make a list of foods to avoid.

But how do you know which foods to avoid? and how many?

If you don't have any idea about what might be triggering you, then you can either buy a food sensitivity test or spend some time tracking everything you eat, as well as any symptoms that might arise.. But keep in mind that while symptoms usually arise within a few hours of eating the trigger food, it could be delayed by up to 48 hours, which would make it very hard to pinpoint.

It's also worthwhile to know the most common triggers:

&#x200B;

* For allergies, the big 8 is: milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybean.
* Some common food sensitivities are: Dairy, wheat, gluten, caffeine, salicylates, histamine, FODMAPs, sulfites, fructose, artificial sweeteners, colorings, and flavorings.

And in order to decide how many foods to eliminate, it's important to remember that there might be more than one food that is causing you trouble, and if you just eliminate one of them, then you will still experience symptoms and have to do it all over again.

On the other hand, eliminating too many foods is harder to adhere to, and you are at a bigger risk of creating nutritional deficiencies, which might cause new symptoms to occur. So choosing which foods to avoid is a balancing act.

Once you know what to eliminate, write down all things that contain that thing. For example, if gluten is on your list, then write down all things that contain gluten.

**Make a list of what to eat instead:**

It's also important to make a list of what you are going to eat instead, to make sure you are prepared and aren't going to face any nutritional deficiencies.

**Prepare in which order you want to reintroduce foods:**

At last, you'll want to make a plan for the order in which you will reintroduce the foods you have eliminated. Here you can prioritize starting with the foods you miss the most, the most healthy ones or the one you think are the least likely to cause you trouble.

You can try different forms of the same food separately. For example, trying the white part and the yellow part of an egg separately. It can also be a good idea to try pure forms of your trigger food, like pure wheat if you suspect that might be your trigger.

## Elimination:

The next phase is the elimination. Here you remove all the foods from your list for 2-4 weeks and write down if you notice any symptoms still occurring. You need to have been completely symptom-free for 5 days before moving on to the next phase. If you haven't been symptom-free for at least 5 days at the end of the 2-4 weeks, then consider removing other foods and doing 2-4 additional weeks. But be aware that you could have created a nutritional deficiency because of the foods you eliminated.

## Reintroduction:

The next phase is the reintroduction. Here you reintroduce one food at a time and track any symptoms that might occur. You should wait 3-7 days before introducing a new food since it can take 48 hours for symptoms to occur, and also because you might be able to tolerate some amount of your trigger foods.

If you experience symptoms but are unsure if the food you reintroduced was the trigger, then wait 5 days, until you don't have any symptoms and try reintroducing the food again. But if you reintroduce some food and are certain that the food is the culprit, then wait with introducing the next food until you don't experience any symptoms.

## Evaluate:

The last phase is the evaluation. Now you should evaluate how certain you feel that you found your trigger foods. If you are uncertain about a few of the foods, then you might run the experiment again with those foods.

Also remember that you might be able to handle some amount of your trigger foods, and your sensitivity to foods can change over time.

If you choose to eliminate some foods entirely, then it can be worthwhile to find some replacement foods that make sure you still get all the nutrients you need.

6,"My brain lifted for an entire week, and it was wonderful, and also confusing","So I’ve been dealing with severe and intense brain fog for about 5 straight months. It crept up on me initially, and then it hit me like a ton of bricks one evening shortly after I developed chronic pain in my right leg and buttocks, and never went away. You guys all know the deal: confusion, can’t think, can’t remember, can barely speak properly, living in a haze, and depression.   

Anyways, during this time I was obviously freaked out, went and saw several doctors, and tried several different remedies. Nothing seemed to be working and my fog was getting worse and worse with each passing day. My doctors originally thought I had an autoimmune disease, now they are not too sure but the investigation continues.    

Fast forward to about 2 weeks ago, I saw a new rheumatologist because I was sick of the misery.  He again told me that he didn’t think I had an AI disease, but recommended I double my dose of Aleve that I had been taking for the pain everyday to the absolute maximum dose every 12 hours. So I did just that, and then the magic happened.   

Within 48 hours, my brain fog improved by about 90%. It was amazing; I felt like the old me again, although I was still in pain and had brief moments of fuzziness. This continued for an entire week and I was able to do so many things: exercised, had sex, visited family, worked, etc. It was true bliss as I almost had forgotten what it was like to feel normal.    

Unfortunately, the reprieve was short lived. After a week, I slowly started to feel the fog creep back in. After 3 days of fighting the fog back, it returned with a vengeance, and now I feel worse than ever :(.   

But now I have some hope. This week of glory has taught me so much about what is happening to me, and now here is what I know:    

-there has not been any permanent brain damage done, as my full faculties returned when my fog cleared.   
-the cause of my fog is definitely inflammatory in nature.  
-my gut definitely has some sort of relationship with my fog (NSAIDs wreak all sorts of havoc on your gut)
-remission, and maybe even permanent remission is possible.   

So that’s what I have learned and where I currently stand. I’m not really sure where I can go from here but I think I definitely have some evidence based options. I hope this information helps some of you too as we continue with this fight.",glya8w,27,0.94,12,2020-05-18 09:28:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/glya8w/my_brain_lifted_for_an_entire_week_and_it_was/,False,False,2020,5

9,Brain fog free after 9 years!,"I first started having brain fog in my last year of school in 2011, I couldn't take in my surroundings, read, speak, or think properly. 

  
Four years later, I'd failed half my exams, struggled through college and even had to give up skateboarding because of brain fog. I was being completely withdrawn from the world, I couldn't hold a conversation properly. I was loosing friends and the only enjoyment I was getting out of life was drinking coffee, eating and sleeping (which sounds nice enough but believe me it wasn't) Doctors had told me I just needed to relax and enjoy life, I assume they thought I was on drugs or just had anxiety, I found it very difficult to explain what I was feeling to my friends and family. I felt like my brain was rotting away. I had tried different lifestyle changes, eating a new diet, stressing less, sleeping more and nothing worked. At this point I figured if this didn't get this sorted my brain would slowly shut off and my body would soon follow, I genuinely thought this was going to kill me.

I read the term ""Brain Fog"" online and I KNEW that was what I had. I had found a doctor, naturopath ""Eric Bakker"" £60 for a 40 minute Skype call, sounds reasonable? He stayed on the phone with me for 1 hour 20 minutes listening to my story. He told me I need a food allergy test, he armed me with the information I needed to convince this lab in Germany to send me a kit to get the plasma from my blood, I took it to a private doctors and they helped me.   
Three weeks later I was emailed a PDF of all the foods im allergic to, It was off the charts. Gluten, dairy, egg, yeast, tomatoes, spelt, rye, he told me stop eating ALL of them for three months and call me back. I felt a little better but not a big change, he told me carry on and stop nicotine, caffeine and anything else you are putting in your body. 2 months later I feel great, Im still fine tuning to this day but I would sat 90-95% of my brain fog has been eradicated.

My advice is dont give up! learn your body! only you can help yourself with brain fog. 

I would recommend working with someone like Eric Bakker to the fullest. He also has a youtube channel which I will link.

I cant concentrate while doing anything. Having to read a book for example. One sentence has to be read a few times before i can process it. I used to be able to speed read really quickly and still capture critical information.

Exercise gets me really tired. But not physically. Mentally. It feels like my brain is just fading away.

13,What helped my brain fog,"Hello, I just wanted to share what helped me end most of my brain fog. 

I have Thalassemia, it's a type of anemia that is an inherited blood disorder. Basically, I have fewer hemoglobin and red blood cells than other people.
I went to a hematologist and he prescribed me a supplement for iron and vitamin c to help absorption. After a while treating it, my brain fog got A LOT better. 

The important note is that my diet has always been balanced and even eating meat and other foods rich in iron, it was NEVER enough to even up the Thalassemia. So I have to take medication from time to time.
Also, it is a common condition in people with some Italian background. 
But I had no other symptoms related to it. I didn't feel weakness or shortness of breath. I exercised normally and didn't feel sick or would pass out.

I also treat insomnia and, in my case, that is heavily linked to brain fog.

15,How to deal with the anxiety and stress caused by brain fog.,Been dealing with brain fog for 4 years now since graduating high school actually(pretty sure was caused by an event in my life).My question to those who are dealing or have dealt with brain fog in the past. Is if you guys have learned or picked up any tips or hacks that have lowered your stress levels during high stress situations because let’s face it brain fog severely lowers the confidence in your intelligence levels. For example for me when I’m given simple instructions or told to go do something for them. I get extremely nervous my brain basically shuts down and I can’t think properly pretty much feels like a hot breeze keeps hitting me.Basically to make things a little easier to understand. What I’m looking for is a way to keep calm when I’m told to go do something or given simple instructions. Interestingly I’ve noticed that I’m able to understand and think more clearly when I’m not stressed out. I say the word interestingly because for the past 3 years I thought my comprehension issues were unfixable. It wasn’t until a therapist taught me a technique where I was able to keep calm under these situations. And follow through the basic instructions more efficiently that I started to ask myself if I really did have serious issues. (technique doesn’t work anymore). To be honest I’m not so sure what percentage of the comprehension issues are actually just in my head or I really do have legitimate comprehension problems.

16,Kind of like a dreamy dazed state of mind.,"Not sure if this fits into brain fog or not. About a month ago I drank alot of coffee like 8 cups. I was very addicted at the time to caffeine.  Well, later that day my heart started racing and I couldn't barely catch my breath. I went to the urgent care and they gave me and EKG chest. X-ray everything was normal. 

The next morning I woke up feeling like I'm Ina dream almost. If I could describe it it's like a lightheadedness dazed feeling 24/7.  Since then I had blood work done another chest x-ray all normal. 

At times I forget about it but I seems to creep up on me again. I researched derealization but it's not quite that more of a feeling like your gonna faint but not quite. It's so weird. 

If anyone has any experience with this I would appreciate any response.",gp4yzh,19,1.0,22,2020-05-23 13:32:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/gp4yzh/kind_of_like_a_dreamy_dazed_state_of_mind/,False,False,2020,5
17,Is this Brain fog?,"28F. As long as I can remember, I’ve had issues with memory loss. I don’t remember a lot of things in the short or long term. I also can’t see my thoughts (visualize), everything is a grey screen. I am hyper aware of my flaws by I can’t make myself change anything (bad habits, healthy changes). It feels like I’m not behind the wheel. I never complete a task *just* right, I always forget or mess things up. I both feel a lot of emotions but can’t connect with them. No real hobbies, things aren’t interesting enough for me to put energy into. I’m always tired. I’ve always struggled with depression and anxiety but for years I have felt completely disconnected from myself. Everything feels like various shades of grey. I’ve missed and forgotten things in my child’s life from just being checked out. Being hyper aware while also disconnected is really wearing at my will to live. If it’s brain fog, maybe I can start working towards an answer. Help?",gebldz,18,0.96,15,2020-05-06 02:31:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/gebldz/is_this_brain_fog/,False,False,2020,5
0,Unbelievable improvement in just 10 days after 10 years of suffering,"Hello guys, I'm new here but not new to the brain fog. I've been battling brain fog since 10 years without any success until now. I'm not a native english speaker, so excuse me if I make some mistakes but I wanted to share what worked for me.

My symptoms were:

\- inability to focus

\- extremely slow processing speed when reading, listening, studying

\- not remembering the right word to say, it's like it's stuck in my tongue and I can't find it

\- anxiety

\- lack of motivation

\- always having to re-read every sentence because I can't understand the meaning on the first try

\- constant and extreme fatigue

\- depression

\- short term memory problems

\- forgetfulness

What I tried to cure it without success:

\- Supplements (I tried a lot of them.....anti fungals, anti worms, anti parasites, omega 3, vitamin b complex (both methylated and not), vitamin c, vitamin d, vitamin k2, iron, zinc, bioavailable copper, selenium, NAC, resveratrol, apigenin, luteolin, curcumin, Huperzine A, Alpha GPC, prebiotics, probiotics, creatine, l-glutamine and many many others). I didn't notice any success.

\- Hormonal therapies: tried testosterone, DHEA, pregnenolone and other compounds without effects for my brain fog.

\- Gut cleansing with edema and hydrotherapy.

\- Blood analysis including for blood glucose, Cholesterol and all the other common ones (all were normal)

\- Physical exercise

\- Meditation (I even went on a retreat in Thailand)

\- Eliminating all toxic and changing house thinking there may have been some hidden toxic mold

\- Heavy metals chelation

\- Sleeping 12 hours per day and changing mattress

\- Excluding all kind of technology from my life

\- Taking a gap year to reduce my stress to zero

\- Sleep study to verify if I had sleep apnea.

\- Nose surgery to make sure there was enough air coming in to supply oxygen to my brain

\- Massages and chiropractic sessions

\- Drinking 10 coffee per day

\- Antidepressants

\- Cognitive therapy with psychologists and hypnosis

\- And many others that I'm not gonna list or this post would be extremely long.

If you noticed that one thing is missing on the list you are right: it's the diet. I was always a picky eater, disliked many foods and ate unhealthy foods and didn't believe foods could have an impact on my brain fog. I thought it was just some woo woo bullshit preached by functional doctors and my GP actually agreed with that. I refused to believe foods caused my brain fog and actually I didn't want to change my diet because tasty (but unhealthy) foods were the only things that kept me sane during all this. Moreover if all my friends could eat the same foods I ate without experiencing symptoms, why would I experience them? If foods were a problem it should have been for everybody not just for me. It didn't make sense to me on a logical level (and still doesn't tbh). 

Unfortunately after everything else failed and seeing more and more people mentioning foods as the culprit and how they healed I decided to try it because my life was such a mess. I lost all jobs, lost my girlfriend, couldn't grasp the meaning of simple sentences anymore without re-reading them multiple times, couldn't find the words to make a coherent sentence ecc. Basically I was suicidal and there was nothing else to do. I also developed other problems including chronic migraines, severe joint pain, restless leg syndrome and others.

Initially I only took gluten out of my diet because it was the ingredient people mentioned the most as the culprit and I already thought that was incredibly hard since gluten is pretty much in all the foods I ate back then. Cutting gluten from my diet was the first thing that helped me somewhat get better and I saw the effects pretty soon, like in less than a week. But my brain fog was still there. I just replaced junk gluten containing foods, with junk gluten free foods. Since I got better I knew I was onto something and so I decided to start eating many healthy foods like lots of vegetables, avocado, berries, nuts, wild caught salmon, green tea ecc....my brain fog and all other symptoms got increasingly better after a few days but there was still some brain fog there.

In the end I decided to cut all unhealthy or deemed inflammatory foods from my diet and see if I could further improve. So other than gluten I cut dairy, eggs, all sort of sugar, soy, all grains, nightshade vegetables, processed meat, red meat and generally all processed foods....all the while eating healthy foods. What an effect! In just 10 days my brain fog evaporated for the first time in 10 year. I have so much energy, I can concentrate on things, I don't need to re-read sentences to understand the meaning, my processing speed greatly improved and my motivation skyrocketed. My anxiety (which I thought was a genetic trait) also greatly diminished. I feel like a new person and can't believe the effect it had on me.

As a side note, I also exercise 6x per week and practice meditation 3x per week but I used to do these things before while eating an unhealthy diet and they didn't improve my condition at all. I think they do have a synergistic effect but only with a very healthy diet.

Same thing can be said for supplements, many of them are probably beneficial but I couldn't feel anything because my diet was bad and so they couldn't work in that condition.

I hope this help some of you curing your brain fog. I personally believe that at least 90% of cases of brain fog are related to diet. It's tough to change and give up confort food and eating bland and unappealing foods but that's the only thing that cured me and pretty fast too. I lost 10 years of my life battling brain fog, it caused so many problems and failures in my life but finally I can look at the future with optimism.

I don't know if I can add back those foods in the future, I looked online about people who experienced the same effects and many did add many of the foods back except maybe gluten. Right now I prefer not to risk it for a while but I will definitely try to add some of them back in the future even though now that I know the importance of a healthy diet I don't desire to eat junk food anymore.

I decided to share it so you too have an opportunity to heal and take back your life. Just remember to be strict with the diet. Cheating, even in minimal amount, can compromise your healing. If you are serious about getting rid of your brain fog you have to commit with the diet 100%.",hb1lb1,143,0.99,43,2020-06-17 22:22:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/hb1lb1/unbelievable_improvement_in_just_10_days_after_10/,False,False,2020,6

3,About 80% of my brain fog is gone after doing the following,"After making the following adjustments to my daily lifestyle, almost all of my brain fog has cleared up:

* **Wake up at the same time each morning** \- This is far more important than going to sleep at a set time.
* **Eat a high fat low carb breakfast at the same time each morning** \- When you sleep your blood sugar levels drop quite drastically since you are in a fasting state. When you eat a breakfast that is high in carbs or sugars your blood sugar elevates from this low state, which might explain the morning energy some of you might experience, and then crashes at around midday possibly contributing to BF. It's also important to eat at the same time every morning as your digestive enzymes run on a clock and can cause digestive issues if you eat at sporadic times.
* **Avoid caffeine -** I know many of you rely on coffee to get shit done but this seriously improved my BF.  I found that a morning coffee would seriously mess with my digestion which may have been a contributing factor. 
* **Avoid sugar -** Sugar can cause gut issues which is a known cause of BF.
* **An apple a day keeps the doctor away -** Apples are extremely good for your gut.
* **Get into a routine -** Helps you adjust to your environment and provides some consistency to your life. 
* **Exercise -** Mainly cardio and HIIT exercises, a lot of studies show improves cognition.
* **Omega 3s and Vitamin C** \- Smoked salmon and tuna are high in omega 3s which are also known to improve cognition. Vitamin C helps convert carbohydrates to energy and has helped a lot personally.",gwryh8,80,0.99,18,2020-06-04 22:36:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/gwryh8/about_80_of_my_brain_fog_is_gone_after_doing_the/,False,False,2020,6

5,"Don't worry, you're smarter than you think.","I have suffered with severe brain fog for almost 2 decades now. For a long time, I believed I was just dumb, and developed great insecurity and depression because of that. However, occasionally, when I get the factors just right, I have moments of clarity where I feel like everything is operating smoothly and properly. When this happens, I am amazed and just how intelligent and clever I truly am. Even through extreme difficulty with attention, focus, and difficulty with conscious processing, my brain has clearly absorbed an incredible amount of information and done a lot processing subconsciously. When I have these moments, it is a great breath of relief, and I often have others complimenting my intelligence. So the point of this post is to remind you that you can stop worrying, and just trust that the billions of complex connections that form the most complex system we know of in the universe known as the brain is still doing profound work. Brain fog is just a challenge with experiencing this intense depth with conscious awareness. It's going to be okay. Keep working at it. With work and insight, you too will experience momentary and gradual amelioration of symptoms and realize that you inherit a very complex and intelligent biological system. You are still beautiful and smart, and a good place to start is gratitude for any existence at all. Keep on keeping on! It will get better of you look here, now, and forward, and not back.

6,Former brain fog victim fully recovered!,"Hi guys! I know and feel how debilitating your condition is. It is terrifying. I have had depression over two years now with different medications, but in December things took a really bad turn after some traumatic events. 

I found that I lost the ability to speak due to a combination of inner anxiety and self-consciousness which would make me stop halfway through a sentence. In a one hour therapy session I was so embarrassed to find that I could communicate hardly a sentence or two. I was having a hard time following films on TV, was dissociating and found it hard to focus. This was the most terrifying time of my life and I would constantly lurk on this subreddit, hoping to find a solution and feeling very neurotic about my future. I promised myself that one day, if I found a solution, I would let you guys know.

An MRI scan revealed nothing abnormal. In terms of medication for my depression, I insisted on vortioxetine, which I started 15mg in January, and I believe thanks to it, it has helped turn my life around (took 6 weeks for me to feel a therapeutic effect).

Thank the lords because I am back to my happy self now, every now and again I get self conscious, but it is very mild and under my control. I can happily speak, write emails, think on the fly etc. things that I was terrified I couldn't do. I am confidently studying, partaking in hobbies etc.

So my message to you is don't give up hope. There is a solution somewhere. My experiences have inspired me to study neuroscience at university and I hope one day to make significant contributions to the field :)

Looking back, I don't think anything was structurally wrong with my brain, but rather the chemical and biological function of it, coupled with the stressors at that point in time. This has been aided with this rather new SNRI that supposedly has pro cognitive effects for those experiencing cognitive deficits in their depression. I hope this has been of some use :)",h99lhj,59,1.0,19,2020-06-15 05:16:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/h99lhj/former_brain_fog_victim_fully_recovered/,False,False,2020,6

9,What is it with brain fog in combination with head pressure?,"One of the most noticable symptoms accompanying the general ""brain fog"" (feeling like your brain and thinking ability is dulled compared to what it used to be, like a butter knife to a sharp blade) is this odd sensation of pressure on my forehead which sometimes also feels like it's wrapping around my head or pressuring the back top side of my head. It is not painful, just very confusing and it's intensitiy seems to correlate heavily with the intensity of my brain fog. In moments where I notice that my head feels like a weight has been lifted off of it I can be 99% sure that I am also going to be able to think clearly, understand what is being said to me and follow through with basic tasks that would usually overwhelm my fogged up brain. When my brainfog started a bit over a year ago the very first symptom I noticed was this pressure feeling, a bit later I noticed that my cognitive ability had gotten worse aswell.

I've heard of many cases where this kind of pressure has been brought up in combination with brain fog and I'm sure some of you that have clicked on this thread can relate aswell. Tell me about your experience with brain fog and head pressure and let me know about the things you've found out to increase quality of life or even to get rid of brain fog completely.

11,A little hope,"Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I haven't posted in a long time as I realized that for me not thinking about or putting the brainfog at the center of my attention was very helpful.

I just wanted to share some positivity for those of you who are at the brink of giving up, or who think that life has to be hard - is hard - and will continue being so forever.

I've recognized that I've passed on from the worst stage of my brainfog. It all happens very gradually, and surely there are some horrible days, but things have slowly gotten better. Before I would sometimes come to the attention of my brainfog as when waking from a bad dream and completely panic - but now I've come to accept how things are, and my limited capabilities. 

I think we should all find great strength in knowing that we are - most likely - fighting double as hard, trying to operate at double the pace and struggling more than most people in just doing average things. Add those of us who have very demanding lives, or just those who have a very debilitating brain fog and things become much more difficult. 

Personally, I'm in the best ""flow""-state I've ever been, and yet I feel like I'm only operating at 60-70 percent of what I know I used to, and could be capable of.

This feeling is probably the worst.

However the opposite is true: imagine how magnificently powerful we will be when we lift our fogs, knowing what it's like to only be at 10,20,40,60 percent. 

It really helped me to hear u/ryang06 and u/willy11c talking about what it's like ""on the other side"" - and realizing that that other side does in fact exist. For me I think the worst part about the fog has been the sheer panic and desperation of feeling like I'm going to be trapped - like a genie in a jar - for the rest of my life; always held back by this invisible and (so far) unidentifiable source.

I've tried about everything at this point, and figured that I will just have to wait and see. Now, however I've been admitted for nasal surgery due to a clogged nose and it seems that there are yet many horizons to discover. I'm keeping my expectations low, and my mind positive regardless.

&#x200B;

I've really really seen the worst of the brainfog and even though I haven't beat it (yet) I just wanted to let all of you who are down in that worst pit of despair know that it does get better over time: if not the fog itself, it helps to learn to change your attitude and to limit your expectations as to fit the reality of our limited capabilities. 

&#x200B;

I think there there is much more virtue in working hard DESPITE of an obstacle. Anyone can achieve great feats; few can do it with a debilitating and invisible devil on their shoulders telling them that they don't amount to anything. I'm proud to say that I'm performing relatively well despite having been dragged down to rock bottom by the fog - and carried myself up from there, step by step and everyday proving myself wrong by navigating myself - to the best of my ability - through the fog. And I'm equally immensely proud of all of you who keep trying, or who are just clinging on to whatever last strains of hope or sheer willpower you have left.

&#x200B;

There is a green patch out there meant for each and everyone of us - we just have to hold on to see that day. The pride and bliss we'll feel will hopefully make up for all the hard times.

&#x200B;

All the best to all of you, I hope this helps someone <3",gwcvyh,29,1.0,4,2020-06-04 07:47:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/gwcvyh/a_little_hope/,False,False,2020,6

13,Word recall issues and poor comprehention,"Hi this is my first post on reddit, i have been looking for a place to share my story about the cognitive issues im facing now today, i can relate to a lot of the same issues in this community concerning brain fog and cognitive difficulties. 
I have been trying to figur out ""what's wrong with me"" for the past 6 months. 
I am a 27 years old male and I would consider my self as a creative entusatic person up until just recently. 
That being said i've also struggled with drug addictions in short periodes of time like marijuana cocaine and speed.
I didn't experiment with any drugs until i was legally an adult 18, and I started smoking cannabis daily at 22. 
I dont really consider marijuana as a harmful drug because of the health benefits it  can provide for people with chronic health issues. Cannabis really helped me relax and somehow felt like a cognitive enchancer for me, for that reason i became psychological addictied. 
I have also experianced with all kinds of psychedelics like mushrooms, lsd, mdma and DMT ect.
I would not consider myself addicted to those substances as it was not something i would do on daily bases. 
I studied the effects of every psychedelic substance before take them, and I would be be extremly careful with set and settings while taking them. In a lot of ways these substances changed my perception of realitiy in good ways, i enjoy nature a whole lot more and it made me connect better with my emotions. 

Last year i started experimenting with cocaine and speed and it's profound effects it had on my mental focus.
That was very stupid. 
Suddently i could find anything interesting and I could work for 20 hours Straight with no mental fatigue. This lasted for around 4 months and I ended up with a really bad cocaine psychosis. 
I started freaking out and had some serious panic attacts and very real hallucinations. 
After that one bad cocaine experiance i stop using cocaine and speed all together. 
That same year late december is when i started to notice that I had some serious problems with attention, word recall and comprehention. I was still smoking weed, but at this point i was experiancing extreme paranoia i felt like i was being watched all the time and it was terrifying, so i had to quit pot to.
I wasn't feeling my self anymore I suddently discoverd that i had impaired speech and having  conversation's with People, family and friends was extremly mental exhausting. 
This resulted in deep depression, i was living with my girlfriend at the time, and I had serious problems communicating with her, i could barely speak and have joyful moments without crying i was literally a complete mess, I felt so sorry for her having to deal with me so i broke up with her. ""still not over her"" to this Day. 
I always enjoyed having deep conversations with friends sharing different points of view, ideas about our existence. And other interesting topics.
Now i have Nothing coming to my mind, its Just blank, I can't tell stories or share anything worth of value with anyone with more then 20 words.
My conversations are mostly responses and qustions rather then contributing to different topics of interest. 
I can barely comprehened what I am reading, and sometimes i have to read the same thing twice and it can be simple comments on social media. 
I find it difficult paying attention to my favorit Netflix series, its fun to watch but im not really following up on whats coming ""next"" i would have ideas about what would happen in the next episode of any series and predict what would happen in fine accuracy. Now that is all gone. 
I am now 6 months drug free but still struggle with brainfog word recall and comprehention. I am terrified that i Will never get back to normal comprehention, I literally feel brain dead.
Has anyone experianced anything similar? 
What are the chances of full recovery?",gyl742,25,1.0,3,2020-06-07 21:39:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/gyl742/word_recall_issues_and_poor_comprehention/,False,False,2020,6
14,Gut Endotoxin as a major source of brain fog,"Hey everyone, thought I'd share my experience on one thing that moved the needle on brain fog for me but gets lost in the media dogma of eating as much fiber as you can possibly stomach.

A little thing called endotoxin: 

 “Endotoxin or other material absorbed from intestinal bacteria contributes to a variety of autoimmune problems, including thyroiditis (Penhale and Young, 1988). Combining an indigestible fiber, such as raw carrot, with mild germicides, such as vinegar and coconut oil, can improve the hormonal environment, while reducing the immunological burden.” -Ray Peat

 “It takes a few days for the intestine to adjust to raw carrot, but the indigestible fiber is very protective for the intestine. Boiled bamboo shoots, which are also mostly indigestible, have a similar effect. These fibers prevent the reabsorption of estrogen in the intestine, and can shift the balance away from cortisol and estrogen, toward progesterone and thyroid, in just a few days of regular use. Oatmeal and potatoes do provide fiber, but they are good food for bacteria, and bacterial endotoxin is usually the basic problem causing hormone imbalance, by being a chronic burden for the liver, keeping it from storing enough sugar to process thyroid and the other hormones effectively.” 

\-Ray Peat

18,Starting to lose hope with my symptoms,"24m. Have recently posted about the following symptoms I've been experiencing for the past 3 maybe 4 years but they have gotten worse the past two.

MAIN SYMPTOMS:

- foggy thinking and thought processing. (Thoughts are really slow most of the time nothing is on my mind and I struggle to remember things. Like last year feels like a blur even yesterday I don't recall what I ate or what I did.)

- feel low on energy.

- highly irritable with people.

- ringing in ears and also hear it or feel it in my brain.

- stiff neck and shoulders (shoulders are rounded and neck is positioned more forward and I am correcting this with exercises. But my neck is super stiff and clicks when turning.)

- always clenching my jaw.

- all my wisdom teeth are rotten through (can't remove until the lockdown rules ease in UK. I thought this could be the cause as I've read people have rotten infected teeth REMOVED and boom the symptoms above relieve fairly fast.

- past few days I've been waking up feeling a strong numb sensention on my head around the back and I feel like I want to throw up and can't eat.

_______________

I have been to my doctor about this just before the UK lockdown went into motion. He said I have depression and gave me citalopram but this didn't help at all and I am healthy and have had blood tests come back healthy too.

I exercise 4 times a weak and eat healthy also... I'm losing hope as it's making more depressed as I feel like I won't be able to fix this... It's upsetting me and I'm starting not to care if I lose everything to this.

________________

I spoke to a therapist today as I am adopted and my adopted family think it could be under trauma from my past. But tbh it isn't affecting me and I've gotten on with my life just fine...

I went through a nasty break up at the end of 2018 which my ex said I'd changed and didn't seem myself so she left after 4 years. That did mess me up for a while but the symptoms were creeping in towards the end of that relationship.

The therapist said it could be the result of trauma I have burried up. But I have NO REASON to be unhappy with life I am so grateful for all I have around me!

Worried this could be something more serious medically going on?

19,Potential cause of brain fog,"The human brain has a feature where it will dull your senses upon a traumatic life event, this is why lots of people struggle to remember traumatic times in their life.  Regardless of what caused it, your brain can then learn to dull its senses regularly.

The good news, the brain can be trained to refocus, one way to do this is by using meditation and mindfulness.

A word of caution; for a long time, meditating made my brain fog much worse, by following a strict course my brain fog lifted dramatically.  I realised that when i was untrained at meditating, my default mode was to dull my mind, like being in a mild trance like state.  Learning the subtle differences between focus and attention was the game changer for me.

Unfortunately this is no quick fix, it could take a month or two of daily practice before noticing results.",h8rf8v,18,0.96,11,2020-06-14 10:30:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/h8rf8v/potential_cause_of_brain_fog/,False,False,2020,6

2,Might have just found the root cause of my 4+ years of chronic brain fog,"I suffered from chronic brain fog 4+ years, which really had devastating effect on my health, confidence, outlook and quality of life. How brain fog feels to me is: physically, immense tension all around my neck, shoulder, and head, and my brain feels ""turned off""-- always dark, I can remember things but its like I have no view-access to see the underlying workings. Almost all mental heavy-lifting's nearly impossible, like critical thinking, visualization, memorization, quick calculations, coming up with things to say, etc.

I tried everything from diet, NoFap, exercise, meditation, etc. and saw some improvement, but I never felt like I was hitting the root cause, until I randomly found a Korean article introducing a book and its contents. The title of the book is ""99% of Sick People Have Stiff Necks"", and I'd like to translate an anecdote the author, who is a doctor in Korea, quoted in the article:

""A woman in her 70's who have suffered brain fog for 30 years came to visit me. She was very smart, she went to a prestigious university, and walked on her path to be an academic. But during her master's degree, after experiencing mental abuse from her guidance professor, she started to experience brain fog. Whenever she tried to read, her brain became foggy and she couldn't grasp the words, and it would lead to a depressing downward spiral. The quality of her life went down drastically, and she had to live in pain for a long time.

Checking on her, she didn't exhibit anything peculiar, but her neck was severely tensed. It felt like if her neck can be fixed, everything will see improvement. After receiving treatment 20 times over time, she experienced clarity in her brain and cured her dried-eyes. ""If only I had known 30 years ago I wouldn't have suffered so long..."" she said regretfully.""

This resonated with me deeply, as I experienced a similar situation and exhibited similar symptoms. There was actually a series of blog articles showing from each chapter of the book, and from reading it, I came to conclude that the root cause of my brain fog is the immense tension around my neck, shoulders, and brain.

While keep researching, I found out about upper cervical chiropractics, and found Dr. Kevin Pecca and a video of him working with his patient and also his own testimonial on how he embarked on his journey ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NTZIoOWg\_s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NTZIoOWg_s)). I immediately searched and made an appointment to an upper cervical chiropractics office near me.

What I found during this research was that physical/mental/emotional traumas can cause severe stress that puts immense tension around your shoulders and neck, which disrupts the circulation and communication in the nerves running from your brain down the spines to the rest of your body, causing lack of blood-oxygen circulation in the brain and numbness to your body. And the former of these consequences is a main culprit for cognitive impairments, including brain fog. For couple days I really focused on stretching and massaging my neck, shoulders and head to remove tension and posture, and immediately feel better than I've been in a long time, although the brain fog is still there. I am really looking forward to get my upper cervical chiropractics checked, see what's wrong with me, and start working on it.

If you've been suffering from severe chronic brain fog and feel severe tension and heaviness in your head, neck, and shoulders, I really think working on them could be the cure to it all, and I am looking forward to find out. I will post updates in this reddit as I keep working on my brain fog and get better. Don't give up, keep looking for ways to get better, and the answer will come to you one day.",hpm02l,56,0.93,37,2020-07-12 01:30:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/hpm02l/might_have_just_found_the_root_cause_of_my_4/,False,False,2020,7
3,Neck misalignment's are a seriously overlooked cause of BrainFog.,"The medical term is an ""atlas subluxation"" and only a nucca certified or blair chiropractor can asses and correct this. I suspect that  good number of you have a neck misalignment due to bad posture and text neck. What is very scary is that most doctors cannot detect this and the first symptoms can be anything from brainfog, tiredness, mental disconnectedness, balance problems, asthma, allergies, headaches, nasua, panic attacks, eyepain. Many people spend years not knowing that they have this because symptoms of neck pain go asymptomatic for YEARS.

So before you load up on medication and supplements please consider visiting an upper cervical chiropractor for an asesment.

4,Guys.... I think I figured it all out....,"If you look at my previous post a few months back, I made a post about current things I had been trying in order to alleviate my brain fog. Please note, I've had this for 8 years, every test I have done - hormones, vitamins, MRIs of my brain, EEG, sleep study, etc. - has all come back within normality. No one has any idea what's causing my fog. My neurologist thought I was having migraines without the migraine. All sorts of random stuff was being thrown into the equation. But not a single doctor tested to see if I had any parasites, or chronic low grade infections. 

Now, if you're like me, you don't really have any GI issues - you purely have brain fog.  Your eye sight sucks, you're forgetful, you feel dull, the list goes on and on. 

I just found out that I have H Pylori. This causes a shit load of issues, including chronic fatigue and brain fog, among many other issues. The treatment for H Pylori? 2 weeks - 3 months on anti-biotics and other natural remedies. 

GO TO YOUR DOCTOR AND GET A GI MAP DONE. It's a stool test, they will test you for parasites and infections in your body. 

I haven't started treatment yet, but I've spoken to someone who had the SAME thing that I had dealt with, and they got rid of it after they figured out they had chronic low grade infections as well as H Pylori. 

IT'S WORTH LOOKING INTO. 

If your body is constantly fighting a ton of low grade infections and you're not showing symptoms, you're going to be in the same boat I am...

5,"Scary: Is your Time Perception also OFF, or is it just me? Brain Fog is killing me!","Hello,

I've been dealing with brain fog for about a year now. The only thing that was bothering me before was just my memory. The first problems with memory started after I had my surgery a couple of years ago. I was forgetting a lot but I kind of got used to it and didn't overthink even though I dealt with anxiety a couple of years ago. 

Recently I started worrying about this because it's getting worse and it's actually scary. Here's what I am experiencing: 

&#x200B;

1. **My memory is terrible**. I genuinely don't remember what happened yesterday. My brain just ignores most of the things I do, especially if it's a daily routine.
2. **My vision is not clear.** It feels blur all the time. It almost feels like I am not myself. It feels like an illusion. I cannot even explain it correctly.
3. **I cannot concentrate and focus** on anything. My focus is gone within 3 seconds. 
4. **My time perception is totally OFF**. To me, things that happened this morning feel like they happened a month ago and things that have happened a month ago feel like they happened just a few days ago. It's really messed up. I cannot enjoy anything anymore!

My biggest worry is actually the **time perception. I have no sense of time anymore!** It's really scary, it feels like I am living in a different life and not the one I used to have in the past. I cannot recall anything interesting within the last year. It's just foggy. I'm confused. 

I have done a lot of research about this. It could be because of sugar, it could be because of gut related problems, it could be because of Vitamin D deficiency. I am about to try literally everything. I am really motivated to get rid of this.

**Does anyone else experience this problem with time perception? Please let me know. And if you are, remember that you're not alone. Stay positive, eventually we will get out of this terrible state.**",hl1g08,26,0.97,43,2020-07-04 10:50:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/hl1g08/scary_is_your_time_perception_also_off_or_is_it/,False,False,2020,7

7,Stubborn Brain fog. Please help.,"I am 25\[F \]and have been dealing with brain fog for over a year now.

I had my blood tested last year - nothing abnormal except for low Vitamin D so I started taking supplements. I take multivitamins also.

I take 10 mg of Lexapro, but only started in October - brain fogginess started before then, so I do not believe it's the medication.

After seeing my doctor, she recommended I see a nutritionist as well as start exercising more.

I've done both, improved my diet and activity levels, but I feel no better. I sleep 8 hours a night at least, but am still tired throughout the day, sometimes I take a nap.

I generally feel like shit constantly. Yes, it gets worse with sugary food and/or caffeine. But I've been eating more lean meats, complex carbs, vegetables. Yesterday I went on a 6 mile hike. Shouldn't I be feeling loads better, or is there something I've missing?

The brain fog makes me feel like I'm in a haziness - like things aren't clear and crisp around me. It's crippling and I really am ready for it to go away so I can enjoy my 20s.

Today is particularly bad, and it got worse after I took a fish oil pill. I will say sometimes I spend hours sitting or laying down. Any thoughts appreciated.",hyjv41,26,1.0,28,2020-07-27 02:25:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/hyjv41/stubborn_brain_fog_please_help/,False,False,2020,7
8,Everything I know about my brain fog this far,"Hey, I'm 18 years old from germany and have been experiencing brain fog for over a year now.

**My lifestyle:**

I work out 3-4 times a week at the gym, I sleep about 7-9 hours each day, try to eat as healthy as possible with some fast food thrown in there for convenience, so diet isnt perfect, I could also do more cardio probably, probably still spend to much time in front of screens and seated.

**How it started:**

After messing around with acid a couple times I experienced a really terrifying trip. The days afterwards I was fine but after having trip-memories coming back in a dream I woke up confused, restless and anxious. I felt kind of anxious for the next 3 months but the anxiety slowly lifted and now Im 95% fine again. I don't think I was experiencing brain fog right after I started feeling anxious, but I was also smoking weed more frequently than I usually did, and the days after smoking it was normal for me to feel a bit of brain fog, but one time the brain fog just didn't lift and stuck around. I should also mention that a year before I took acid I started to not be able to enjoy smoking weed, for some reason instead of the possitive effects it had in the beginning it now made me more self conscious and a bit anxious and I would overthink and feel a bit disconnected from my friends.

**My symptoms:**

I have always been a bit forgetful and a bit easily distracted but brain fog didn't make those things THAT much worse. Instead the more prominent symptoms are

* \-just not being able to think quickly, sometimes not being able to process whats being said to me, not being able to handle simple tasks at work, my brain feels dull compared to the sharpness it used to have, mushy, everything feels like a blur
* \-not really being able to connect with people as well, feeling kind of numb, emotionless, even around close friends, feeling kind of awkward and self conscious and disconnected
* \-overanalyzing, getting into my own head, sometimes getting anxious about not feeling capable of doing something because I feel so fogged up

**Related Symptoms:**

* \-Forehead and face pressure, in extreme cases pressure on top of my head. This is the most extreme symptom I experience besides the brain fog and it adds to the feeling of haziness and feeling a bit disconnected. I usually experience this is combination with brain fog.
* \-Vision problems in combination with BF, eyes losing focus or not being able to focus at all, especially looking afar, everything has a bit of haziness to it, I feel like I have a bit of HPPD from the Acid I took, a lot more floaters in my vision than before the trip and bright lights now have tracers in dark rooms.
* \-Vertigo, dizziness, not sure about this one but it feels worse than usual in combination with BF
* \-Tinnitus, got this after a concert I went to right after my acid trip, I think its worse when Im already experiencing brainfog
* \-Tiredness, lower energy and motivation

All of these symptoms usually get worse or better together, like they are all related. The intensity of symptoms varies throughout the day, some days I barely feel any symptoms, others I feel them more intensely for a couple days

&#x200B;

**Seemingly non-related symptoms**

* \-issues with digestions for years, its rare for me to have a perfect digestion, usually my stool is too soft/""fluid"", sometimes I get intense diarrhea  and stomach cramps for 1-2 days, but this barely happens anymore, like 2-3 years ago I used to get this about once a month, a lot of people in my family have problems with allergies to certain foods, especially my dad
* \-Hazy/Blurry vision caused by reading, goes away about half an hour after I stop reading
* \-Prone to joint pains, easily get lower back pain
* \-sometimes get chest pain, back pain, neck pain that feels more like a tightness in my upper body that I mostly feel when breathing, comes in waves. I feel like this could be related to maybe heartburn or a sore back from working out, but maybe theres some deeper issues
* \-never really had much of a libido in my life, hope kicking porn will improve this
* \-don't feel very high energy in general
* \-used to deal with depression, but the anxiety I got from the trip kind of made me reconsider my life and I grew a lot as a person the last few years, the only thing I sometimes feel depressed about nowadays is my brainfog :/
* \-started feeling a bit of shortness of breath/lower lung capactiy about 2 months ago, dont think its corona, sometimes get random aches in the lung/heart area or lower abdomen
* \-started feeling more dizzy when standing up or while working out a few months ago

**Things that make my symptoms worse:**

* \-I feel like stressful situations might make it worse, not sure, but when there is a situation where I am a bit nervous about doing something or stressful social situations the brain fog is almost always there and makes it worse, in the beginning I thought it might just be related to anxiety, but often I even feel brainfog when relaxing at home while not under any stress
* \-Being hungover definitely makes it much worse, as does drinking to frequently, or smoking weed
* \-tracked digestion/quality of food/brain fog together for a while but not long enough to come to a conclusion, but eating fast food or drinking soda aswell as having issues with digestion in the morning might be an indicator of more intense brain fog later in the day
* \-probably lack of sleep
* \-intense workouts with compound lifts, they also cause a bit of dizziness, and the exhaustion kind of adds to my brain fog

**Things that I have gotten checked already:**

* \-stool (not sure what exactly but they checked for, but they didn't find anything out of the ordinary)
* \-male hormones (fine)
* \-Thyroid (fine)
* \-EBV (never had it)
* \-kidneys (fine)
* \-Lyme (tested positive, but they said that the infection had happened a while ago and that it wouldn't be related to my symptoms)
* \-my doctor tested me for some other stuff im not sure about, the only thing that was a little below the normal range were leukocytes (they also tested granulocytes, erythrocytes, cholesterol, etc, nothing came back out of the ordinary)

**What I plan on doing next:**

* \-seeing an eye specialist for possible vision problems and eye strain
* \-getting a scan of my head that includes the sinuses to check for something like chronic sinusitis (also because of my head pressure)
* \-seeing a neurologist, my doctor also told me to consider maybe getting checked for ADHD
* \-maybe seeing someone for my tinnitus, also have occasional issues with ear pressure
* Trying an elimination diet, cutting out gluten (my father has quite a lot of problems with all kinds of foods, he is familiar with brain fog, he says in his case its caused by eating the wrong things)

&#x200B;

I made this post to hopefully get new input from you guys on my situation, suggestions as to what else to test for and things I should consider. I really feel like brain fog is holding my back in the prime of my life, I need a clear head to get what I want out of life and I really don't want to have to deal with brain fog for much longer. The last few months I've learned to live with it more and more, but I don't know if I would be able to accept it for the rest of my life. Very thankful that this community actually exists and that there are people out there that can relate

12,Brain fog has ruined my ability to think and I don't know how to fix it. Advise would be very useful.,"I haven't done anything in years (about 4 years). Back in high school I was having some problems with stress and depression. This made me want to say home and do absolutely nothing. For 2 years I was spending a couple of months in school, followed by a couple of months out, followed by me eventually dropping out. When I was in school I could multitask unbelievably well and I would regularly get in trouble for ""not paying attention"" even though I could remember every word of what the teachers were saying even days later. I didn't have to study because of this. I could to equations in my head faster than I could write them out, all while thinking about other things entirely. I distinctly remember listening to *1984* on audio book while reading and doing a book report for English. I also played 2 instruments (which i can barely play anymore). The 2 or so years I've been doing nothing. Playing video games, watching movies, and listening to music. I don't work out, I only eat junk food, my sleep schedule is completely nonsensical, I don't leave my house for months at a time, I go months without talking to my friends (unintentionally). I can't do math anymore because I constantly miss read things, miss steps, and forget how to do things. I had a brief period where i felt slightly better and told my friends I wanted to get into systems engineer and go to college despite the fact I haven't done anything in over 4 years. They ask me why I stopped, or if I'm still going to go ahead with it, but the truth is I can't. I often times say things that don't make sense because I literally forget what I was saying mid sentence and my brain just fills in something random. I struggle to even remember precisely what I did yesterday. I've been training my touch typing ability and trying to teach myself to code in an attempt to try to challenge myself but I just keep making the same mistakes over and over again. I never get angry normally, but I'm just so frustrated by not being able to do things that used to be so easy for me. Even my vocabulary is noticeably worse even to me. I have trouble focusing on things visually as well, like my eyes won't focus. All of this before information is properly explain how bad it is, as well as how frustrating it is. For a long time i figured it would just go away, or it was just what being in your 20's was like but I don't think that's the case anymore. I don't know if it's my diet, some undiagnosed disease, genetics, mental health, or lack of doing anything for such a long time, but whatever it is, it's driving me crazy. It's like my brain is running on a ssd with no cache. Sorry if this is hard to read for obvious reasons. Any help would be great, or even just that you are in a similar situation.

0,Brainfog cure after 8 months of fog,"Hi all,

Just posting this to hopefully help someone out there. One person saved from this horrible fog would be worth it. 

I have had brain fog since January this year. It all started when I moved out of home. I put it down to stress and anxiety and then when it didn’t clear I started looking into other causes. 

Just yesterday I found a post years ago saying their memory foam mattress was contributing to their brain fog. Suddenly the cogs started moving in my head. Keeping in mind I also had a memory foam pillow which upon taking the cover off, found it had mould which is also a common cause of brain fog. 

Anyway the mattress I was using was 10 years old and a different one from the one I slept on at home. Last night I switched the mattress to my original one from home and low and behold this morning I woke up a new person. I almost couldn’t believe it. After elimination diets, drs visits, accepting it was anxiety and I’d have to live with it I couldn’t believe it had cured me. 

I reckon within a week I should be back to normal as I’m still slightly foggy, but I would say I’m an 8/10 now vs being a 2/10.

PLEASE look into your bed/ mattress quality. If it’s old, or shitty, UPGRADE. Get yourself a good quality pillow and mattress. It’s something you deserve to have, considering how important sleep is and how often we are in bed/sleeping. 

All the best everyone. This forum has helped me so much not feel alone.",ijngfm,66,0.98,28,2020-08-30 23:54:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/ijngfm/brainfog_cure_after_8_months_of_fog/,False,False,2020,8

2,Living on autopilot,"Hey,
are you also having the feeling of living on autopilot?
It is like I am doing everything subconciously, cant focus on my tasks and just being empty in my head. 

I still remember how I could see things I did from a different point of view, so I could think of what I am doing and that helped me to make decisions and do the right things.

But this has absolutely gone. It is like I am just living without thinking. I do a lot of mistakes when I get different tasks, because I can‘t cope with different situations as my thinking is completely blocked. 

There are maybe 1 or 2 days in the month where I feel a little bit better, but I dont really feel alive anymore.

I also see how my feelings are completely flattened. In the past I always had some sort of feelings when I am at a specific place for example. Nowadays I dont even feel fear or embarrassement anymore. I just do things because I know I cant think about them, which sometimes lead to embarrassing situations. Yet I dont really care. This was absolutely different in my past. I always had fear of this situations.

But even fear and anxiety I just feel subconciously. I notice that they are there in some situations. But it doesnt really affect me in my thinking. Yet when I feel that I am anxious (as my body gets tensed) everything gets even worse.

I dont know....

In the last days Psoriasis got me really hard again. I also have the problem that I am fapping too much and cant resist.

Maybe those things are the cause for my situation. Or my situation causes me to have Psoriasis and to fap.

I dont know....

The overconsumption of news, constant anxiety of being compared to my peers, scrolling endlessly for hours instead of living real life eventually caused my brain to dull out. I deleted everything for a year now and my focus is so much better. I’m no longer distracted by my phone nor depressed or fuzzy headed due to trying to keep up with societal pressures.",ii93ns,41,0.99,6,2020-08-28 15:27:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/ii93ns/quitting_social_media_and_excess_internet_usage/,False,False,2020,8

5,Can brain fog cause significant reduction in cognitive abilities?,"So I'm suffering extreme brain fog and have been for a few months  now. By far the worst I've ever experienced in my life. I'm getting all the standard stuff; confusion, anxiety, depression, insomnia, lack of focus, difficulty finding words. However it also legitimately feels like my IQ has been slashed in half. I don't know if this is a product of the lack of clarity but my cognitive abilities are just screwed up across the board and its extremely concerning.

For reference, I've been gaming a lot in quarantine to pass the time. One of the games I'm playing a lot recently is League of Legends. For those that don't know about this game its extremely demanding in terms of focus, reaction speed, and critical thinking. I used to be real good at this game, like top 10% good. Now I'm pretty bad and this is one of the things (out of many) that's making it apparent my brain isn't functioning normally.


Is this normal for brain fog? I appreciate any input greatly, thank you.",iabwcz,25,0.95,5,2020-08-15 17:50:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/iabwcz/can_brain_fog_cause_significant_reduction_in/,False,False,2020,8
6,"NoFap did it for me, no more Brain Fog...","Hi guys, i just wanted to let you know that you will find the reason for your brain fog, and you will beat it.

I have been dealing with this shit for such a long time, it destroyed my life. I got anxious and depressed. My grades started falling off. And i was once a bright intelligent guy who used to learn stuff pretty quick.

Then the brain fog came and it hindered me so much. I hated even waking up, didn't want to really live because of it. I tried everything from diets to doctor visits to allergies and nothing helped me. At one point i thought I had MS. 

But then i found out about NoFap, and boy did that do the trick in my case. Right now, i can say that i am 100% me again. Colors are once more bright. I love waking up and just getting out of bed fully rested once again. My energy is through the roof, i am working out twice a day. I can also finally have normal conversations without stuttering and trying to remember the right word. 

Now i even like studying, because i can actually do it without much trying.

Again, i want you to know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, i just urge you to not give up and go for it. You will find your cure.

Once again, this worked for me, im not saying it will work for everyone.

Thank you for the support everyone!!!

9,I think I found the direct cause of my fog.,"When I'm feeling really foggy and can't focus, I noticed that both of my eyes don't make any saccadic movements. On the days that I feel okay and a bit functional then one eye makes saccadic movements. On the days where I'm feeling normal, both of my eyes make saccadic movements. 

You can easily test this by trying to look somewhere and then notice how your eyes move, if they stay fixed at a specific point and don't jump around scanning the scene then they aren't making saccadic movements. 

I've had TMD for a while now and I think this might be a side effect of that, as I can sometimes move or message my jaw in a certain way and my eyes would function normally and the fog goes away. I also should mention that the muscles on the side that's not functional feel tight, so it might be that my TMJ is affecting a nerve that controls the muscles and it's making eye movements really difficult.",i2y9vk,23,1.0,9,2020-08-03 14:45:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/i2y9vk/i_think_i_found_the_direct_cause_of_my_fog/,False,False,2020,8

I’ve had a sleep study, full blood panel, cut out gluten, sugar and all processed foods, quit caffeine, I even did nofap for 2 months straight... nothing helped. Then I went on vacation for a month and it disappeared until a few weeks after I returned.

At this point I realized it’s either environmental or stress related. After seeing a facebook post from a friend who suffered health and mental issues from a mold toxicity problem, I decided to have my house tested.

The acceptable levels are less than 400 ppm.

My basement: 40,000 ppm.

My bedroom: 4,500 ppm.

These levels are extremely high and can definitely trigger brain fog.

Sometimes when I’m in a meaningful conversation, my brain just shuts down or refuses to process what is being said. I walk away from the conversation feeling like I understood nothing and it’s honestly so frustrating. 

I work at a fast-paced PR agency and sometimes, my brain shuts down in the middle of work - I’m not sure if it’s cause there are just wayyyy too many things going on and my brain is just . But it’s gets stressful since I can’t do anything productive with my brain at a standstill and I end up procrastinating and staying up till the late AM just to finish my day’s work.

I’m forgetting everything and it’s so scary. It’s as if the wires in my brain are ripped apart. All the switches are off and nothing is working correctly. Typing this has taken me so long because I can barely put my thoughts into sentences. It’s taken so much energy. Tonight I’ve given up, the fog is too thick. I’ve lost myself in the fog.

8,Fog for 2-3 days after drinking,"Hi everyone, 

Firstly, great sub, I’ve been searching for an answer to what I’m suffering for years now!

My brain fog comes on for two or three days after binge drinking. I know the answer is: “don’t drink” but I won’t lie, I really enjoy it. It also gives me relief from low level residual fog. 

The pattern of my fog is:

Friday night: binge drink; 
Saturday: acute physical hangover; 
Sunday: depressed mood, anxiety; 
Monday, Tuesday, sometimes Wednesday: terrible brain fog, can’t remember things I read, lost for words, anxiety, worry, feeling of apathy;  
Thursday: feeling better, fog has lifted;  
Friday night: binge drink...

Would be interested in hearing if anyone follows this pattern, or discovered methods to alleviate it (other than stopping drinking!)

9,Brainfog linked to eyes? Blurry vision and loss of focus,"Physical symptoms of my brainfog include Forehead pressure, blurry/fuzzy vision, eyes not being able to focus/zoning out often, bit of dizziness.

It started a month after a bad acid trip, I have very mild symptoms of HPPD I think, lots of floaters, sometimes singular small shining points of light/sparks appearing in my vision for a split second before I can focus on them they disappear, blue field entoptic phenomenon very noticable when looking into the sky. Don't really experience visual snow, but instead a slight effect of rain, so when I look somewhere and my eyes lose focus it will look light very thin rain, very prominent when looking at striped backgrounds. 

What makes me think that this could be related to my brainfog is that when I get outside to take a walk in nature and am not looking at things up close my brainfog seems to decrease quite a bit, but then I get back home and look at screens or books up close and after 10 minutes my forehead pressure starts again and my vision becomes bit fuzzy and my eyes struggle to focus.

I've been spending too much time in front of screens for the last couple of years, but brainfog only started to appear a bit over a year ago. I have an appointment with a doctor to get my eyes checked, previous vision test was 2 months ago, I struggled a tiny bit, but was able to see everything they tested me for more or less clearly.",ixln2a,21,0.97,10,2020-09-22 11:35:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/ixln2a/brainfog_linked_to_eyes_blurry_vision_and_loss_of/,False,False,2020,9

13,Mental Health,"   This was a comment from a different post on this sub that I wrote, but I think it really should become its own post. I'm starting to feel better, but I do have a lot of experience in my life with poor mental health, and I think if you're struggling with depression, anxiety, and/or stress - you should read this in its entirety. **NOTE** I am not a medical proffessional and this is not a cure all or anything, just tips from what I've learned. 

If you don't already do so, I suggest going to see a therapist and a psychiatrist (if the psychiatrist is also a therapist that's a big win-win). If you know any good coping mechanisms, use them! 

You describe like being in a mental hospital, but they are actually good places (private ones anyway). When I was admitted to one I learned all sorts of ways to cope with my depression; I didn't quite focus on anything about anxiety. I'm dealing with a lot of health anxiety as a result of the fog, making me hyperanalyze every ache, pain and symptom and attempting to associate it with my fog - in an effort to find the cause. TBH, 

Start eating better (cut out your processed foods; of course youll have little cheat meals here and there, but seriously, eat a shit ton of fruits, vegetables, and nuts (if you can). Exercise everyday (although I'm the biggest hypocrite when it comes to this); even if it's a brisk walk for 30 minutes a day, get your heart pumping 30-60 minutes a day, it'll really help! The best I've ever felt in my life was after basic training - I was fed right, and I literally exercised 24/7. 

If you're under a lot of stress, and you have depression and anxiety, it will (probably already has) turn into a perpetual feedback loop making you worse and worse. Meditate (not the zen shit, just try to do mindfulness) and stuff. **MAKE TIME FOR YOURSELF YOU BAFOON!** A lot of folks don't understand the importance of taking time to take care of yourself - good hygiene, eat well, exercise - but the most important thing is take some time out of the day to do the things you most enjoy. I know all too well that when you have depression you come to think that everything that you once loved to do no longer interests you anymore - **DO THEM ANYWAY I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH** when it comes to depression - that is the main thing that I learned in my time at a mental hospital. Listen to your favorite (or past favorite) jams. Don't passively listen to the music either - put in your earbuds, listen to the music fuckin jam out - get up and dance! Actively listening to music or even a podcast really helps me out, and puts my mind off of whatever I'm anxious or depressed about. 

If you're a reader I HIGHLY SUGGEST 'Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers' by Robert Sapolsky - because it will literally (in very explicit detail) explain how stress, depression, and anxiety REALLY fuck you up, and most importantly - how to manage it. 

If the anxiety and/or depression is really bad **DO NOT SELF MEDICATE WITH DRUGS AND BOOZE** - it will ALWAYS make it worse. From a sufferer of fucking god awful mental health to another: drugs are really good at distracting you from those thoughts that have made life become an agonizing chore, but just know that it will, fuck you up mentally (and physically, too) - especially with addiction. However, when it gets real bad - I do pop 4mg of Valium (prescribed), and it stops the process in its tracks but you should never try to rely on it - its like breaking your leg and just using a wheelchair forever, while every night you keep smashing the broken leg with a brick.

Just always remember to have self-affirmations to yourself. The constant ruminations of negative thoughts that you do when you're depressed and anxious fuck up your head. You need to counteract that by just telling yourself, multiple times a day: 'I will get better', 'this is only temporary', and whatever is the opposite of what your brain keeps saying to itself. Even if it isn't true, fake it till you make it - it actually does work. Hell, even force yourself to smile, even when there's no reason or want to do so throughout the day. 

All in all, I hope you get better. I've almost ended my life over depression, and never thought the Mental Health grim reaper would return with anxiety and brain fog. But I never regret getting help (even though half the time it was against my will). I will always be grateful that I never died that day, or any other day I tried. I will always be glad that I am alive today, because even though I still suffer, we must suffer to understand happiness. I thought my suffering was over, but it isn't. and to be frank, I say that I would go right back to it if it meant the fog was gone, and I was back to the brilliant man I once was, but its not true. I'm getting better and I feel pretty good. You have to fight and want to fight, instead of worrying (which is hard to do, trust me, I know). Losing my brain was my biggest fear, because it was all I had going for me (except maybe my body somewhat) But y'all need to stay strong.  
TL;DR - Eat less processed shit, replace with fruits, veggies, and nuts. Exercise. Go to therapy and psychiatrists. Do what you love/used to love. Listen to music. Don't fucking self medicate with drugs (It took me 5 years to get sober from doing literally everything, even after suicide attempts, mental hospitalizations, etc.) Read the book 'Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers', and take care of yourself.

1,SOS- Is Anyone's BrainFog this Severe?,"**Symptoms started 4 months ago and include:**

* Daily tension headache in front part of skull for 4 months 
* Lost my internal monologue/thought process (poverty of thought, earworms only)
   * Can't develop or understand complex/abstract thoughts or ideas anymore. I look back at old journal entries from just a few months ago and my current brain is incapable of coming up with those ideas/advanced thoughts. No longer can believe in anything spiritual, like my 3rd eye is sealed shut with concrete.
   * The part of my brain that used to develop creative ideas is shut off completely
   * Impaired judgment, loss of opinions and critical thinking skills
   * Can't plan, reason, contemplate or think ahead 
   * Loss of previous learned knowledge/skills
   * Feels like I lost 20 IQ points, my executive functioning took a huge hit 
* Poor comprehension (conversations, movies, books, TV shows, etc). It takes me much longer to register what other people are saying, and sometimes my brain just can't fathom it. 
* Poverty of speech, poor verbal recall. Most words have escaped my once profuse vocabulary, I've forgotten the existence of most of them, except the ones used to describe my current condition. 
   * Can't sustain conversations or contribute anything meaningful anymore because my mind is always blank. Just basic emotional responses
   * Social isolation- I started avoiding talking to friends and family because it takes so much energy just to figure out how to reply to a text message without sounding basic asf. I feel stupid and boring since the onset of these symptoms and am really insecure about it
* Sentence structure/grammar/spelling/typing speed significantly worse
* Horrible short term memory (literally forgetting things/conversations seconds afterward)
* Loss of personality/self, dissociation 
   * Apathy towards everything I was once passionate about 
   * Anhedonia- no pleasure, always suicidal
   * Avolition- no motivation to do anything but the bare minimum
   * Struggle to take care of basic needs (working out, personal hygiene, haven't left the house in days)
   * Reduced bodily coordination 
* Sound/light sensitivity. Music was once my life and no longer makes me feel good
* Emotionally numb
   * Hard to cry even though I feel constantly suicidal  
   * Sometimes smile/laugh when discussing sad topics (doesn't reflect my actual feelings)
   * No fear response (can no longer feel the physical effects of anxiety. When I drive I've become more reckless because I'm numb and can't feel fear) 

**Who I was before the onset:** This condition has transformed me into the opposite of who I was just 4 months ago-- a highly artistic, creative, passionate, physically active, intelligent, wise, charismatic, spiritual, and social individual. I was confident, had a strong sense of self, a large social circle, and a promising trajectory as a multidisciplinary artist and singer-songwriter. Now I socially isolate and obsessively research my condition in a catatonic state in bed, unable to bring myself to do anything else. I hate who I've suddenly become, it's not me. Ironically, my bachelor's is in communications (prior to this it was my greatest strength aside from my artistic capabilities) and now I struggle to communicate, let alone think. This is a skill we all need to survive, especially in a society that rewards extroverted behavior. 

**Factors leading to onset:** 2019-2020 has been the darkest stage of my life. My indulgence in weed increased to daily use to minimize symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and OCD. But my medicine became my poison as my usage continued to increase and I developed a psychological dependency along with increased paranoia, anxiety, and pattern recognition/delusions. I had a 'spiritual awakening' or so I thought- but now in retrospect, it is likely that I had psychotic symptoms and a weed-induced psychosis. I also had a period of manic creativity- I felt like a genius because I was constantly cranking out poetry, ideas, and song lyrics on a daily basis. Over the summer, I drove across the country to visit a dying family member and stopped smoking (I've smoked about 4 times since, and basically just quit). On the way back I developed unbearable anxiety as I was forced to confront uncomfortable truths I had previously escaped from with weed. When I came home, I had a 2 week panic episode- more anxiety than I've ever felt in my life. I tossed and turned throughout the night and could never relax, I felt horrible. Then one day I woke up, and my brain shut off- and I haven't been the same since. At first I could hardly speak and my mind went blank. Cue the symptoms mentioned above \^\^

**Medical Prognosis:** Since the onset of my cognitive deficits, I have spoken to therapists, doctors, and psychiatrists. None of them knew me before the onset. I have received different speculations from them (drug-induced psychosis with bipolar, depression/anxiety). My therapist wants me to get an evaluation from an Early Intervention Bipolar/Schizophrenia/Psychotic Disorder program, I'm just waiting on the referral. I have been prescribed Wellbutrin, but have not taken it yet. I am afraid because many antidepressants/antipsychotics worsen cognition. I received an MRI which came back clear (many often do despite severe psychiatric/neurological problems). I am contemplating buying Sarcosine. I take Gingko Biloba, fish oil, and a custom Chinese herbal formula, with no noticeable results. 

\*\*Please note: I have obsessively (I have obsessive compulsive tendencies) researched my condition for the past 4 months and repeated this story to many healthcare professionals and close friends, hence my ability to articulate it. My symptoms are much more obvious in person. It also took me a long time to write this. I am very scared. I worked my ass off to receive my education, and my parents worked hard asf to help fund it. I feel like everything/all the education I worked so hard for is gone.  My personality gone. My career prospects gone because I lost my artistic and intellectual skills and mental abilities. I feel disabled, and I don't know how I will ever be self sufficient in the future. I constantly make dumb decisions and mistakes nowadays, when I used to be cautious and calculated. Friends and family keep insisting that I will ""recover,"" but if I have the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, that's a lie because it's a degenerative disease. I have been suicidal for the last 4 months because I'm mourning myself and my previous life, which was beyond blessed. Any suggestions or guidance is greatly appreciated.

2,Think the cause is my Neck!!!,"24m.

Hi guys so I've posted on here in the past about the following symptoms:

- Neck and back stiffness, esp in the shoulder blades. Ive had this tightness inbetween my should blades in my teens which is worrying for me.

- Tightness and headaches around the base of my skull

- Cracking sounds when rotating my neck

- Ringing in ears which gets worse when I move my neck back (Tinnitus)

- Dizziness and fainting. Espically when standing up I almost black out and don't recall what happened.

- Lower back pain also

- Brainfog

- Spaced out and feeling drunk like im in a dream always zoning out

- Dry mouth

- Fight or flight mode constantly on causing extreme anxiety and stress making me very irritable and angry

- Difficulty sleeping and grinding my teeth causing my jaw to be stiff in the mornings

- Extreme fatigue all of the time - have very little energy and try to distribute it carefully throughout the day without getting more stressed

- Sweating constantly even when cold - esp on my hands

I've been to the doctors for the past 2 years to figure out the cause. He put me on SSRIs. Which eased anxiety but all the other symptoms slowly got worse. 

Had blood tests and all the usual thyroid test and hormones. Everything was healthy. 

I broke down and felt suicidal early Sept. I was losing hope... until I did something odd.... I stretched my neck in the morning upon waking up and pushed my chin in like a chin tuck and my tinnitus got so loud and I felt dizzy and off balance and my symptoms felt so much worse.

So I was like what!!! This must be my neck. So I did a ton of research into forward neck position and neck misalignment. And so I went to the chiropractor and had an xray.

Turned out my neck is so straight and my head is very forward. Aka the nerd neck. She explained this puts tension on the nerves and blood supply leading into the brain! Which causes most if not all the symptoms I listed above.

She said some of the C4 C5 and another few I can't remember. Were worn down, like this could have been from an injury or concussion from a younger age. And it snapped in my head I had a really bad head injury when I was a kid around 12 on holiday. 

I was in bed for 2 days in so much pain and put on pain killers. And after that nothings been the same for me. Guess things have just slowly gotten worse with the body growing and being a heavy gamer and videographer. 

My job is sitting at a desk but in my old job as a camera man I was shrugged over for years looking down at a camera screen most of my days. This is when the symptoms started getting increasingly worse!

I've always been very hunched over and forward shouldered growing up being 6ft 2 inches tall, which doesn't help the situation either. So I think over time my posture and neck just got out of alignment over the years. 

But guys it's getting so bad for me I feel so sick and ill. 

Resulting in choking off blood supply and information to my brain. 

Here's some links for you guys if you relate to my symptoms and situation:

Really hope this helps someone out there struggling with the same thing! As I'd almost lost hope as you feel so alone fighting against it. 

But I've only had 3 adjustments. She said it will feel worse before it gets better moving things back into the correct place! But I'm hoping this will solve it for me.",jbrje0,56,0.98,54,2020-10-15 17:00:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/jbrje0/think_the_cause_is_my_neck/,False,False,2020,10
3,BRAIN FOG = INFLAMMATION,"When I get a brain fog ""flare,"" my symptoms cause me feel almost unconscious even though I'm awake, severe fatigue, slurred and jumbled speech, thyroid pressure/pain, and repetitive yawning. With these symptoms, I find it difficult to speak/communicate; I find myself slurring my speech, mixing words up, feeling blank and removed, staring off, not feeling present to even hold a simple conversation, and acute onset of repetitive/excessive yawning that I can’t stop. I experience these debilitating symptoms most of the day, every day. When I take ibuprofen, however, my symptoms and speech impairments are temporarily alleviated. I’ve struggled with these symptoms most of my life but didn’t discover until 2019 that these pathological symptoms have a direct correlation to anti-inflammatories. (I discovered ibuprofen helps my symptoms accidentally in 2019 when I took ibuprofen to help relieve my thyroid pain and noticed my brain fog symptoms were relieved as well.) Due to this, I believe that the pathophysiology of brain fog symptoms is due to inflammation.

My symptoms haven't changed with or without levothyroxine and my symptoms haven’t changed even when I was on the AIP diet for a while (and I also tried supplements for a while: selenium, turmeric/curcumin, multivitamins, prebiotics, probiotics, and omega-3s, which didn’t help me either). I've always had these brain fog issues, even when my TSH, T3, and T4 are normal. Consequently, this leads me to feel confident that this is autoimmune/inflammatory based, especially when my symptoms are only temporarily relieved by ibuprofen.   

As of July 2020, I had a brain MRI done and it came back as “normal,” and ANA, ESR, CRP labs, which were deemed “normal” as well. I do have abnormal autoimmune inflammatory biomarkers, i.e. anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies, for which I’ve always tested positive/abnormally high. I'm curious if anyone else with brain fog has tested for these antibodies?

My rough interpretation of the pathophysiology that's going on is diagnosis E06.3: anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies = (autoimmune) lymphocytes --> high/abnormal (autoimmune) lymphocytes = autoimmune disease --> treatment of autoimmune disease = methotrexate or corticosteroids.

Since ibuprofen has been the only thing that has given me temporary relief, I was wondering about trying a short-term immunosuppressant to help put my symptoms in remission. I've asked my PCP and the endocrinology office if I would be able to try an immunosuppressant (ie methotrexate or corticosteroid) to relieve my symptoms - they completely refused that as a possible treatment. 

According to the published article “A clinical approach to diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis”: Steroid-responsive encephalopathy must have detectable levels of antithyroid antibodies in the body and the diagnosis can be made when all 6 of the following criteria have been met:

1. Encephalopathy with seizures, myoclonus, hallucinations, or stroke-like episodes 
*Do my speech/neuro symptoms fulfill this category?

2. Subclinical or mild overt thyroid disease (usually hypothyroidism).
*I do have this

3. Normal brain MRI or with non-specific abnormalities.
*I do have this (normal MRI)

4. Presence of serum thyroid (thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin) antibodies.
*I do have these

5. Absence of well-characterized neuronal antibodies in serum and CSF.
*I haven’t been tested for this yet

6. Reasonable exclusion of alternative causes

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5066574/)

What is your opinion of short-term methotrexate or corticosteroid treatment as being viable solutions for mitigation of brain fog?

7,Solidarity for my fellow young folks with brain fog,"I’m 22 and have had brain fog for the past 5ish years. It’s been getting progressively worse each year (along with a myriad of other health problems: chronic pain, depression, anxiety, fatigue, etc.). I’ve seen quite a few people in this subreddit in their late teens and early 20s and...yeah I just wanted to say that I really, really relate with you all. It’s so difficult experiencing this shit and having people (including doctors in my experience) tell you that you’re “too young” to have these health problems. The truth is, as we all well know, these problems can affect people of ALL ages. There’s no such thing as being too young to be unhealthy. Young people can and do get sick. 
Unfortunately, like a lot of you, I haven’t found any reprieve over the years. Here’s to hoping that the future will hold some answers. Try not to give up and don’t stop advocating for yourself!

8,My Brain Fog Was Caused By Anxiety!,"Hello all of my foggy friends! I recently have made a breakthrough discovery in my journey with brain fog... IT'S ALL IN MY HEAD! 

I know this sounds cliche, and everybody's brain fog is different, but I have been feeling SO MUCH BETTER the past few weeks after struggling with mild brain fog for a few years and SEVERE brain fog for the past 11 months. 

I, like most of you, had tried everything I could to pinpoint why I was feeling the way that I was. I was losing sleep stressing about it, wondering if I would feel this way forever. Brain fog consumed me and it was the first thing I thought about when I woke up and the last thing I thought about before I went to sleep. Finally, I decided in June 2020 to seek out a therapist to talk to about my anxiety surrounding my brain fog. 

The beginning wasn't easy, I felt like I was stumbling over my words and couldnt get the point across, but I can happily say after 5 months of regular therapy sessions, my head feels much clearer and I have a much better understanding as to what MY brain fog is being caused by. 

I was so wrapped up in worrying about why I felt so foggy that it never dawned on me that I was the one mentally and physically exhausting my brain, which only caused the fog to worsen. 

Managing my anxiety has been an enormous step in recovering from this awful ailment. And I encourage anybody who has yet to try therapy to give it a shot. It took about 3 months of therapy once a week for me to start feeling better, but everybody is different! 

It's frustrating. Trust me, I understand. However letting brain fog consume your thoughts only makes it worse (at least it did for me). Talking it out could really help and I wish somebody suggested therapy sooner. I have tried different vitamins, tea's, microdosing on shrooms, supplements, diets, gone to see an ENT doctor because I thought my sinuses were clogged, etc... the best place to start is with your own mind! 

**disclaimer** everybody is different, what gave me relief may not work for you, but even still I think therapy is something that will greatly benefit everybody in one way or another, even if it doesnt ""cure"" your brain fog. I still have foggy days and it's always kind of there in the back of my mind, but it no longer seems to impair my everyday life and invade my thoughts, which is great progress :)",jb2uro,35,0.94,18,2020-10-14 15:30:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/jb2uro/my_brain_fog_was_caused_by_anxiety/,False,False,2020,10

Been suffering with brain fog/headaches/difficulty concentrating for as long as I can remember.

Visited multiple neurologists, EMT, general doctors. Tried acupuncture, chiropractors, meditation, pretty much everything possible, but it always feels like it's there. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, I randomly had an episode where it felt like one of my ears popped like after swimming and I heard a hissing/pressurizing sound. and BOOM my head felt 100% clear. I wasn't doing anything, just sitting down.

&#x200B;

Sadly this lasted only for 1-2 hours and then came back, but first and only time my fog cleared up.

10,You’re not crazy. Trust me. 10year brain fog veteran here.,"Idk where to begin my story. I guess I should start by saying, first and foremost you guys will all be fine. I want to help you guys. I believe everything you feel, everything you’re perceiving. I believe there is still an old You waiting outside the fog. 

My journey started 10 years ago. I smoked weed for the first time ever and the next day I still felt “high.” But I wasn’t high anymore but it felt like it. Next day came. Same thing. And this went on for about a month or so. I went to the doctor because I couldn’t take it anymore. My world was not the same world I was in before I hit the blunt. And yea I know, sounds stupid. But that’s was me dealing with it in high school. So I went to get checked out and like many of yous, I was written off. Depression, drug abuse, crazy. All those I had no history of at the time. A week later after my doctor visit. I was back to normal. 

Continued my life for 3 years and it was back. And it hits you like a ton of bricks. All of a sudden. I’m out of high school now and working. Now I’m trying to deal with work and customers while trying to figure out what the fuck was happening with me. I couldn’t feel anything, I couldn’t understand anything. Conversations were confusing. It’s like I was dyslexic with the words in my head. What I head became a puzzle. Time was passing through me really fast. 1 min was almost an actual hour. I couldn’t hear things around me correctly. My body was literally freaking out. I was hopeless. My job was on the line here. So here I go again back to another doc. This time we made progress. He found a mass in my brain but couldn’t connect my symptoms to it. So he said we’ll keep an eye on it every year to see if it grows. So a few days after that I was back to normal. Everything was everything again. 

Might I add my fog is on and off. With the finding of my tumor/mass. Doctor also found high prolactin hormone in my blood. He still didn’t connect the two. So I had to start digging for myself. Like any hormone, they play vital roles in our body. Well this hormone is a pregnant lady hormone. I’m a male. (I know go ahead LOL) well that was it. My body was all out of wack. The tumor, because of where it was, was causing this hormone. Thus causing my brain fog. 

5 years after that second episode which was 2018. I had another flare where I discovered all of that in the paragraph above. I haven’t gotten fixed because that doctor wouldn’t take it serious. 

Now two years later. 2020 I flared up just a month ago. I’m coming down now but I’m with another doctor. He’s more aware of my condition. 

In conclusion, I have never suffered from depression,anxiety, low libido, mental challenges  when I’m the normal me. I’m a funny easy going person. So I know I didn’t need any of those pills for depression and stuff. I only became those things when the fog set in because I was basically stupid for a month or two. That’s was made me depressed and anxious and sad. 

The tumor is my cause. Too much prolactin hormone. The tumor is on my pituitary gland causing it to produce this wild amount of the hormone. Now you can see the problem here. Woman hormone inside a male body for too long. But this problem knows no gender, women suffer from this tumor as well and I have known some to have the brain fog as well. 

If you guys and gals have any questions or want to talk to someone. I’m here. I know how bad this can be. The nasty thoughts that can run through your head.

12,I now feel 95% better than in the last 2 years,"I suffered for about two years from brain fog. There were also some other symptoms like heart palpitations, headaches etc. After about a year I got the first diagnose in fructose intolerance. From that point on I left any fructose out of my diet but the brain fog which was by far the worst symptom of all didn’t go away.  But that first diagnose started me to look after stomach/Microbiom issues that could cause brain fog. I know that there are several potential intolerances and I would suggest anyone to try different diets to find trigger foods. For me I am pretty sure that it is a histamine related issue. 

I take some supplements which helped me to feel like myself again for the last months and when there are new phases of brain fog I can get them under control a lot quicker than I used to. These phases are very rare though.I take 1000 mg Vitamin C devided in two portions per day, I take 2x 500 mg Quercetin with that, also one in the morning and one  in the afternoon, I take a Probiotic recommended by a naturalist I saw, I take psyllium husks everyday and I mix some spiroulina powder with water each morning. I still try to have a pretty low histamine diet. Doing that I got my stomach problems under control and with that also my brain fog. I even tried some histamine rich foods and some alcohol again and I didn’t have any major fall backs. 

I just wanted to write my story about it as I was on this sub almost all of the last 2 years and I felt that I have to share my experiences.

15,The path to finding out the root cause to my brain fog with data,"Hey,

This one took me +6months to get to. First, I have to say that when I first started fixing my brainfog I tried the keto diet, which helped at the beginning but shortly after, my brain fog returned. I got hooked to nootropics and supplements like Neuromaster from Bulletproof or L-Theanine which helped but it was not enough.

&#x200B;

After much reading and research, I landed reading more into how **hormones and vitamins** could affect the way you think on a daily basis. I found a company, get-base, that personalizes an at-home lab testing plan to help you track certain symptoms and fix them by matching your data with clinical trials. Some nerd advance stuff but all managed from your app.

&#x200B;

Eventually I discovered by using the [app](https://get-base.com/?rbf) and their at-home tests (you can also go to Quest) that the **root cause was on my Vitamin D & B12 deficiencies**. From there I implemented some of the app recommendations:

* Added some beef back to my diet
* Started to go outside for walks
* Took 1,000 IUs Vit D every other day + the Trader Joe's Vit B12 every day.

After 2 months I went back to feel like there's no need to pause during the day, my work meetings are back to normal (I don't stutter, de-rail or browse the internet without purpose).

I'm 33 and I was a regular sufferer of a BF. It happened to me first during a depression period I had a few years ago. Back then, I slept very poorly (2-3h per day) and I thought that the 'unconnected' feeling was because of that. Since my recovery from the depression, I have suffered from a BF time to time. It was taking me down for a few days once ever a month or two. I did not care that much as after a few days, it went away.

In the beginning of 2020, I got into a long period of BF, it took me down for more than a month. I was unable to spot the trigger of my BF. I tried to log down my food, my sleep, my mood, the weather ... but nothing helped. Moreover, I found it very hard to explain to someone how I feel. What do you tell your loved ones about how you feel if you cannot feel yourself? The best explanation I found was I'm feeling like behind a glass, my reflexes are automatic, I don't feel like myself, I feel like an observer of myself. My BF was always the strongest during the day, disappearing during the late afternoon. My evenings were usually BF free or with BF on very low levels. I went to see my GP and had myself tested (high pressure, blood, inflammation - pretty common tests) as I was afraid of having RS  - all was good. I went for another round of psychotherapy with a new professional (I stopped the first one after I got recovered from the depression), but it did not help either, so I stopped it. I was a bit overweight that time, but I did not care as I did strong man workouts and had plenty of muscles too - I exercised regularly 3-5 times a week. Then, one day I was taking a shower, the BF disappeared. I remember the feeling of my brain started to function normally - I went to the shower with BF and went out without BF. Pretty funny right? But the bad thing - I was unable to spot the trigger. The BF just came and went, with me unable to find out what caused it.

The next few months were BF free and I thought it's gone. Then, at the end of June, it started again. This time I was unable to recover till late September (!). During this period, I spent most of the days with BF. It was one of the most frustrating periods of my life. It went away for a few days during my holidays abroad in August, but then it came back. In the beginning of September I was pretty worn out and desperate, not knowing what to do. I have a decent office job that I like, but it is quite often stressful (who's is not, right) and my workday is usually full of abstract thinking and math. You can imagine that one does not perform great with BF running full on. I started to search for help online and I was fortunate to found this reddit group. I did try to find some information about BF back then, when it occurred for the first time with my depression, but that time I was unable to find anything. It is hard to search for something if you don't know how to name it. The same paradox is like explaining what's with you to your loved ones (I found the term 'Brain Fog' quite late).

So, beginning of September, I read plenty of the comments on this reddit group and decided to start cutting down some of my habits whilst adding some healthy tips to my days. I told myself - if I feel like shit all day long, what can I lose? I logged everything into my calendar, and this is how it look like:

&#x200B;

* 2.9.2020 START sleeping regularly (using 'Sleep Cycle', 11pm - 6:30am)
* 3.9.2020 START psychotherapy with a new professional
* 7.9.2020 START eating broth as a main meal at least once a week
* 10.9.2020 STOP gluten (0g of gluten since this day)
* 13.9.2020 STOP coffee (no coffee since this day)
* 15.9.2020 START taking probiotics daily
* 18.9.2020 START WHM (retention breathing daily & cold showers daily)
* 20.9.2020 STOP drinking alcohol on any occasion
* 22.9.2020 START liver tea treatment (2 x daily a cleansing liver tee)
* 24.9.2020 STOP drinking carbonated water
* 25.9.2020 STOP caffeine (I drink only pure water & herbal / fruit tea after this day)

&#x200B;

Apart from the above, I also do exercise 2 / 3 times a week - jogging / swimming / hiking - I'd been doing these before, so nothing new. In the beginning of September, I also started a simple memory training exercise. In this exercise, I visualize a centre of the town where I live and try to name all streets there.

In the end of September, I started to feel better. It started with a day where I had only a mild BF in the morning and then felt BF free in the afternoon. The next day I was again back in full BF, but the day after, I got another 'half day' without BF. Then, since 28th of September, I've had 0 days with BF!

As you can see, I did quite a lot of things to get rid of BF. I cannot say what helped the most, but I can say they helped as a whole. Psychotherapy was a great thing to start again, I finally found someone with whom I feel comfortable and who helped me to let go of the stress I was holding inside. The WHM is pretty fun to do, it took a few weeks to get used to the cold showers, but now I feel energized when taking them. Caffeine was a tough one, I really miss cappuccino from my local coffee place and a green tea I used to drink in the afternoons. But caffeine was still easily achievable in comparison with the 0 gluten diet - it is hard to get rid of gluten products if you eat them 3x or 4x per a day. I had to start shopping in different places and think more about my meals. But I do not mind now - I found the gluten free diet to be healthy and tasty, one just needs to get used to it. The carbonised water stop was one of the most surprising. I used to drink 3l - 4l of carbonised water per day (!) and did not realize that until I stopped. Now I see how much of that I consumed and I'm glad I'm back to regular water.

My plan for the rest of 2020 is to try to start with some of the 'stopped' habits and see what happens. I would like to return to caffeine and occasional alcohol consumption by the end of the year. I'm not going back to carbonised water as it is something I can live without and I stopped the liver tea treatment a few weeks ago. I'll definitely continue with the broth consumption (I really enjoy Pho soup) and the probiotics (I eat soured products with probiotics daily). If this works, I want to reduce the full gluten stop to a semi-full stop - I would like to be able to have a meal with gluten once in a while, but that is probably a 2021 target.

I'd been suffering for months of BF and was pretty desperate - this reddit group narrowed my perspective and gave me ideas to try. In a few weeks, a set of changes to my daily routine worked out and since then I feel good, 100% BF free. I want to pay back to the community and share my story - I hope it will help someone to fight this ugly thing that takes the feeling of life away from us.

0,My (Personal) Brain Fog Cure: Fixed For Months Now And A Very Long Journey Full Of Warnings,"TL;DR: Check for the following: Mold / Allergies / Allergen response

So I'm very fortunate that I can come here and say I've been brain fog free for well over 6 months now. In fact, I was going to write this article months ago but had forgotten all about it until today. I always promised if I could get out of BF I would write about how I escaped for others. Especially since I scoured this forum along with many others when I was in the hell that is the fog.

So, here is my story. 27 y/o male.

Back in 2018 I first developed the brain fog. I was working a travel heavy job and on one trip it just hit me and caused all the usual symptoms: can't think, can't speak well, felt ""fogged"", trouble recalling anything, difficulty concentrating, head feeling full, fatigue, etc. Luckily, it went away. Well, until it came back again.

For the longest time it would only show up for a week or so at a time. Then it would disappear. In 2019, however, that all changed. I started to have it constantly. It was hell. I couldn't get rid of it.

I tried everything.

* I did the full stupid diet(s): carnivore, paleo, low FODMAP, all of it. Strict. They helped temporarily, but never for long term.
* I did the candida, leaky gut whatever, and SIBO stuff. Took the meds. All it did was cause stomach aches. Was pointless.
* I had a brain MRI. All clear.
* I had a comprehensive bloodwork done numerous times. Vitamins good. Everything else all clear. Thyroid great.
* Went to a neuro. She just thought I was a nutcase and wanted to give me anti-depressants. Hard pass. I know i'm fine mentally.
* Got a sleep test done. All clear besides minor things I don't care about.
* Did a GI test. All good.
* Tried natural anti-inflammatories. Tries non-natural anti-inflammatories. Nope.
* Antibiotics for a bacterial infection assumption. Yeah... No.
* Completely relaxed, minimized stress, and unloading all responsibilities. Nah, not stress related.
* Checked for hypoglycemia by pricking myself 500 times over the course of a few weeks. Nope.
* Slept more often. Slept less often. Drank coffee. Quit caffeine entirely. Tried it all.
* Tried nootropics. Only gave me anxiety.
* Addressed ""posture"" (whatever that was supposed to do). Nada
* Got a checkup by a dentist. All good.
* Hell I nearly went to a naturopath because I was getting so desperate.

All of this over the course of the year(ish). It sucked. It seemed like there was no way out.

That was, until I seen another post mention allergies. I got to thinking about the allergy side of things: I was always allergic to everything as a kid (even though I'm not now), had asthma, and all of that shit. 

So, I went to an allergist to get tested. Did the blood work. What I found? Every allergen was skyhigh. My IgE showed my body was currently under a massive immune response. My ENT was actually surprised, he hadn't seen levels of allergens that bad for awhile apparently. 

Pretty obvious: massive inflammation from constant allergen response = slowing degrading mental health = brain fog.

I did also get a CAT scan of my nose afterwards as well. It was relatively okay: bit deviated with some turbinate problems but nothing that'd I would personally do surgery for ever. Really, it was just what was going in my nose that was likely the problem. 

I started taking Flonase and a daily anti-histamine and it helped, but did not cure it. I also started doing allergy shots, but those take years to work and are largely irrelevant except for my personal desire to reduce allergies now.

It wasn't until I started to think about the root cause that I fixed it. Why was my allergies crazy now? What happened? Why all of the sudden?

Well, in 2018 I moved into a new apartment. I was doing a travel heavy gig for a long time before then and during the first part of living there. In 2019, however, I was put into telework only - stay at home position. So, I was getting relief from the mold/allergies in the apartment by leaving but then in 2019 I was just staying in the apartment for 90% of the time. A constant hit of those allergens.

This is crucial information because I noticed in the summer my symptoms finally let up quite a bit - always in the summer I would have slightly more relief - this was because I didn't have the heater on anymore. There was no central air. 

I got to investigating and found a massive foundation leak in the bedroom. It was so bad that mushrooms were growing under the carpet and in the walls. This, additionally, had infected the heater ducts. 

So in effect I was blowing straight mold that my allergist response said I was hysterically allergic to (to the tune of a double digits immune response) directly into my face 24/7. That explains why summer was slightly better, I didn't have the air running so it wasn't as constant.

The Flonase helped a bit to stop it but wouldn't fully stop it. Likewise, turning off the heater helped by not circulating it as much but didn't fully stop it. This also explains why the diets above kinda helped sometimes - they lowered my immune response by reducing other inflammation triggers (what I was eating). 

It wasn't until I left that old, horrible apartment that my health really improved. Even then, it took awhile. Months. 

I didn't do any of the silly mold detox things or the ""shoemaker protocol"". I think that's just an anxiety trigger and not helpful. I was already burnt out by the ""candida"" and other quick-fixes that turned out to be bogus pseudo-science. I just waited. Now, slowly over time, my brain improved. I feel 100% back to normal now and have been for months. No relapses. 

I'm not sure if it was the ""toxic mold"" everyone is so afraid of or if it was simply a massive allergy response. I don't know if I will ever know. But I know that brain fog is absolute hell and I'm sure at least one of you has it in similar to me. For me, it was the mold, allergies, or whatever the hell was in that old shitty apartment. 

So: check for mold. Go to an allergist. 

One other piece of advice: I kept a very detailed Excel spreadsheet with a tracker of things to try and things I have tried along with daily ""how bad is it"" answers. I also wrote in it about how different things helped/did not help and such. I truly believed that the excel spreadsheet helped me a lot. It kept me focused on the end goal of fixing it and realizing I still had the power to go forward. It was also super helpful when I brought my laptop to doctor appointments because then they knew I was serious. Walk into a doc room as a young male and say brain fog and they just want to throw anti-depressants at you and tell you to go home. Don't listen to them. Fight for true medical care. This is one way that helps a lot (or at least it did for me).

And good luck. That fog was the worst thing I have ever lived through. But once you get on the other side you respect life and every day so much more than my previous self ever thought possible.",jvhiiw,90,1.0,40,2020-11-16 23:10:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/jvhiiw/my_personal_brain_fog_cure_fixed_for_months_now/,False,False,2020,11

2,"My brain fog is gone. As such, I'll be saying goodbye to this subreddit. Before I go, I want to give some advice/tips that really helped me","I don't know what caused it, and I don't know what fixed it, but I do know what *really* helped. 

I got multiple tests done, including an MRI, all coming back normal. I felt like I was going insane because I had this issue that was affecting me quite greatly but I couldn't find an answer as to what it was. I stopped driving. I stopped going to my martial arts class. My schoolwork suffered. 

All that to say, I wasn't doing so great, but eventually I found habits that I believe really helped me that I hope can help some of you too. 

**1. Eat well**

I'm lucky enough to have the time to cook every meal for myself. I personally eat a whole foods plant based diet, but I'm a firm believer in staying away from processed foods and sugar as much as possible, regardless of what you eat outside of that. 

There's a huge selection of recipes out there that you can cater to your lifestyle and what amount of time you have. If you don't have a lot of time, you could either prep meals beforehand and store them in the freezer or whip up something quick. It takes trial and error, but eventually you'll find your groove and what works for you. If you do want to eat plant based, the cookbook ""The No Meat Athlete Cookbook"" helped me a ton. What you eat is super important, and it's something a lot of people neglect without realizing it. 

**2. Exercise** 

This is also super important. After a few months of regularly exercising, I can't begin to describe how good I feel after each workout. I started weight training a few weeks ago (I was mostly doing cardio beforehand) and I'm feeling great. Again, this is something that may take some time as you find what really works for you. My advice is to find something fun that also gives you a good workout. I personally take martial arts classes in addition to weight training every other day.  


I know, especially with brain fog, it can be hard to find the motivation to exercise every day, but contrary to what a lot of people believe, motivation comes from action, not the other way around. If you're having a rough day, just say ""I'll just do 5 minutes of x"", and often you'll find that you want to keep going. If not, that's okay, but don't half-ass it every time and quit early. Once you get into something, after a couple of weeks you'll find (I did, at least) that you look forward to exercising because you feel so good afterward. 

**3. Get off of social media!!!**

I already feel bad typing this whole thing on Reddit lol. I find that when I spend a lot of time mindlessly scrolling through Reddit or YouTube (the same thing applies to any social media), my brain gets foggy, so I try and stay away as much as possible. I got rid of Instagram and TikTok and I've considered leaving this site too, but for now I just really limit the time I spend on it. I'm sure you've heard about the dangers of social media and all that, so I don't want to write another book telling you the same thing, but trust me, replacing social media with something valuable like reading or whatever hobby or skill you're trying to learn will help you so much. 

**4. Meditate**

 I won't go into too much detail about this either, but just starting with mindfulness videos on YouTube are helpful. Or, Google different practices or techniques you'd like to try. 

**5. Lastly, don't become so obsessed with fixing the issue that you neglect everything else**

Like I said earlier, I became so fixated on returning to normal that I did nothing but try and find the answer, and I quit most everything else. I stopped driving, I stopped going to my martial arts classes, I stopped going out with friends and family, and I stopped doing my schoolwork. I went to doctors appointments, then went home and crashed. 

Now, I'm obviously not saying that you should abandon all your efforts to get better, but don't let this issue stop you from living your life. Don't delay getting evaluated for a possible medical issue, but if, like me, you find that every test comes back normal and you can't seem to find the answer, don't give up because you think there's no hope. 

I had to come to terms with the fact that the tests showed I was physically okay, and I didn't have a medical explanation as to what was going on. I decided that I had to return to living my life and stop moping around all day. I made some changes and adopted some good habits, and a few months later, I'm feeling great. 

Regardless of whether you have brain fog or not, and no matter the intensity of it, these are all good practices for a healthy life in general. I wish you all well on your journeys, and with that, I say goodbye.",jwkmbp,70,0.95,14,2020-11-18 17:56:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/jwkmbp/my_brain_fog_is_gone_as_such_ill_be_saying/,False,False,2020,11
3,Finally found the cause of my brain fog - UARS/Sleep Apnea,"Hi all,

Context: 25Male, Singapore. Symptoms: Brain fog, neck pains, headaches, fatigue, poor sleep quality, low libido, mild depression, anxiety, super low energy

After 3 months of endless brain fog, and searching. I will be going for surgery tomorrow, a UPPP and Tonsil reduction surgery. I was diagnosed with UARS (upper airway resistance syndrome), in which my respiratory disturbance index (RDI) was more than 15 (15.2 and 16.3 to be exact), after taking 2 watchpat sleep test. I hope that this is the cure.

**Advice to everyone having cognitive issues/brain fog:**

1. Please go and **get a sleep test done**. Watchpat Sleep test would be my advice. Sleep Apnea/UARS is a super common cause for cognitive/memory issues due to the absence of proper regenerative sleep. I never thought in my wildest dreams that I would have a sleep disorder.
2. Do not visit functional doctors - these guys are really a waste of time and money. They give diagnosis like adrenal fatigue which essentially does not really help you, unless you have vitamin deficiency

**Steps that I took over the past 3 months:**

1. Psychiatrist - I tried anti depressants for awhile. I **DO NOT** advise this route, as your brain fog is real. It is natural that you feel sucky, low energy, anxious if your cognition/brain dramatically slows down. Also, sometimes, the SSRI (anti depressants) - which it can improve/stabilize your mood, sometimes its placebo, and also some SSRIs can further slowdown your brain - which is not what you want
2. Upper cervical chiropractor - **To Try!** I visited one, and had a neck x-ray done. Sometimes, subluxation can cause fogginess, but i think it needs to be issues with the C1-C2 axis/atlas portion. After doing 9 sessions of chiropractic care, it did not help my brain fog though - I feel that the chiropractor simply pushed me to sign up for a package to make money. However, I realized that my neck pains were arising due to my sleep issues. My airways/neck was adjusting in a forward neck posture to maximise the airflows. (This is my hypothesis and was according to Dr Kenny Pang's medical journal)
3. Blood test - **Necessary -** check for your thyroid. My blood test appeared healthy as a fiddle and the doctors thought I was nuts to have all these issues.
4. Functional doctor - **Please do not waste your time.** I did a cortisol test, bought tons of vitamins that the functional doctor recommended, did not do shit
5. Considered doing a brain MRI - **I honestly think this will not achieve much.** A neuro can only help you if you have a brain tumour - even if your brain MRI shows issues - I'm not sure what steps he can help. I've been reading the forum and many people took brain MRIs with no tangible help

**Other smart moves to do:**

1. **Allergy test** \- sometimes food/natural allergies can result in fogginess - I will be doing a full skin prick test tomorrow during/after the surgery
2. Hormonal checks - **Not 100% certain whether this makes sense -** but I think for some, hormonal replacement therapy helps

**What kept me going for the past 3 months:**

1. **It is okay to feel sucky. Brain fog is real.** Get out, exercise, walk, swim, try and eat healthy. This helps you to survive
2. **Keep searching -** I do not know whether I will be cured after tomorrow's SURGERY with the ENT doctor.
3. **Brain fog is not very well understood. The medical community is not very updated on this.** As such, you have to persist and google, keep searching.

Will update after the surgery tomorrow, and if there is anything I missed, please add on/correct. Hoping for bluer skies, and hope that this helps someone out there who is struggling.

**(UPDATES) 10 days after surgery (9 Dec) :**

1. Throat remains slightly sore still, no bleeding from either nose/throat anymore. R**ecovery is on track**. However, some nasal congestion remains, which leads me to breathe from my mouth occasionally when I sleep. Trying to wipe out the nasal congestions so that my sleep quality can realize its full potential
2. **Mental fogginess has partially lifted** \- reading abilities have improved, feel more present in the moment. Able to take small steps to start to plan my day, and am starting to feel that a good momentum is kicking in
3. Sleeping 8 hours regularly - will wake up once or twice to clear my nasal congestions - sleep quality is still not perfect, but **I feel ready to start the day** after 8 hours of rest. Sleeping sideways helps. Fatigue quantum is slightly less
4. **Headches are GONE - neck pains less.**
5. I think the surgery is working - **feeling sharper, kinda excited to be honest.**
6. **Allergy test results -** Skin prick and RAST allergy test came back - mild allergies to dust mites, food wise nothing.
7. **Sleep Doctor claims** that in a week's time i will feel drastically better - and that breathing/sleep quality will keep improving as the nose/throat tissues recover

Best,

4,My lack of cognitive precision and mental fog is wreaking havoc on my life.,"I was never accused of being smart growing up. I wasn’t valedictorian and there were no Harvard Law degrees in my future. That said, I never really thought of myself as slow or stupid. I felt pretty middle-of-the-pack.  
I grew up in a 2-parent, median income home. Both my parents have undergraduate degrees. My mother is bilingual and my father works as a lab analyst so you’d think I’d be at least genetically predisposed for average intelligence.  
Unfortunately, I have the memory of a fruit fly. I have to take notes during meetings at work. I’m the guy who asks the dumb question at the end of meeting and everyone rolls their eyes. I can’t remember names even after I just heard them. I’m constantly realizing I’ve said something stupid only after the words have left my mouth. 
I like to play basketball but can NEVER keep track of the score. Unless I’m actively trying to remember something, my brain’s default setting is to dump the information moments after it’s been processed. 
I have trouble talking about most anything once you get past general surface knowledge. My brain loses details and I lack precision on any topic. I have trouble relaying accurate information to people and am constantly second guessing myself.  
I come off as a very disorganized person because I constantly must check notes and calendars when I’m talking about things in the future or past. I keep 100s of notes in my phone, many are checklists, so I don’t get side-tracked at work.  
I have a very poor concept of time. I can’t distinguish between things that happen 6 months ago and 2 years ago. I can’t seem to gauge how long I have or how long I need to accurately complete a project. I have trouble prioritizing tasks as well. It’s as if my brain can’t retain small bits information long enough to analyze it in its entirety. Complex projects stress me out and multi-tasking slows computing speed to a crawl. When I do learn a new skill, I seem to not progress past a basic level. I lack the ability to analyze and assess ways to improve normally.  
I am laughably bad at directions. I must routinely go somewhere before I learn how to get there, and I forget very quickly. I remember directions like you’d memorize a list of random words instead of points on an internal map.  
This memory retention problem even chips away at some of my identity. I have trouble creating comprehensive goals for my future and struggle with maintaining goals. I fail to keep goals in the forefront of my mind and require constant reminders. I have trouble deferring gratification and weighing long term risk/reward ratios.  
This condition KILLS my confidence. When I meet new people, I’m always wondering how long it is before they realize I’m a completed moron. I’ve become a quieter person because I’m afraid I’ll say something inaccurate or can’t keep up with the conversation. When I do make small talk, I keep the topics light and broad. I’m CONSTANTLY second guessing myself about everything. It sucks not being 100% sure about most things I talk about. I’ve seen a therapist for some of the memory issues there isn’t much anyone can do.  
I’ve never officially been diagnosed with anything but I’m hyper aware of this deficiency. I’m in my mid-thirties so I feel like it’s early to have any age-related mental decline. This should be the time in my life where I’m the most capable and productive. 
I don’t like giving people wrong information. I want to be trusted and accurate when I speak. I want to be given large complex tasks without messing them all up because I can’t understand timelines, prioritization, or multitasking. I don’t enjoy being the idiot among my peers. I want to progress to ‘expert level’ at SOMETHING, but my memory and lack of knowledge retention is always a huge obstacle. I wish I were either smarter or dumb enough to not be aware of it.  

Does anyone else feel this way or have these symptoms? 

TL;DR  My brain is a fractured mess and it’s really affecting my life negatively.

7,I just want my old brain back,"Ever since I've poisoned myself, which caused brain damage things have not been the same since and for a long time (about 8 years) I have tried to adapt to the change.

But today and recently, its starting to wear me out and I'm getting tired, I just want a day off from it but no that's not possible it can only get worse I'd imagine. I can't think, I can't feel as much, it's just static up there, life is really weird and I don't feel like myself not anymore, I feel almost mindless, I'm just a phycisal person now there is nothing much going in up here anymore.

Today, my head hurts a bit, got this overwhelming sense of dread, I can only curl up in a corner of the room because I just want to get away from this and go back to the time before I poisoned myself. My life would have been different for the better, I feel like I'm living a 50% of my life and on potentially burrowed time. I can't do this anymore, I'm too terrified I'm too tired I don't want this to get worse I just want my old brain back.

Otherwise, there's nothing ahead of me. Nothing.",jxufdx,29,0.91,18,2020-11-20 18:21:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/jxufdx/i_just_want_my_old_brain_back/,False,False,2020,11
8,"I feel like I’m dying, and I’m getting worse. I need your help.","8 months. It’s been 8 months with constant daily brain fog, and on more than half of the days it’s so bad I literally feel like I’m dying. Something is seriously wrong, on the bad days like today I am completely non functional. Today, I couldn’t leave the house because my brain was so foggy and tired that all I wanted to do was lay down and distract myself. I also had a terrible headache all day.  

Throughout these 8 months, I have learned close to nothing about what is causing my brain fog and what’s makes it better or worse, which is really depressing as I can’t even find a way to start improving. So far:

-eating: makes me feel slightly better for a short time (minutes).  
-sleeping: the amount I sleep and it’s quality seems to effect the severity of my fog, but not by much.  
-caffeine/stimulants: help me power through the fog sometimes, but don’t improve it.  
-exercise: seems to help the fog mildly for the day of, but relief is very short term.  
-stress: makes the fog much, much worse. My brain just can’t handle stress anymore.   
-medications: no effect, and I’ve tried NSAIDs, benzos, and others all in an attempt to help the fog.   
-supplements: so far no effect and fish oil makes it worse. Multivitamin, vitamin D, and coq10 all have no effect.   

Secondary symptoms. Like many on here, I have several secondary symptoms that accompany my brain fog but seem to point to multiple issues:   

-tension headaches, ear fullness/pressure, and jaw tension, all on one side: this started a few months before the fog did, but is no longer at its worst.  
-acid reflux: curiously, this seems to get worse when the fog is at its worst.  
-fatigue: along with the brain fog is some serious fatigue that feels 100% mental, ie my brain feels exhausted. My body itself does not feel weak but my brain wants to do absolutely nothing because it feels exhausted.   
-eyes: my eyes feel so tired, almost dry when I’m fogged.  
-some aches and pains: during this time I’ve developed some mild back pain.   
-depression and anxiety: anxiety is mostly controlled, but depression started shortly after the fog did and has only gotten worse.   

Medically, my doctors can’t find anything wrong with me. I’ve been checked and tested by neurologists, rheumatologists, ENTs, allergists, cardiologists, endocrinologists, and my primary. My blood work is immaculate. My heart is healthy. I have no allergies. My thyroid is fine and my testosterone levels are perfect. No hard evidence of any autoimmune diseases was found. The inside of my ears look fine. My ENT found some mild inflammation in my sinuses and nasal passages along with a deviated septum, but I’m pretty sure I’ve always had these issues.   

Yet I sit here day after day getting slowly but steadily worse. My social life has collapsed, my personal relationships are severely strained, my finances are slowly dwindling, and no one seems to be able to help me. I really don’t know how much longer I can keep going. I’m slowly losing everything, and as a previously healthy 30 year old it’s quite traumatizing.   

Does anyone have any suggestions for what I can do?",jntnco,29,0.98,42,2020-11-04 09:17:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/jntnco/i_feel_like_im_dying_and_im_getting_worse_i_need/,False,False,2020,11
9,I figured it out!,"I finally got rid of my debilitating brain fog, which I'd experienced since about January. I understand that what I'm about to say may seem obvious to some of you, as may in this group suggested this was the cause, but, I grossly underestimated its significance, and it took me a long time to finally give it a shot. ALCOHOL. Hopefully, if anyone is as skeptical as I was, this post will entice them to actually give abstinence a go. 

I'd been on and off anti-depressants for the preceding 6 months or so, but didnt take to a particular one because of their tendency to cause brain fog. I'm in law school, so I really couldnt afford to sacrifice sharpness for anything, especially to that degree. I've always partied and binge drank, but it has never caused any brain fog past a hangover lasting a day or two. I have never been a daily drinker. One night in january I went out and drank pretty heavily, and stopped taking my anti-depressants the day after. I'm 31, so my hangovers are awful at this point anyway. However, the effects of that particular hangover lasted about a week. This was unprecedented and extremely worrying. To make things worse, I still had horrible brain fog---it felt like I was still taking antidepressants. When I had previously come off antidepressants, I would regain my sharpness in a matter of days, but not this time. I was starting to think that antidepressants had caused me permanent brain damage and I would never be cured.

I tried everything. Vitamin supplements, every diet you can think of, exercise. My psych prescribed me meds for ADHD, which helped quite a bit, but even those have their negative side effects. Not a permanent solution. There were incremental benefits, but nothing substantial. Something was definitely different in my head, and honestly,if we werent pass/fail last semester (thanks COVID), I'm not sure how I would have done. My internship was remote as well, thankfully, otherwise people would have seen what an embarrassingly unproductive zombie I'd become. Analytical writing does not mesh with brain fog. I would frequently work until 9 pm and some weekends just to finish work that I should have been getting done in a quarter of the time.

I came to this sub periodically for advice. Some suggested I cut out drinking. However, I didnt think I was drinking nearly enough for it to be the cause. Some weeknights I would have 1 or 2, and on the weekends i would have maybe 12 total. Occasionally, I'd party hard. It was never an issue before, right? So why would it be now? Man, I could NOT have been more wrong.

This month I decided to do a ""sober october."" Ironically, it wasn't even for brain fog. I had sadly conceded to living with it for the rest of my life. I just wanted to be healthier. However, It did cross my mind that I had never truly given an honest shot to ruling alcohol out as the cause. 

I started noticing improvements within weeks. Now, after a month of complete sobriety, my brain fog has disappeared. I'm on top of things, and I'm happy again. Clearly, alcohol affects you differently as you age, and I must have reached that point. If you're reading this and have not ruled out substances as the cause, do yourself a favor and just try it out for a month--you might be surprised just how far seemingly benign alcohol use can go. 

Thanks to everyone for all the support I've received here in the past, and I'm sorry for not listening sooner. I hope everyone is able to find a way to cure their brain fog. I don't foresee how people would have many questions for me, but I'm here to answer if you do.

13,I AM ALMOST THERE! PLEASE READ! CURE FOR SOME,"UPDATE 1- I had my second sleep study last night and I indeed have sleep apnea and was hooked up to a cpap machine. I have a very mild case of only 10 awakenings per hour but even a low number can cause issues. I felt a little better this morning when I woke up with a cpap. But for some people it takes a few weeks or a few months to truly notice the benefits. So in 3 weeks I’m going in for a follow up and they are going to give me my cpap supplies/ instructions. So I’m really looking forward to life now, now that I finally found my problem. I’ll post some updates down the road with how I’m feeling mentally after being on cpap for a while. If u have any questions just ask me I’ll try to answer them to my best ability with this Brain fog crap. But please stay optimistic everyone it won’t be this way forever and there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. Keep on keeping on <3

Thank you for the award that’s the first reddit award I ever got haha) 
 I am so close to curing my brain fog, I have tried almost every thing and test in the book bloodwork scans all that fun stuff tried antifungals for suspected candida brain fog none of that did jack. With all this brain fog I’ve been experiencing I’ve never put two and two together. I have been experiencing constant fatigue and tiredness ever since I developed brain fog. Low and behold my dumb self never thought well gee maybe I have a sleep issue, so I went for a sleep study the 9th and apparently I was showing some signs of sleep apnea, I’m still waiting for my results but I am scheduled for another appointment the 19th to confirm if I have sleep apnea and if I do I’m getting configured for a cpap machine. I have been browsing the sleep apnea reddit forums and stuff and the members said I have a lot of the same symptoms they’ve experienced. And a extremely common symptom they’ve experienced and other sleep apnea patients have experienced is BRAIN FOG. POOR COGNITION. TERRIBLE SHORT TERM MEMORY . SPACINESS DEREALIZED FEELING. DRUNK FEELING. DETACHED. POOR COMPREHENSION. ALL THESE BRAIN FOG SYMPTOMS. And it makes so much sense because with sleep apnea you never reach the deep sleep stages because your body is constantly waking you up to breathe when your sleeping so you keep restarting the cycles over and over again never getting to the deep stages. And in the deep stages things pertaining to memory happen and cognition. People report feeling cured of the memory and cognition problems after being on cpap. So I’m waiting for the 19th to come and to get on cpap. I feel really positive and I think I’m nearing the finish line after all this time of trying to find what is wrong with me. So please do not lose hope I know it’s scary and annoying but you are fine and you are gonna make it out the trenches. Just hang in there. And if you have sleep issues or never feel rested and brain foggish, sleep disorders could be what’s wrong with you so seriously consider those!! (I AM ONLY 19 YEARS OLD AND I AM A MALE 5’9” 170 pounds, SLEEP APNEA DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE AND CAN AFFECT EVERYBODY, TODDLERS INCLUDED SO ANYONE CAN GET IT I MEAN ANYONE, EVEN THE SLIGHTEST SLEEP APNEA CASE CAN CAUSE ISSUES).  And after reflecting back on everyone’s posts and stuff and the more I think about it, a majority of you might just be extremely extremely sleep deprived, because a lot of the users list fatigue and tiredness as their main symptoms so I honestly feel like a lot of people just need to do a sleep study and they most likely have sleep apnea. Now I know there are other illnesses and diseases and issues that might cause the symptoms of fatigue so please do not discredit those at all, sleep apnea may not be everyone’s cause of tiredness",jtat0m,25,1.0,13,2020-11-13 04:43:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/jtat0m/i_am_almost_there_please_read_cure_for_some/,False,False,2020,11

16,Brain fog after a single incident,"Hi. Long story short, I have had brain fog for the last 7ish years. 

When I was about 15/16 years old I was out drinking and smoking weed with my friends camping. The next day I was pretty hungover and was suffering in bed with anxiety. I felt a panic attack coming on so got out of bed and in a flustered state paced down the stairs. I got half way down the stairs when my mum talked to me from the bottom and asked if I was alright. I turned around and started to walk back up the stairs and passed out falling down the stairs and trapping my head between something. I came to in what must have been 15 seconds later (roughly) I felt extremely ill, dizzy and could hardly stand up 

Ever since that moment I have had brain fog/de-realisation. It was really bad at first but has got better over time. I still suffer from it now and would like to think one day I could at least return to being “normal” again.

Symptoms include: Anxiety, poor spacial awareness, not being able to live in the moment, brain fog, de-realisation.

Just wanted to know if there was anyone who could recommend a treatment for me specific to the way I got Brain fog or what they think could be causing it I saw a couple people talking about the neck cutting off blood flow due to alignment, could be from where I fell down the stairs and trapped my neck...",jr8y9y,21,1.0,8,2020-11-09 23:18:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/jr8y9y/brain_fog_after_a_single_incident/,False,False,2020,11

-irritability 
-not wanting to talk or form words
-feeling like my head is going to topple off my shoulders 
-disassociation to my environment

I’ve had an MRA and CAT scan on my head and the doctors said they’re fine. They’re trying to get me an MRI but my insurance won’t accept it yet because there’s no evidence that I need one. I’m so tired of nobody listening to me. I can’t do my homework anymore for school, I can’t play video games like I used to. The noises and movements overwhelm me too much and trigger my brain fog. I’m so upset and I miss feeling normal.",jxiel7,20,1.0,12,2020-11-20 04:20:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/jxiel7/anyone_have_tips/,False,False,2020,11
0,Somehow I’ve destroyed my brain,"I have obsessed over these issues every day of my life for 8-9 years. It’s gotten progressively worse. The last few years have been a blur and it feels like my childhood never happened. 

I’ve had severe chronic treatment resistant depression for almost half my life. I’m almost 20 now and I’m a complete failure. I used to allegedly have an iq around 150 and before I had these issues as a kid and I was sharp. But over time somehow my issues have gotten so bad I can barely take living anymore. I used to be the smart kid. Like I was the leader and did well in school. Now my 2 friends who will hang out with me a few times a year treat me like I have special needs.

Now I’m below average and I do genuinely feel disabled intellectually. I used to have such an active mind where I’d just lay in bed all night having creative ideas. Now if I don’t force my self with a lot of effort I will stare into space for hours with a completely empty mind. I can barely make sentences and I cannot hardly talk. It’s not even that I’m shy, literally nothing comes to my mind. I have atrocious memory. I’ve been trying to catch up in high school due to being a homeschooled dropout. But it’s been a struggle.

I cannot memorize any process/long term thing. I cannot learn music on an instrument I cannot memorize lyrics or a paragraph no matter how hard I try. It’s hard to explain all the issues I have but I’m sure plenty of people know exactly what I’m talking about on this subreddit. I have no creativity to the point basic conversation and learning is a challenge due to the fact nothing comes to my mind. If I don’t say or do something the second I’m told it’s out of my mind. 

One time was when I about 16 at a camping trip I was holding a water bottle in my hand and I put a plate over it. I then went in front of a group of people and genuinely asked my friend if he’d seen my water bottle, he and and everyone else just stared. He then shook his head after a Second. I walked back to my tent and found I was holding it much to my embarrassment. That’s just one small example in a sea of them.

I am severely hindered in even being able to drive anywhere because I can barely remember how to get around the town I’ve lived in my whole life. 

One of the hardest things is that nobody has ever taken me seriously. There was one time for I started taking an antidepressant and was doing “NoFap” I’ll call it. And for the first time in years for just a few days I started to feel like my old self again. People literally said it was like I was a different person and they’d never seen this side of me before. But then it stopped working.  Nobody even remembers the real me because it’s been so gradual and it’s something inherently hard to see.

On a side note I don’t really see why people are so militant about denying that nofap might help some. It’s just strange to me that people feel the need to actively deny such a thing where even if it didn’t matter and was inconsequential why even waste energy denying it. But I guess that goes for a lot of stupid things people argue about.

I’ve had my iq tested since and it was apparently lower than the previous by some 30 points. But nobody really made a big deal out of it. I’m so out of it I have a very hard time even communicating with professionals I’ve seen. I don’t really put a ton of stock into intelligence tests anyway. But to me it feels like I’m running at about 10-20% the capacity I used to have. I’ve felt like for years I need to see a neurologist and have a complete and comprehensive exam. The doctors I have seen seemed very wishy washy and not very concerned with the issues I’ve stated.

I’ve had vitamin tests done and was found to be deficient in b and d I’ve taken supplements and it’s not made any difference really. I’ve had an MRI done and they said it was normal which I don’t understand because I’ve read people with depression can show differences in brain structure after mere weeks. It kinda makes me think someone was slacking or made a mistake but I’m too ignorant on it to say. My diet isn’t the best but it’s not the worst I’d say the worst thing I do is drink soda but not a lot. I go running most days and that’s all I usually have willpower/means to do anyway. I am overweight though still. I can’t believe that simply caffeine can affect me this severely. I’m not just like saying I’m like “oh I forgot this one thing should I be worried” I’m at the point I feel like a zombie and I cannot function.

My mental health issues are very severe I don’t really feel sad anymore or any emotions, in a long time. I don’t feel anything and I don’t think anything, and it’s a living hell.

I’ll really be amazed if anyone actually reads all this and responds but what other issues could I have that’s causing this? I’ve never met or heard of  anyone affected cognitively to the level I seem to be from just depression.

I used to visit an old lady in a nursing home before the stupid pandemic and I hope she’s okay. I don’t even know if she’s alive still. But she had seemed to be in the early stages of dementia. And her roommate was in the late stages. I guess one reason I visited her was because I know how it feels to have my very being/personality siphoned away so I could empathize with her.

One of my favorite analogies I guess of depression/dementia? Is in the Dark Souls video games they have creature called hollows that are basically zombies. But they lost their sanity/mind because they lost their purpose. So they just spend their days staring into space or stuck in an echo of whatever their past purpose was. 

Her roommate reminded me of a hollow as awful as it sounds and to a far lesser extent me. If I ever get better or to a point I have the ability I’m seriously considering trying to learn neuroscience so I can try to help people with these kind of issues. 

I’ve been trying to for a while to just move on and forget I ever was smart but it’s hard when it’s so crippling I don’t even seem to be average. 

I doubt anyone will read this and I don’t even know how coherent it is. I just wanted to write it down I guess for myself.",khdflg,84,0.98,42,2020-12-21 08:42:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/khdflg/somehow_ive_destroyed_my_brain/,False,False,2020,12

It's like some mystery illness that few people know about and no doctor takes you seriously especially if you're young. 

I had also developed tinnitus 2 years before my brain fog came about. I went to see an ENT about it and, surprise surprise, they couldn't find anything. The suggested treatment was basically ""just deal with it lol"".

If I knew the cause, regardless of its severity, I would at least have hope that this condition would go away. I would at least know what to work towards and not just blindly gamble with potential treatments, which ultimately don't amount to anything.",kkla2o,41,0.96,11,2020-12-26 16:33:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/kkla2o/would_anyone_here_also_be_relieved_if_they_found/,False,False,2020,12
2,Got to get this off my chest,"I’ve never felt more alone in my life. I love being around people but right now all I want to be is left alone. No matter how hard I try to explain to people how I feel they never truly understand me and it just makes me feel sadder. Everyday I have to hide how I truly feel around others because to everyone else I appear to be the same person I was before all of this happened. I just want to be that person again. I feel so disconnected like we’re two completely different people. All I want is to meet people I can finally relate to. The worst thing of all is that to other people there seems to be nothing wrong with me. I’ve been doing my absolute best to stay positive, i’ve completely changed my habits, cut out diary, gluten, refined sugar, processed foods, low histamine diet, get 10 hours of sleep, exercise frequently, but tonight at Christmas dinner everyone was enjoying all their normal food and drinking while I was practically starving myself eating whatever I could find that was okay to eat and it really hit me. Not only that but my mum decided it was a good idea to go around the table and ask everyone to say one good thing that has happened them despite the global pandemic, and when it was my turn I literally couldn’t think of a single thing that had made me happy this year and I almost just broke down in front of everyone there but instead I held it back like I always do and just said that I’m happy I didn’t get the virus. Everyone else had normal things that would genuinely make someone happy, and this just made me feel so alienated, as I just want to be with people who are like me. Truth is, this has been the worst year of my life, as I’ve spent it doing nothing but trying to just keep pushing on and being resilient, and I’m proud to say I’ve made it through this year but upon reflecting I became really sad that things still haven’t changed, after all this time. If I ever get better I’m going to devote my entire life to helping others who suffer from things like brain fog, chronic fatigue, mental illness, as I feel everyone else’s pain who’s going through the same thing and I would never wish this upon anyone, not even my worst enemy. I would say that I pray for anyone reading this but truth is I’ve lost my faith in God as well through all this :( But I do wish that all of you get through this ❤️❤️ Merry Christmas Everyone

4,Your brain fog could be due to vaping or smoking,"I spent the last two years lying to myself saying vaping had nothing to do with my brain fog. Obviously, deep down, I knew that it did to some extent. I decided to finally quit about a month ago and the change is crazy. I'm 99% cured, and my depersonalization is also 90% better.

6,Look into your sleep. You may have sleep apnea and not even know it.,"Sleep apnea occurs when your airways are partially blocked during sleep, depriving your brain of oxygen which is vital for restorative sleep. Memory formation and your ability to think clearly the next day are greatly reduced by this condition.

So if you always wake up somewhat groggy and are never truly refreshed in the morning, do a sleep study. You might have dental issues reducing the size of your airway, like an overbite. 

I suffer from this and right now I'm looking into treatments and possibly surgery. Maybe you do as well.",kaqkco,34,0.97,17,2020-12-10 23:37:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/kaqkco/look_into_your_sleep_you_may_have_sleep_apnea_and/,False,False,2020,12

After a few days on this combo with good regular sleep and of course excercise and lots of water and good diet, i always have beeter dreams, better memory better energy.  


Hope this helps all you brain fog sufferers. To me i think it simply comes down to a lack of serotonin resulting in bad dreamless sleep resulting in fog.",kfw5hs,30,1.0,36,2020-12-18 23:16:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/kfw5hs/how_i_cured_my_brain_fog/,False,False,2020,12

I’ve been having brain fog for almost a year now. I used to be a very good student, and now because of these symptoms I am just unable to think, understand or remembrer properly.

21,Brainfog for 6 1/2 month and going: My journey so far,"Hello my fellow foggers,

I want to write down my path so far to get feedback from you, or just to document it for the future to look back if i solve my brainfog and be happy that its gone.  I will first describe how it all started, then i will describe my symptoms, then document my excluded causes and finally I will describe the upcoming tests I plan to take.

About me: I am male, 25, from germany and did before corona a lot of sports. I ate more or less healthy (waaay to much protein, said my doctor after the blood test came back). Before the fog i started my master thesis.

**How it started**

The symptoms started after two important events in my opinion. The first was a water transfer print that I did on May 22nd (in my bathroom, not much ventilation, no respiratory protection, work with varnish). One days later I went on a bike tour with my friends and drank a lot (the tour was also very long, about 6 hours, so my neck was strained). The next day, Sunday, I had migraines (that's not uncommon for me, I get them every few months). On Monday I noticed that I couldn't fully concentrate on my work and also that I didn't see well (a flicker in front of my eyes). While I initially put this on the migraine, the symptoms persisted a week later (constant). Sometimes the Brainfog is very strong and sometimes a little less, but it has never left me since then.

&#x200B;

**Symptoms**

* Bad Vision (constant, but gets better at evening)
   * flicker in front of my eyes
   * photosensitivity
* Brainfog (constant, but gets better at evening. i also noticed that it gets worse in stressful situations)
   * Poor memory
   * cant concentrate
   * reading is hard
   * it feels like someone poured honey in my head. i feel so slow when it comes to thinking
* Neck pain
   * Since then my Neck hurts and is stiff (directly under my head if it makes sense)
   * it does cracking sounds if i move it in my ear
* Heart  (sometimes, so i dont know if im just anxious)
   * i hear my heart when i'm lying down. in the morning I notice that the heart rate fluctuates strongly and stumbles (even sometimes during the day)
* Jaw (sometimes)
   * cramped ( I often notice it when I'm on the move)
   * cracking noise (especially in the morning, but also when i chew sth or open my mouth)
* Handy, Legs, Jaw
   * sometimes they get shaky (my jaw alls the time, but my hands and legs just sometimes).  My fine motor skills are then impaired. Only when I move them they tremble. I noticed that i cramp my hands at night and the shakyness often start in the morning when i wake up.
* cold sensitive (but its winter, so duh...)
* sometimes tinnitus

&#x200B;

**Excluded causes aka what i tried so far**

* Tests
   * MRI head
   * MRI cervical spine
   * CT sinuses
   * blood test (B12, B6) --> They found waaay to high B12 because of my Energy Drink consumption
   * got eyes checked
   * got sinuses checked
   * got  balance nerves  checked
   * got neck checked
   * got teeth checked (TMJ is diagnosed, but its expensive so i havent tried this yet)
   * long term ekg
   * EEG
   * xray of my neck
   * test for Lyme disease
   * test for corona anti bodies

&#x200B;

* What i tried
   * 12 physiotherapy sessions  (the neck pain stayed, even directly after the session but it got a little better) --> No fog change
   * 2 x osteopath (searched for blockades, realigned my atlas.) --> No fog change
   * took Vitamins (Magnesium, B12, B6, Vitamin D etc) --> No fog change
   * bought a neck pillow and  acupressure mat  --> No fog change
   * Candida (drank kefir all day and all of this stuff)  --> No fog change
* What i am currently trying
   * posture exercises --> No fog change or neck pain change so far. But its free, so i will keep doing it
   * psychotherapy --> my therapist is 100% sure it's some kind of hypochondria. I am willing to try this... (2 weeks in so far, he says i am not ready to get better yet)
* What  i will look into in the following months
   * Sleep Apnea --> test is scheduled end of the year (i snore a lot)
   * TMJ --> diagnosed, but tbh i dont think this will help
   * go  to dentist, because one tooth is cold sensistive and hurts if i clench my jaw
   * check for chronic hyperventilation (scheduled for january)
   * allergies --> i have an allergy (house dust), so i will make another test to see if it got worse the last few years --> also scheduled january
   * one more time i will go to a  neurologist to check this shaking hand thing. the first one said its perfectly normal. Especially because it started after i did this water transfer print  stuff --> december14th
   * maybe cardiologist? but the waiting is so long (earliest meeting i would get is september)

&#x200B;

If this doesnt help, and if noone can give me some new input i am willing to think it has to be psychological. I mean...it has to be sth and everything that is possible for me in my opinion is listed here .

Dont give up my friends, we can do this! Help or opinions would be much appreciated ♥",k93zjo,17,0.85,31,2020-12-08 13:17:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/k93zjo/brainfog_for_6_12_month_and_going_my_journey_so/,False,False,2020,12

3,Brain fog cleared 100% - check my previous post,"Hi all,

After having brain fog since September 2020, I have completely healed.

The final diagnosis/solution was:

1. Upper airway resistance syndrome (did a septoplasty, upper turbinate/tonsil/UPPP reduction surgery)
2. Vitamin D deficiencies 
3. Celery Juice (500ml) every morning on an empty stomach

Advice to all:

Apart from the conventional checks, which was listed in my previous post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/k368he/finally\_found\_the\_cause\_of\_my\_brain\_fog\_uarssleep/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/k368he/finally_found_the_cause_of_my_brain_fog_uarssleep/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Start consuming Celery Juice - it really helps. It changed my life. And there is no downside. Clears toxins, fights inflammation, heals the gut, anti-chronic diseases. I gave it a swing 6 weeks ago, was quite doubtful over this initially, but it did wonders. Energy levels went up and sleep improved.

6,"Brain fog has confiscated my dreams and the personality that I had in my possession, I don’t recognize myself any longer and it devastates me.","Hello everyone,

I’ve been reading a lot of the post from other participants and I have to say that I’m a little relieved to have the reassurance that I’m not going ballistic and that others are experiencing comparable situations that correlate with each other.

However I just wanted to give an explanation and elaborate about the circumstances that I tend to be affiliated with, once this pandemic has started I noticed some remarkable changes but they weren’t concerning around the time. 

It basically began with small changes in my behavior, nothing to be concerned about just a little more irritated when people were demanding a lot from me, so practically you can refer to it as a burn-out. 

But after the summer everything became unbearable and I was convinced that something was wrong with me, I even had to file a cancellation for college considering the fact that I was unable to function like I usually did. Even the courses I used to excel at (like English for example) were becoming challenging and I didn’t comprehend why I couldn’t make my assignments anymore.

And even when we had our last gathering for our final arrangements I struggled to articulate myself, usually words just come to me without having to force myself or without contemplation. 

But right now even a simple conversation that isn’t sophisticated or complex are difficult to understand. Because of this I deliberately isolated myself from my friends and even my boyfriend at the worst days, and it destructs me knowing that I’m not responsible for this. But yet I can’t submit myself to people or anything anymore, my desire to execute has just diminished with each day. And everyday I feel more lost and unintelligent, as if I have an IQ of 50. 

I used to have a blog where I wrote compelling and complex narratives every month, but right now when I read them once again I can’t understand how I had the ability to create them in the first place. Or what they precisely entail, such a strange experience.

Since those occurrences have been taking place I started to have multiple breakdowns, at the worst cases I could lay in bed consistently without any communication or productivity.

Sometimes I try to watch documentaries with fascinating stories, but even that hurts my brain to the core that I’m not willing to continue it. It’s devastating to say the least, I just want to experience life again and pursue my education again. It’s disappointing that I had to end school because of these horrendous issues with my memory. 

I don’t feel reliable anymore, as if my perception of life and everything that has an involvement with it has been demolished, nothing is comprehensive any more. 

Everything confused me even the things that I have a particular attachment with, either emotionally or intellectually. 

At some points I wouldn’t even be able to write this, but fortunately my writing hasn’t been affected completely but it’s just takes a greater effort to do things, especially in terms of socializing and interacting. Texting seems to be passable but I tend to forget some vocabulary sometimes. But my grammar is embarrassingly atrocious since I had brain fog, or whatever this may be. 

I kept investigating this condition for approximately 5 months since the summer, and the fact that doctors are not taking it seriously does not provide any help either. 

They all have the assumption that I possibly have a severe kind of depression, but they are not going to treat me until February. This seems to be a problematic issue in the Netherlands right now, everything is being procrastinated and my brain is only destructing with each day.

I can’t continue to live my life like this, I want to be there for my loved ones. I want to surround myself with the people I admire, I want to go to college again and establish my dreams. I want to have sentimental moments with my boyfriend again. But it all seems to be unrealistic at this point and I’m scared that my brain may have  permanent complications. 

But the “old me” has disappeared, the delightful considerate and understanding version of me does no longer exists. 

Anyone feeling like this? Or has it affected anyone’s life to this extend? 

Don’t hesitate to share your experiences underneath! And my sincere apologies if my English is not as good as it used to be, my brain fog has decreased my talents in every department.",kspbz6,42,0.99,16,2021-01-07 23:08:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/kspbz6/brain_fog_has_confiscated_my_dreams_and_the/,False,False,2021,1
7,"So I watched ""HEAL"" on Netflix...","I watched this documentary that everyone's been ranting and raving about, and a lot of it is scientifically accurate, some of it is not (mediums and certain other tidbits) but overall, mind over matter is a very well-studied and real phenomenon. Everyone on this sub should give it a watch. 

After reading Dr. Robert Zapolsky's book 'Why Zebras don't get Ulcers' it just confirms a lot of that too (which is most of the science that ""HEAL"" is based off of), and the book has a lot more objective science on these issues.

However, as a result, even though I've been a part of this community for about 3 years now, I have decided to leave. All it does is make it worse, and introducing thoughts I can't utilize to heal. 

After Watching the doc, I actually meditated for the first time, and it was amazing. I honestly think that the 75% of the movie that is accurate, changed my life. 

I invite all of you to watch the documentary, and attempt to read that book. Dr. Zapolsky is a leading scientist in psychology (especially the effects of stress on chronic illness) so don't discount him, he's leaps and bounds more intelligent than anyone in the film, but I can understand if some of you may not be able to read the book (he actually does a great job of making easy for the layman to understand. 

But yeah. Y'all are gonna heal, and I am too. But staying on this sub continues to produce negative thought processes for me, and I can't have that anymore. I invite you to do what is ever best for you, but this is what's best for me. I am glad to have served and supported y'all, and extremely grateful for those who've done the same for me.

9,Your thyroid may be a contributing cause of brain fog,"As much as I think brain fog (ie brain inflammation) is caused mainly by either food sensitivities (especially gluten) or chronic virus, there are some other contributing factors. One of these is hypothyroidism.

Try testing your TSH and be aware that the intervals usually reported on labs test are way too broad and it's been proven they are incorrect. Your TSH ideally should be between 0.5 to 1,5. Ideally you should get a full thyroid panel with free T3, T4, reverse T3 and thyroid antibodies.

I have it a 2,76 (had it at over 3,5 before) and it's high, and my symptoms get worse the higher (ie the most hypothyroid) it gets. Many people report less brain fog and much more energy when their TSH is around 1 or even lower.

Women are much more likely to have Hashimoto than men because estrogens (and things like birth control pill) raise the risk but men too can have hypothyroidism especially if they take drugs that somehow convert to estrogen (like finasteride) or simply because they have a genetic predisposition",l3qran,31,1.0,6,2021-01-24 02:44:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/l3qran/your_thyroid_may_be_a_contributing_cause_of_brain/,False,False,2021,1
10,My diagnosis...,"So I posted on this page maybe a week ago—sharing my history with brain fog and how it hurt my day-to-day living. Turns out, my brain fog has always been from a side effect of Labrynthitis. Aka, swelling and inflammation of the inner ear. 

Unfortunately while I have been diagnosed, I do have to make some life changes to avoid having it come back in the future. I have had many attacks of Labrynthitis due to binge drinking large portions of alcohol during holidays or social events... so, I’m no longer able to drink alcohol at my own leisure. (Alcohol can change the fluid in your ears, thus causing the dizziness, disorientation, confusion.) I’m also required to wear ear coverings during the winter to prevent the cold air from penetrating my ear. 

If you have brain fog, please do yourself a favor and have the doctor check your ears. Labrynthitis is almost always painless and you can’t tell you have an “earache” ... it’s not the usual achey sharp pain of a regular earache.

13,Does anyone worry that their symptoms are more sinister? Or is this health anxiety?,"I was recently diagnosed with some issues with my neck through a neck MRI: Minor spondylosis and osteochondrosis with emphasis on C5/C7, a flat disc protusion C5/C6 and discogenic spinal stenosis C6/C7). I have started to work with a physiotherapist for all of this. Over the month or so though, I have started to feel really dizzy/lightheaded on and off all day long (this started before my physiotherapy sessions), as well as experiencing sinus pressure/tingling around my face for the last year or so (I do not have a sinus infection - I had a CT scan that showed no infection) and a general brain fog which makes me feel like I am somehow disassociated and not quite ""present"". The dizziness and brain fog seems to lift as the day goes on and is often much better by the evening. I have near constant neck ache and it cracks/pops/shifts constantly throughout the day. I am wondering if the disc issue is causing a contraction of a blood vessel and also pressing on a nerve connected to my face which causes the tingling/sinus pressure feeling, as well as the dizziness. I sometimes also experience a weak left hand, especially in my little finger, and holding a cup of coffee, for example, feels weird, as well as some balance issues when walking. I made the fatal mistake of Googling ""brain tumour symptoms"" today and well, here I am. Does anyone else get really anxious about their symptoms?",krobay,25,1.0,20,2021-01-06 13:56:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/krobay/does_anyone_worry_that_their_symptoms_are_more/,False,False,2021,1
14,Has anyone worked on posture to help relieve brainfog?,"25m. Im currently working on my forward neck and rounded shoulders which Im certain have contributed to my brain fog and symptoms. My worst symptoms are, brainfog, memory issues, tension/ tightness around head, fuzzy vision, tinnitus, heart beat in ears and also fatigue!  


I did some chin tucks and some upper back exercises and also some atlas rotation exercises. I felt a bit spaced out and dizzy after it all. But about an hour after when laying in bed the tension around my head reduced and my breathing felt so much clearer and easier! I felt less anxious and relaxed.  


Noticed the tightness in my neck muscles reduced and I could finally feel the bones in my neck which I couldn't before because my neck muscles were that tight! The brain fog didnt improve, but I feel like over the years my posture and slouching behind computers and cameras has really amplified my symptoms.  


I had a head injury when I was younger around 12, think thats what knocked my atlas bone at the top of my neck slightly out and I had mild brain fog in school and hyperhidrosis. So I think with my posture getting worse, the classic nerd neck. I lost my curve, my shoulders moved forward straining my neck more and more over the years. Causing my symptoms to get worse.

I am going to see a Upper Cervical Chiropractor or try AtlasPROfilax to help my Atlas go back into its normal position and heal up. But from research you still have to put in the work to correct the posture and neck by working the weakened muscles so everything can balance out. So cant just rely on chiropractic adjustments if you have neck or posture issues.

16,Am I REALLY TRULY motivated enough to defeat brain fog?,"I’ve suffered with brain fog.  I hated life.  I felt worthless.  I couldn’t laugh.  I became dull, and I knew it.  This generated a downward spiral of depressing thoughts.  Sometimes even suicidal.  You know the symptoms of brain fog are depressing AF.  You have to do something about this.  I did!  

Just to help your journey of recovery:  B12 and D3 really help.  There are different types of brain fog.  I can only speak to those whose brain fog stems from their gut.  My brain fog was gut related.  Leaky gut syndrome.  So take b12 and d3.  

This last section is motivation related...  You need to get your shit together.  Right now.  You can’t live with brain fog and you know it.  Your brain fog has to go.  If you’re anything like me, than you have a sneaky suspicion that your brain fog stems from your gut, what you’re eating, cause you’re constantly bloated and have a bad relationship with food.  So if you’re anything like me, and this is speaking to you, then get your shit together!  Right now!  Stop eating for flavor.  Stop eating for taste.  Stop putting shit in your mouth cause you’re used to it and you’ve always ate like that.  

Only eat for nutrition.  Only.  Should I say it again.  

Do you even understand:
What foods cause inflammation?  What foods cause a leaky gut?  How your body gets energy from food?  An alkaline diet?  PH foods?  Carbs and Keto and ketosis?  Intermittent fasting?  Leaky gut syndrome.  Plant paradox by Steven Gundry?  Just a few topics to get you started in understand.

You probably think you’re eating healthy, but you’re not.  You’re far from it.  You’re so far from it that your body is working so hard to heal your gut that you can’t even think.  You have no energy to think or create because of how you’re eating.  You’re ZERO percent of a healthy diet.  ZERO.  

I want you to say one thing to yourself: I can’t live with brain fog any Fn longer!!  

Get yourself a coach.  A mentor.  YouTube adviser.  I don’t care where you start.  Follow the right people on Yputube.  Engage in these videos that make you healthy again.  Hit the gym for Christ’s sakes.  Run 3 miles 4 times per week.  

You think life is long and hard.  It’s not.  It’s short.  Don’t waste it by thinking your brain fog will magically go away.  It won’t.  You have to will it.  You have to make it happen.  You have to destroy brain fog.  You have to bury it.  You have to call it a shrimp that won’t stand a chance.  You have to murder it.  FN slay it!!!  

Don’t watch TV.  Stop masturbating (yes, I believe this too contributes to brain fog).  Put all efforts in to being the master of your own life instead of a sedentary slave. 

Read.  I mean really read.  Buy books.  There’s an app on your iPhone, you know about this, right?  Read and educate yourself.  Put what you’ve read in to action.  Don’t worry about the cost of anything.  Get out of your brain fog.  It’s slowly killing you anyways.  Death by a thousand cuts.  And it makes you feel worthless.  

So get up.  Write out your plan.  Now.  Do it.  Promise yourself.  Stick with it.  Be a champion.  Train.  Learn.  Push.  Everyday.  Hard.  Even harder.  

For the next 3 months, only focus on how to bring your body and mind to its full optimal potential of health.  Nothing more.  Put everything you have in to this.  Learn this skill so you can carry it thru your whole life.  

And then...  When your brain fog slowly lifts away, and you feel the clarity come back, and you feel your awesome personality return and it makes you so happy you want to dance...  Then please pass this motivational message along to help others.  

Now, Get off your ass and stop being a little b*  It’s go time.  

And this is my story of my mental attitude I had with myself before I defeated brain fog.  Thanks for reading.",kys00o,21,0.78,2,2021-01-16 21:36:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/kys00o/am_i_really_truly_motivated_enough_to_defeat/,False,False,2021,1

Last year one of my weed smoking session was so intense i got a pannick attack and felt much dumber. Since then:

-It feels like using 20% of my brain potential no matter how much i focus. 

-There is no getting through the fog moments now. 

-My thoughts now are walking and stopping often before the target. In a healthy mind they usually run at least.

-I connect facts much slower or i dont, usually im close to being blank

-Almost no original thoughts 

To sum up i feel like having lost 30 iq 

Multiple meds make it worse for some time: nootropics, probiotics

Whats more antibiotics made it worse longertm so far

21,Brain fog for four years,"I can't go into much detail on this now as I've not prepared myself to fully explain my story. Just now, I opened a direct message from a Redditor who read a reply I sent on an AMA last month. The AMA was from somebody who experienced a TBI after surgery a couple of years ago. 

I took the opportunity to talk about my own experiences with mental fogginess and cognative impairment with somebody going through something similar, albeit on a much more severe scale. 

Long story short, since 2016 I've been experiencing varying degrees of what I've perceived as brain fog and mental impairment. I was 16 when it started to show itself and since then I've always felt like a lesser person. At least mentally. It's not something the people around me have ever noticed. But to myself I feel slower and duller. I struggle finding the right words to describe myself and other things, something I'm dealing with as a write this. Occasionally I'll have bursts of increased mental capabilities where I'm more articulate and witty. This is usually when I'm around other people. It's almost like a front I put on. 

I'm glad there's a community where I can relay and discuss my experiences and feelings. I hope others here can understand and relate to what I've been going though and I don't come off as some crazy hypochondriac. Something I've recently suspected as culprit behind my issue is my mother was recently diagnosed with sleep apnea. It's unlikely to be hereditary but it might be worth getting myself checked out. Of course, with the current global crisis it's been a struggle trying to get a doctor's appointment.

0,I want to feel again; more than anything.,"I wouldn’t be surprised if a fair amount of people on here had run-ins with depression, or other mental health issues. But, having experienced all of that before the fog, I’m struck by how different of a sensation this is. It’s like my ability to feel, and derive pleasure from things is much more simplistic. It’s not that I can’t feel, but there’s so little depth anymore that it makes everything feel flat. I’ve went from someone who was deeply passionate about art, history, films, to someone who lacks both curiosity, and the ability to see, and feel the same things I once did.

The only other thing I’d have to add, is that the fog makes it difficult to both ascribe meaning or derive it. It’s no longer intuitive; I’ll have a lot of moments of looking at things I wrote, or things someone else wrote, and it’ll feels like gibberish. I know it’s not, but, just things don’t make sense anymore. I wish they could, but, I’m unsure if they ever will again unless there’s some means of ending, or treating this state.",ljz23m,89,1.0,18,2021-02-14 22:30:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/ljz23m/i_want_to_feel_again_more_than_anything/,False,False,2021,2

1. Hypothyroid: if your thyroid is under active it can result in severe brainfog symptoms among others such as cold limbs, fatigue, high cholesterol, brittle nails and difficulty losing weight. You can ask your doctor for a thyroid blood test to determine if you have this condition.

2. Magnesium deficiency: a deficiency in magnesium can lead to brainfog and anxiety symptoms. Magnesium supplements can resolve this issue. A blood test from a doctor can confirm this diagnosis.

14,Road to recovery from BRAIN FOG,"I dont have much time tonight but I always said I’d come in here and share my story because I used to come in here everyday looking for answers absolutely miserable....

I live in California & I know this may be different for people depending on your location but here are my suggestions 

#1 GO TO A “FUNCTIONAL DR” that is willing to run labs that a conventional dr wouldn’t. Google “functional dr” and the work they do. A functional dr will evaluate you and order labs based off your evaluation. Their sole purpose is to find the imbalances in your body and help you correct them through diet , nutrition and supplements if needed. Imbalances like ( heavy metals, your gut balance, bacteria’s, parasites, food sensativies & a deep breakdown of blood samples ) I’d also suggest doing your own research through podcast, books and YouTube for other functional Drs. An AMAZING starting point is DR MARK HYMAN “the ultra mind solution” book / audio book

#2 FIX YOUR GUT . Everything we put in our body impacts our brain health directly through our gut health . This is going to go hand in hand with finding a functional, holistic or naturopath dr. 

#3 ELIMINATE toxins causing imbalances in your body. A good starting point for me to just learn about toxins was “Cleanse to heal” by Anthony Williams . My purpose in reading his book was to solely gain education on toxins and he delivers. I will say, I’m indecisive on how I feel about his source he gives credit to. However the education in this book about toxins is extremely informative. I’m sure there are others out there but this was one of my starting points. He does discuss a cleanse and I do not suggest doing this cleanse without being under the care of a dr. I did it myself and my body wasn’t prepared for it. It ended up making me worse. 

#4 Take care of your oral health issues . Make sure you don’t have any toxins in them ( mercury fillings ) , infected root canals ect. The best way of going about this is through a biological dentist. I’ll post the link to how to find one in your area tomorrow. “Cure tooth decay” by Ramiel Nagel is a game changer . 


I had brain fog every single day for 1 year. I know it’s not much time compared to some of you others but it was heavy enough that I often contemplated if I could make it another day. I would forget my kids age, the day, what i was doing in a room, what i did yesterday, what i was doing after.. you name it. I had head pressure, brain fog, food sensativies ( tingling and numbness), frequent ruination & blurred vision and light sensitivity. In my case I had damaged my gut from antibiotics and a lifetime of poor diet and lifestyle. I didn’t have a diagnosed health issue from a conventional dr but I had TONS of imbalances proven in lab work from my functional dr. I have been on my road to healing for almost a year now. I’m still far from healed but I’m finally starting to see light through the darkness. For me, it wasn’t an overnight fix snd everyday I have to be disciplined . For me, my healing is all natural so it’s taking time but it’s progress.

3. I can’t focus & concentrate
4. I have a blurry vision
5. I have no time perception. 2 hours feel like 5 minutes
6. Things that have happened yesterday feel like they have happened 6 months ago
7. Something I did 30 minutes ago feels like I did it 3 weeks ago. 


I literally feel like a Zombie. I just live. I wake up, I eat, and I fall asleep. I don’t enjoy anything at all. I feel numb. 

Now, 30 days ago I decided to start a Keto diet. Now, I have good news and bad news as well. The bad news is that nothing from the things I listed above WENT AWAY. I feel exactly as I did a month ago. 

The good news: my brain started processing some things differently. For example I started to have kind of more feelings. That numb feeling decreased for like 15%. When I eat something and I smell the food, my brain remembers I ate the same thing years ago and brings back that memory. I didn’t have this for about 2 years now. 

After Keto, I am planning to start the carnivore diet since I really believe that could help me. Otherwise, I’d rather die than live like this and I really mean it.

20,A rant. Apologies.,"Hi guys and girls,

I just discovered this sub and I feel like I've finally found a group of people that understand.

I (28 M) have been suffering from brain fog for around 6 - 7 years that is only getting worse. Last year I finally went to the Doctors, had blood tests which found nothing outside of Vitamin D deficiency, even managed to get a referral for an MRI scan but everything looks fine. 

The brain fog kicks off anytime I try to focus and is flaring up even while I write this. The trigger need not be reading/writing -- new social situations, conversations with people I'm comfortable with,  exercise, lack of sleep (although I mostly sleep quite well), sleeping with my phone by my pillow, or no trigger at all. It is most extreme after a carb heavy lunch (always lunch).

Currently, I'm trying to finish my Masters degree and managed to get through all the courses without it affecting me too much. But since I started to write my dissertation it has been debilitating. Anticipating the brain fog is enough to make me procrastinate. When I do overcome that barrier and work, the pain can be unbearable. I can't think, processing information takes forever, I frequently forget words (couldn't remember 'debilitating' writing this) and concepts, can't connect concepts, I  forget the previous sentence of the book I'm reading.

I can't describe the sensation itself. It's not a headache. I describe it as a 'brain ache' but that sounds ridiculous to anyone who hears it. The location is sometimes the right hemisphere, sometimes left, temples, or just all over.

I'm losing my cognitive abilities. It's ruining my life. I'm embarrassed to say how long I've been trying to finish my dissertation.

Do I accept this is who I will be forever?

Thanks for listening.",lp4nd8,24,1.0,8,2021-02-21 19:34:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/lp4nd8/a_rant_apologies/,False,False,2021,2
21,"My neck clicks, cracks and shakes. Anyone else?","I'm almost 100 % sure my brainfog is caused by some neck/posture issue. My neck just feels really instable. It doesn't shake like crazy but it feels like I don't have full control of my head movements. Also it clicks and cracks all the time. It feels like it's out of its place and tries to align by clicking. When I'm under stress or even a little bit anxious these symptoms go really bad. My neck tenses up and I have hard time moving my head from side to side cuz otherwise it would tremble like crazy. It's really frustrating in school. When the teacher is in the other side of the classroom and you try to keep your head still without any vertical movement. So I have to rotate my whole body to look at that direction where the teacher is. Also I have vision problems and sometimes difficulty walking (my legs tense up).

24,"20 years old, severe brain fog, and my thoughts","I'm 20, have been aware of my symptoms since age 14, and officially been battling with it for 3 years. Yes, brain fog sucks, especially suck for someone who got this disease early like me. I used to be a sharp student with a good memory, and out of a sudden, these conditions pop in and consume most of my ability. Three months ago, the disease somehow suddenly spiked up, those days I simply just mutter words, not even in a full sentence, my dad looked at me and wanted to help, but his eyes are hopeless and his voice could only say ""What can I help you"", in a sorrow voice. I felt very miserable at that time. But it still wasn't my peak feeling of misery. Two weeks later, I volunteered with my collegemates at a children with intellectual disabilities school. I looked at them and felt that I just acted clumsily no different to them. I was in a huge crisis that week, I locked myself in the room and cried every night. But then I saw some videos about people who have cerebral paralysis, significant disabilities, or tetraplegia (complete paralysis from the bottom neck), they still manage to achieve something for themself. At that point, I wonder why I’m self-digging in the negative thoughts, because I know eventually brain fog (with the right treatment for the right person) is treatable.

I decide to live with it, it doesn't mean I give up, but I try to persuade myself that ""I don't do things slower, I learn things slower""; I try to deviate myself from comparing to others and focuses on the positive side of progression. It makes me feel more comfortable. In the meantime, I continue searching for answers about the origin of my condition. 

**About my conditions & past situations:**

\- Blurred vision, very slow logical-thinking, bad memory, clumsy, low energy. 

\- I had a severe septum deviation. Had surgery. I took my sleep test and it's normal (3.4 HPI)

\- I don't smoke or use drugs.

\- I have been using antidepressants for about 3 years.  

**About my coping strategy:**

\- The most notable one, as I think it's very helpful for me, is that keeping my mind a little busy with new things (skills, knowledge, activities). If you like music, learn guitar or singing). If you like coding, try some…. 

\- For supplements, daily, I take 2 omega-3 pills (from CVS), a Centrum multivitamin pill, and an ashwagandha. Omega 3 is good for the brain (since 60% of the brain is made of fat) and ashwagandha ensures my testosterone to be stable.

\- I work out 4-6 times a week. Working out doesn't solve all of my problems, but every time after the workout, I feel great and better a bit on my concentration. I'm sure you can experience that too! Sometimes, I tried to do some fun challenges like ""Doing 100 push-ups or pull-ups in 30 days"".

\- I cook food for my breakfast and lunch. This week I don't do it (just being lazy after our Lunar New Year - Tết), but I will get back on track soon.

\- I have a bi-monthly check with my neurological doctor to ensure that it isn't from some niche brain disorders or neurodegenerative diseases. 

\- As experiencing this, most times I'm very forgettable, so I make a to-do-list and an online calendar to keep reminding myself.

**Overall**, I do see the improvement of my brain fog after consistently applying those strategies, although at a very slow but gradual pace.

25,Leaving this subreddit for now-- will come back with good news (TLDR ALERT),"Hi y'all,

Been in this subreddit for two or three years, it first gave me a sense of hope that there are others just like me and healing is possible. I've suffered severe/chronic brain fog for 5+ years now and it has been the single most difficult thing I've ever dealt, deteriorating every aspect of my life. The most difficult thing with brain fog, as you all know, is that it is a symptom of various potential causes and it is difficult to pinpoint to what is causing it exactly.  I tried many things from diet, exercise, supplements, accupuncture & Asian medicine, etc., but haven't found the solution yet, mostly because I didn't have the perseverance to do anything consistently for at least few months. I would try one thing and it would help me slightly, then I would grow disappointed and prematurely give up before seeing any effects. 

But luckily I believe I at least narrowed down the possible causes, the main ones being long-term addiction to porn/masturbation, neck/jaw misalignment and bad posture, negative thought patterns and life habits. And what I am glad and thankful about is that due to this condition I started caring more about these aspects of my life I would have otherwise neglected all my life.

The reason I decided to leave this subreddit temporarily is because I realized that I am thinking about my condition 24/7. While I'm driving I'm thinking why my brain feels so heavy and foggy, and every time I make a mistake or am not performing as well as I want to, I would link it back to my brain fog. I came upon a source that by thinking and worrying so much, it would actually make our muscles contract and tense more, worsening the part of body we are so in worry about. I completely agree to this, which is why I have been consciously trying to care less about my condition. Starting work and school again helped in this.

Also I decided to give professional medicine a chance again. These 5+ years I thought I could fix myself and avoided professional help due to cynicism against it, but realized it is all vanity and there are many who got better from it. I'm going to an upper cervical chiropractic again and will receive regular treatment. Whether it is the cause of my brain fog or not, I know it will help me get better anyway. After treatment if my brain fog doesn't improve, I will meet a psychiatrist/therapist.

That is all, thank you for reading this long post, and thank you all for keep thriving to defeat your brain fog and help the community. I will come back when I am completely healed from it, and will come back to share good news for everyone.",lbzmqr,20,1.0,7,2021-02-03 22:03:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/lbzmqr/leaving_this_subreddit_for_now_will_come_back/,False,False,2021,2

3,"Depression might be the main cause of your brain fog, don’t underestimate mental disorders!","Hey everyone,

I don’t know if this should be considered as a question or a “personal story” but I just wanted to make one confession that might be useful to other individuals in this community, yesterday was one of those days were I barely experienced the symptoms I’ve dealing with for approximately 1 year. I managed to go outside and I was not consistently ascertaining things and trying to figure everything out (might be a result of my severe anxiety) and it was actually bearable to have a conversation with my friends about anything and the words are starting to “reappear” again which initially was not the case, everyday was consisting out of emptiness and thoughts that aren’t finalized because I couldn’t properly contemplate about anything. 

I am acknowledged that I might have depression and it’s has been very severe, one thing that a lot of people tend to underestimate is how severe depression can also contribute to concentration problems and even can make you feel physically exhausted to a point that you don’t want to execute anything, the “stereotypical” perception of depression does not showcase everything and not everyone can maintain jobs, studies, relationships and other responsibilities while going through this horrendous condition. 

So if you never had the assumption that you might have any mental disorders or complications you might consider investigating and targeting that issue as well, especially when you’ve had a history with disorders or when you have the awareness that it might be an underlying issue, in my case I was aware that I had ADD but it has never gotten this disastrous and I just didn’t know how to negotiate with it at first, but due to the fact that I’m also having therapy sessions, I have an understanding that these issues surrounding my health are mainly caused by my depression and that makes me feel a little more delighted, knowing that it is the issue we need to target and treat. 

Especially because I’ve been searching for answers for such an enduring time, it at least makes me feel a little accomplished knowing that this might all end soon, and I noticed a remarkable difference in my behavior and I’m recognizing the “old fascinating” person I initially was because I didn’t permit myself to be submissive towards this problematic issue, but rather trying to appreciate all the little things that are still manageable and from there excel further by “persuading” the brain in being more productive which will result into a more capable and comprehensive brain.

I know that this might be “one day of clarity”, but I technically had these moments quite frequently so I’m assured that this will not be sustainable and it’s just a matter of time, regardless of how this might take I’m still so appreciative that my life is heading to another direction and I at least don’t want to remain indoors for the rest of my life anymore and I‘m more eager to go outside to go for a walk and I’m writing more in my journal than I did at first, and yesterday I was also able to read 10 pages out of a book within a matter of 30 minutes! 

But this occurrence would never take place if it wasn’t for my empowering and encouraging friends that have endorsed me during these complicated and challenging times, if it wasn’t for them I would not step one feet out of my bed until I decease and rot underneath the ground, they convinced me every day that this is just a matter of time and that I need to give myself the entitlement to heal and grow and that my achievements will return as soon as it’s getting better. 

Might not have a job or I might not go to college at this moment because I still want to establish health, but this showcases that nothing has to be a “settlement” unless you’re allowing yourself to be settled in it! 

So I want to give you guys one small recommendation, don’t dispatch the people you’re sentimentally attached to and those that have supported you for the longest. 

Having supportive people in your life can already change your perspective in that regard because they‘ll be there for you even in the worst circumstances, depression has confiscated a lot great things in my life and I was almost contemplating about suicide to a certain point.

But now I at least am aware that I don’t want to commit anything like that, because it will be consequential for the ones I love and I don’t want to frighten them in that way. 

I think my depression has manufactured this “fogginess” in my brain and caused me to barely even be able to think, but regardless of what you’re capable of or not at this moment you’re still an exceptional person with distinctive talents and qualities! It might not be convincing right now but that is what we still consist of underneath all the fog, with all this being said I just wanted to say that we need to hang onto the small and minimalistic things we can execute at this moment and slowly work ourselves up towards the “higher latter” again, this might take time and you might be exhausted which is understandable, but that does not mean that you “earn” to have this to any extent.

Try to hang onto it,

Try to take advantage of this condition and don’t let it have any power over your life, try to investigate the issue that is causing this in general and you’ll discover what this was all along. We’re not deranged or dumb, we’re technically “ill” and this will recover sometime and we need to remain it to experience the accomplishments we will earn afterwards.

I’m sorry if this turned out to be longer than I had in my expectations, but I hope that this can be enlightening for other people. My thoughts are will all of you!

Side note: I see some people saying that the title is “obvious” and that it needs no explanation, I wasn’t trying to confuse anyone but I just wanted to share my experience for other people who are suffering under this, but by no means am I saying that people “don’t know” that it’s coming from mental health issues, the only statement that I wanted to make is that it could be a main contributor. I’m sorry if this was confusing.",mh0uzq,67,0.98,21,2021-03-31 07:42:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/mh0uzq/depression_might_be_the_main_cause_of_your_brain/,False,False,2021,3

5,I'D RATHER DIE THAN KEEP GOING LIKE THIS,"I don't even know where to start. Let's just say that my brain fog is ruining my life. It's like all my functional brain cells are gone and they're all replaced by cotton balls. It's been like this for two years. I don't know if my antidepressants and antipsychotics worsened my brain fog but I already had brain fog even before I was put on meds. I used to be an AcHiEvEr lmao and now I'm dysfunctional, can't think straight, can't process words immediately, can't imagine things, can't finish and do things because it feels like I'm in a daze and I look at the world through a filter, I dissociate a lot, can't speak without stuttering, can't add more information into my brain and having a hard time with my memories, I don't even have dreams at night anymore. Writing and speaking used to be easy for me, in fact I used to be a good communicator when my head was clear, but now I can't do both because my brain refuses to function and be productive. It's like my brain is suspended within a block of ice and my head always feels so heavy. Sometimes I'm having migraines and I feel like dying when the migraines and brain fog occur at once. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so miserable I just wanna die. There is a pile of paperworks to be done but I can't even bring myself to do a single thing because my brain just won't work anymore and I just want to sleep all day because when I'm asleep I can't feel the emptiness within my skull.

It feels like I have dementia at this point. It’s incredibly difficult to even communicate how bad it is because it affects my ability to speak and type.

My speech is slurred like I’m constantly having a stroke and I can’t remember peoples names to save my life sometimes. It feels like I’ve lost 50 IQ points and it just keeps getting worse. I keep misunderstanding what people mean when they say something and just generally messing things up because I don’t get what’s even happening. Just a crazy level of confusion all the time. I try to tell myself that it’s just the brain fog and that it’ll get better as I work on improving my pots but it feels like it’s progressed past that point and now it’s just brain damage of some kind or early onset dementia or something.

10,found out the reason for severe brain fog,"idk how common this is, but ive found out reason now for that disgusting brain fogged awake feeling where you almost feel drunk, i think it has to do with activation of histamine h3 receptor which happens everytime something inflammatory happens from food. It can also happen from something like probiotic (if your body sees the bacteria as a threat). histamine is involved in every immune response and i think this could be reason for many people

“In addition, to regulating the release of histamine, H3 receptor activation has been found to inhibit the release of many other neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA, 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine (Blandina et al., 1996; Brown and Reymann, 1996; Schlicker et al., 1999; Jang et al., 2001;”",mdq0yc,41,0.95,36,2021-03-26 14:36:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/mdq0yc/found_out_the_reason_for_severe_brain_fog/,False,False,2021,3
11,Some brainfog tips that you may not know,"Last week I wrote a comment to a brain fog question. I wanted to share my tips as a separate post too, maybe it will help someone out here. For those who just developed severe brain fog:

* time will help a lot! A lot more than you believe right now. Never give up on work, study, reading, exercise, meditation and having conversations. Your brain will get better again by the practice (neuroplasticity; it felt like learning to walk again after an accident). Time itself will also do it's part to heal you. 
* By ignoring the fog, it gets less power and more important: it becomes less noticeable. Think about it, if you live next to a noisy road, you don’t notice the sound any more after some time. But if you keep paying attention to it it will only get worse (feelings of stress, disappointment and anxiety!) Live your life, ignore the fog, and limit screen use and stress! Use reddit/internet to make a concrete health plan for yourself, after that don't dwell on it any more (hard, I know),
* Wim Hof method, mostly the cold exposure is really nice for brain fog. You will feel alive and more clear minded after cold exposure  r/BecomingTheIceman
* Fasting Increases Levels of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), look it up! It promotes growth of neurons in the brain, the formation and strengthening of synapses and it can increase the production of new nerve cells from stem cells (watch: Why fasting bolsters brain power: Mark Mattson at TEDxJohnsHopkinsUniversity on Youtube). Take it slow and build up a fasting routing. Later, when you are ready for longer fasting periods you will feel clear headed during those extended fasts AND it stimulates long term brain improvement (BDNF). Plus it is healthy in general (if you have enough fat reserve and take your electrolytes on longer fasts). Information can be found at r/fasting r/intermittentfasting r/keto (some people have the same mental clarity on keto as with fasting, but I personally like and need healthy carbs too much) .
* I'm not your doctor, always listen to your doctor, but from my experience: don’t take any supplements that mess with/stimulate/activate your neurotransmitters. Heal them with healthy lifestyle changes. Other supplements like magnesium, vit D, kelp iodine and omega 3 (krill is a clean form) can still be good of course.
* Stop alcohol/drugs. And if in a year or so you find it still bothers you too much: stop all caffeine and added sugar use (not all at the same time, this is a long term project) and be ready every time to feel worse for weeks/months, but probably feel better afterwards. There are testimonials on r/decaf r/sugarfree and other pages, that these lifestyle changes can also impact brain fog in a positive way (less overstimulated neurotransmitters, less inflammation). The moment I stopped focussing on my brain fog and started focussing on becoming healthier was when my brain fog slowly became less severe. 

Sorry to say there is no quick fix in most cases - as far as I know - but it does get better!! I had heavy brain fog/visual snow/depersonalization/tinnitus. The fact that my memory was a mess is great, I don't remember much from the darkest times (joke not appropriate?). All in all, my life is good now, and all those symptoms went from all consuming craziness to background fillers. Pushing myself and not feeling sorry for myself worked well (after grieving the loss of my brainfunction for some weeks first, I'm only human). Lifestyle changes helped a lot too.

17,If this helps anyone... here is my full list of symptoms and (part of) my narrative,"So... comparison can help and it also can make things worst. That being said, discovering this sub a week ago has literally lifted a weight off of my shoulders. I thought I was ""insane"" for the longest time... that there was just something inherently wrong with me. I didn't realize this was something so many people experienced and for so many different reasons, how debilitating it can be, how it has an *actual name*.

I wrote this list for my therapist to understand my confusing brain fog and brain fog-adjacent symptoms. For context, I am 22 and I have been diagnosed with Hashimotos and with trauma-related depression and anxiety. A lot of my symptoms seem to overlap with ADHD symptoms. It's extremely long, but I hope someone can read it and feel what I feel reading other people's posts:

**Brain fog or brain fog-related symptoms**

Notes:

* These are symptoms I’ve *experienced since middle school that developed full force when I was 17* (also notably when I became more depressed and my school performance declined) 
* Symptoms vary daily and can be surpassed, but it’s hard :( This contributed largely to *worsening my depression* through all of school bc I was frustrated and felt like a failure
* I’m just listing what I notice on a regular basis, though I’m sure most of these are multicausal or may go away or are even normal. I think my lifestyle has a lot to do with it, though if I didn’t have these symptoms, I probably wouldn’t be in such a rut :) So it feels very cyclical and unknowable.
* Most of them seem avoidance related… but together it feels like “brain fog” regardless of causes.

 

* **General feeling of “fogginess” or sluggishness**
   * Often makes activities mentally feel like *trudging through mud*

&#x200B;

* **Low motivation**
   * Describe as insurmountable “wall”, causes impairment in all aspects of life e.g. felt towards both enjoyable (hobbies) and unenjoyable things (tasks, work)
   * It’s strange - I *want* to do many things to some level (it's not that I don't care) but I usually don’t have the willpower to actually do them. I find this extremely frustrating. The only thing that “motivates” me is feelings of panic/guilt (aka involves *accountability*) and that doesn’t work anymore. 
   * I’ve noticed that when I start new things, I always eventually hit this “wall”. Creating habits helps, but I usually can’t sustain the momentum. 
   * Usually makes working through the below symptoms more difficult 

&#x200B;

* **Difficulty concentrating, especially for extended periods** 
   * Complicated! *TLDR: My concentration is very all or nothing!*
   * I used to be able to concentrate on enjoyable activities but now I can’t do that either. I can’t multitask effectively and I rapidly switch between activities because nothing holds my attention. 
   * Related to procrastination - studying/homework has always required great mental effort and I usually need to allot 6-8 hours for \~1- 2 hours of work. 
   * I can only concentrate when I’m watching TV/playing video games or when I’m “hyper focused” on something (ADHD term but feels accurate). If I start focusing on something I am obsessive about, like my diagnoses, I can go  uninterrupted for 3-6 hours. 
   * I also can fully focus on boring things like work if I am actively being watched or held accountable (related to fear). That’s why I have been able to write 10 page papers in 8 hours due to panic. However, this causes me to burn out very quickly and I end up shutting down after a period of working. Part of the reason I consistently experience burnout is because I’m afraid of taking breaks for fear of losing focus (it’s always been this way). 

&#x200B;

* **Low endurance for sustained mental effort** 
   * Mental energy or ability to focus feels very easily expended and I quickly feel tired or “spent” - struggling unnecessarily or a matter of willpower?

&#x200B;

* **Difficulty processing information and problem solving**
   * Feelings of a general “slowness” (has always been this way but has gotten worse after age 17) →  comprises large part of general sluggishness I feel
   * Hard to describe except that it feels excessively difficult, prone to become overwhelmed & give up when I try to organize thoughts, perform any type of complex/critical thinking, or retain information
   * Usually feel confused or “can’t follow”
   * Note: I noticed that it’s exceptionally hard for me to process *auditory things* 
   * Tied to poor concentration
      * E.g. It’s very difficult for me to read!! I typically have to reread a passage multiple times to understand it so it takes me much longer to read books or academic readings. 
      * I want to learn but it feels hard. I’ve developed some anxiety around this so I’ve stopped trying to learn anything. 

&#x200B;

* **Memory problems**
   * Short term memory: Feels impaired, often extremely forgetful of all tasks, appointments, even with constant reminders (could just be  avoidance)
   * Long term memory: Difficulty accessing, tend to forget occurrences that were previously meaningful (usually happens with bad memories, so trauma related?)
   * Poor recall

&#x200B;

* **Difficulty organizing and articulating thoughts into words verbally/sometimes written language**
   * Requires great mental effort to do this, also an issue in non-social situations
   * Usually end up feeling jumbled, using the wrong words, forgetting
   * Feels very hard in conversations →  takes the form of speaking slowly, going in circles to explain something, saying the wrong thing, losing my train of thought...

&#x200B;

* **Some trouble with mental visualization**
   * I can moderately visualize most things, mostly related to memory, but I’ve noticed that I can no longer visualize things I want to draw (part of why I stopped drawing). I also have more trouble visualizing when I read books.

&#x200B;

* **Executive dysfunction** (<-- I think I have this, not sure)

&#x200B;

* **Difficulty retaining new information**

&#x200B;

* **Emotional flatness**
   * Fluctuations in emotion, highs and lows, are extremely muted compared to what I remember
   * I can feel but the depth of the emotional experience, e.g. feelings of distress, joy, feel much more simplistic or shallow
   * This is complicated b/c I don’t know how normal this is or if it’s because I’m actively preventing myself from having experiences that would normally cause these feelings - but I think this has been going on for a long time

&#x200B;

* **Sometimes dissociate or feel a general sense of disconnect** 
   * Can be a surreal or dream-like perception, feeling mentally numb.
   * This especially occurs in *social situations or moments of stress but sometimes even happens when I am thinking about something distressing - I will immediately lose my train of thought*. I will often realize I am unable to pay attention because I am trapped in my thoughts and can’t stop it. It’s very hard to hold onto things mentally. 
      * Previously described it as a tendency to “zone out”, become spacey, daydream, be distracted. As a kid, I was told by others that I often seemed like I was zoned out.
   * Sometimes I am still thinking despite what’s occurring around me, other times I am mentally blank.
   * HOWEVER this doesn’t match many symptoms of *depersonalization* (no feelings of being out of my body, no sense that things are not real).

&#x200B;

* **Rumination**
   * Not *really* brain fog-related but it contributes to general sense of confusion 
   * Get into uncontrollable obsessive thought/negative self talk spirals that can go for hours uninterrupted, usually every day
   * Has gotten better with mindfulness and writing 

&#x200B;

* **Feelings of mental paralysis/stasis**
   * Due to many factors, such as:
      * Constant feelings of overwhelm at minor stressors, which causes a “freeze” → procrastination 
      * General feeling of disorientation
      * Short-sighted sense of the future 
      * No real goals or direction (lol)

&#x200B;

* **General feeling like something is wrong with my head or something is not operating normally**
   * Usually say that I feel “crazy” or “stupid” or that my brain is rotting
   * Feels like I’m working at 50-75% capacity

&#x200B;

* **Chronic tension headaches/tension at the top of my head**
   * Tangentially-related but it makes symptoms worse and happens whenever I’m stressed (so \~every day). For example, I get these whenever I journal. 
   * Sometimes feels like my brain is swollen or my head is full of cotton 

&#x200B;

\*To be frank, all of these brain fog symptoms are extremely interwoven with my depression and anxiety symptoms. They’ve had a huge part in damaging my self esteem and affecting my confidence in trying to build relationships or pursue my goals. 

I often feel that others see me as being unintelligent or boring because that’s how I see myself. I struggle to feel interested or motivated, concentrate, retain information, think critically... I’m afraid that when I speak, I will dissociate or lose my grasp on the words. With everyone I meet, old friends and new people, I am worried that I will accidentally drop the facade. I’m constantly afraid people will suddenly notice that I actually have no interests and that I can’t function as well cognitively. They will realize I’m a “fraud” and will see I’m just a shell, with nothing inside (in turn, this affects my ability to decentralize myself and be present). Even today, I can tell it is affecting my performance in my internship because of the story I tell myself - “I’m too stupid to do this. This requires too much effort (and it shouldn't). They will realize I don’t belong here.” ← This thinking has paralyzed me to the point of retreat.

I usually actually redirect it at myself and believe that it’s my fault for not living a life that builds these skills… BUT sometimes, I do have moments of clarity where I cut myself slack and remember it’s not just me feeling this and that I should get help because things can change. Those moments of self-forgiveness were the only times I was able to move forward, like moving to seeing a therapist again!

And that's the entire thing! It certainly helped me to lay everything out and see what I experience objectively.

19,The Night That Changed Everything,"This is a long post but I think it's worth a read.

I wanna know if anyone else has had a similar experience. I was a very optimistic teen who dealt with anxiety but it was controllable. I had a go get em attitude and never struggled to make people laugh and graduated 3.8 gpa ready to conquer the world. However two weeks into college that all fell apart. I've tried so many times to figure out where I went wrong. I remember I had been vaping off and on. I was a bit stressed because of this class I needed to sign up for and I wasn't eating regularly. However none of that was anything I hadn't done before just maybe contributed to the situation. I remember the fateful night clearly. I had finished working on some stand up comedy, drank two kombuchas and ate two dark chocolate bars cuase I'm a dumb college kid, proceeded to pop a melatonin and turned in for the night. 

Well a few hours later I awoke hot and tossing and turning realizing my heart rate was through the roof. I got up and felt really fatigued and out of it. Almost dizzy with head pressure. I tried walking it off, I took a shower, hit the vape but nothing seemed to help. I eventually calmed down enough to sleep. The next morning I felt the same and have pretty much ever since. I couldn't figure it out, which plunged me into panic attacks leading to deep dark depression and derealization/hopelessness. I've just never been the same, my head usually feels lightheaded, dizzy, and head pressure, there's often a pain in my back upper neck and its always itchy too, I obviously have really bad brain fog, I've dealt with tight muscles and weakness, I'm always tired, I have diarrhea every single day which has happened for years but seems worse now, pair that with bloating and heart burn, my heart rate also elevates for no reason and my face and hands feel numb and shakey for no reason. I also have a wack sleep schedule and never seem to wake up feeling rested. I could probably note other things but that's the main stuff. 

All that to say I've been to the doctor many times and had a couple different doctors. I'm on effexor right now and it works wonders for my anxiety and depression but I'm left feeling quite emotionally numb, however when off the meds I can feel numb as well, but its just a different kind. But without the fog I feel id be so much happier and better at processing everything and the numbness would be something tolerable. I'm with a doctor RN that seems keen on helping me figure out what's going on. I've been upping my vitamins and doing some more blood tests. Gonna do no gluten and dairy starting soon. I am not celiac but could have a wheat allergy. 

However I just wanted to see what y'all think and see if anyone relates as its always comforting to read a story and be like ""yep that's me"". So idk maybe I'm the only one but its worth putting it out there. I just wanna feel me again. I wanna talk and listen effortlessly. I wanna have the energy to swim and make jokes. I wanna look at the sunset and feel how amazing it is. I'm tired of feeling grey, tired of feeling doldrum and numb and sleepy. Tired of being so fatigued and achy that I can't even walk up a hill. I wanna feel again, process again, be creative again, I wanna be able to handle stressful situations, do my job well, have motivation and attention, I wanna thrive but until then I guess I'll have to survive. 

To everyone who's read this through, thank you, I really appreciate your time, lmk what you think. I'm not loosing hope and neither should you. There are days where I feel like giving up. 19 having everything stripped from me and having no close family of friends that understand is beyond difficult. It is living hell sometimes. But I pray we all find a cure. And that all this pain will make the day we are fog free so much better.",m8ekj7,32,1.0,16,2021-03-19 10:47:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/m8ekj7/the_night_that_changed_everything/,False,False,2021,3
20,Gluten was my poison,"Hey, guys!

I hope this can help many of you out there.

I suffered from brain fog for two months and I was getting crazy. I tried many different things and was diagnosed as depressant. After two months of no improvement, I decided myself to start a diet based only on rice, chicken and broccoli. After three days the brain fog was gone and never came back.

I'm pretty convinced the culprit is gluten since when I eat any other kind of food I have no symptoms. Now, when I eat gluten-containing food, I get some strange bowel movements but no brain fog. I probably suffer from [NCGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-celiac_gluten_sensitivity) at some degree, I still have to figure it out. Anyway, my diet has been since then almost completely gluten-free.

Hope you'll find also the cause of your brain fog, guys. Don't stop looking for it and stay strong!",m1gio2,33,0.94,13,2021-03-09 21:15:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/m1gio2/gluten_was_my_poison/,False,False,2021,3

22,I want to all be on the same page in terms of the very much generalized word “Brain Fog”. What is the experience like for you (specifically the cognitive aspect of brain fog).,"We say time and time again “brain fog”. However what does it truly feel like. Words are so hard to describe for me what it feels like. 

The best way I can put it is that it feels like i am thinking slower. I can actually FEEL my brain working slower. It truly feels like there is a cloud in my brain.

And it does not come and go. It is persistent, it has been there for 7 consecutive months.

I can feel it mid conversation, when I’m talking to someone and I’m truly struggling to keep up (however I do no show this and I hide it well). 

I feel it all time really when I’m trying to figure out what to do NEXT, planning I think is the word I’m looking for. 

Everything I do is to try to cope with the feeling of this heavy fog that has dampened my mood, motivation, and simply the ability to feel joy in life.

Yet I am staying positive, I’m doing Neurofeedback (to my surprise so far they have been very thorough (however I have not done therapy yet, getting a baseline with exams and bood). I am seeing a wholistic practitioner that looks at EVERYTHING. Genetics, hormones, toxins (such a mercury) deficiency, virus (most common one y’all probably have heard of is Lymes but there is tons of others). And of course gut health.

It is hard, but I am TRYING/FIGHTING to stay positive. I am 25 years of age. 160 pounds, 6 ft tall. Used to be a collegiate athlete. I should be thriving on life, yet I feel a shell of myself when the fog came. That is where the depression comes in. 

In the end, you need to stay positive. Find help, that’s where is starts. And and I can’t say it enough, stay positive.",mehauf,29,0.98,32,2021-03-27 16:34:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/mehauf/i_want_to_all_be_on_the_same_page_in_terms_of_the/,False,False,2021,3

28,How does your (if any) memory deficits affect you?,"In my case, I’m genuinely worried I’ll be unable to recover from, heal, and internalize, things that have happened to me, or just recurring thoughts & behaviors. At least, if the brain fog ends up persisting. 

I can’t remember much, nor can I hold anything reliably in my brain, as far as thinking. So, despite seeing a therapist, it ends up not mattering, as I forget everything we had talked about. I forget any revelations I might’ve had, anything important that could make a difference. it’s like I’m stuck in a loop where I’m continuously and perpetually wounded by the same things over and over again. You’d think writing it down would help, but, it ends up not making much of a difference. I’ll forget about the reminders, and the reminders of the reminders. I’ll forget things that are supposed to help with actually achieving things, thus greatly struggling with the things that I manage remember. It’s deeply ironic, but it sucks being caught in a cycle like that

30,Everything has been taken from me,"I’ve been dealing with my fog about 8-9 months, and it has utterly and completely ruined my life. I haven’t been able to think straight in almost a year, I literally can barely remember what happened yesterday, and I am absolutely 100% completely not present in any situation I’m in.

I sit at my desk at work and just look at the screen without any clue as to what to do. The simplest tasks are difficult for me. My comprehension has dropped to zero. My boss thinks I’m fucking slow in the head, and he’s not far off at this point.

My emotions are gone. My relationship with my girlfriend has completely tanked, things are probably near ending, all because of me. My testosterone and libido have tanked too, and I have no idea how to explain to this poor girl why I’ve seemingly become this detached, dumb, dull person who has almost no ability to connect with her in almost a year. I’ve tried, and I end up feeling bad that she has to be with someone like me. This beautiful, kind, funny, wonderful girl, and I can’t feel shit. 
This one almost hurts the most.

Essentially the only emotion I can feel somewhat strongly is anger. Frustration. I want to cry so fucking badly but I literally cannot.

I’ve been to multiple doctors, tried my hardest to force myself to the next one, just to have each glimmer of hope at a potential cure snuffed out again and again.

This is probably dramatic to read I’m sure. But I want to die, I really do. The apathy this fog gives me is almost a blessing, because as much as I suffer I still won’t get that low because I just can’t feel that sad. So all I can do is suffer.

I have nothing left. I’ve become a husk, a shell, empty inside, without feeling or sadness or joy or awareness. I’ll never have a wife, I’ll never be a dad, I’ll never be successful, fulfilled, or happy. I’m nothing and I have nothing and I want to die.",m0yqt3,21,0.97,15,2021-03-09 04:29:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/m0yqt3/everything_has_been_taken_from_me/,False,False,2021,3

32,My 38 day experience with microdosing Dinitrophenol/DNP (settled at a dose of 1.6mg/day),"Firstly, before the mods or another Redditor proclaims, ""DNP is a toxic substance! It has a long history of killing people due to overheating!"" and removes this post, please consider: the dose makes the poison; this microdosing approach is hundreds of times less than the toxic dose in humans. This works on hormesis. Please read the report [here](https://controlc.com/05b3d19c)

TL;DR: microdosing a mitochondrial uncoupler called Dinitrophenol (DNP) has completely erased my depression, anhedonia, anxiety, crippling fatigue that I believe was associated either due to drug abuse and/or brainfog—the source of which still remains a mystery to me, but my money is on neuroinflammation.

>...""low dose DNP stimulates adaptive cellular stress response signaling pathways, giving you an increase in BDNF, CREB, and autophagy... [This] low dose of DNP triggers powerful adaptations that increase cellular resilience. That includes the creation of new mitochondria and the consumption of ineffective and damaged ones, neuroprotection, a reduction in reactive oxygen species, an increase in synaptic plasticity, and a lot of other benefits outlined in the study. It is hormesis in action... I was intrigued pretty quickly because: It was something that you could actually obtain, not an exotic synthesis that would take months; It worked through hormesis, something nothing has really taken advantage of yet.""

After being disappointed, time after time, through years of trying countless nootropics and cognitive enhancers (from herbal supplements, *racetams to Dihexa, NSI-189, IDRA-21, ISRIB and *many* other compounds I struggle to recall), I found little beyond the realms of small, temporary benefits which I found were bandaid-approaches as opposed to solving the underlying issues surround my incessant and crippling brain fog. Serendipitously, I stumbled upon an experience report by a man called Bill.

The details about how Bill came to find this miraculous discovery was through his ingenius pioneering into microdosing DNP can be found in his story available [here](https://controlc.com/05b3d19c) — I implore you to read this *first* to gain context into the experience report I am about to discuss.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Anyway, onto my experience reports along with the sustainable benefits I've found: even after the DNP has existed my body (around the 36 hour mark), I can still feel its benefits two days after abstinence (haven't pushed it further than this because I'm too excited that there may be further cognitive hurdles to overcome).

According to my logs—the crippling brainfog (my abysmal level of cognition), anhedonia, depression, anxiety and cognitive issues were been obliterated upon day five at 2mg/day... But around day 10, I began noticing additional fatigue (which was minor, relative to my pre-DNP state but as I was consistently experiencing new cognitive baselines, I took such states to heart).

After days of experimentation, I finally found my 'sweet spot' at 1.6mg/day (once in the morning)—any higher—even 0.1mg (to 1.7mg) and I will experience brain fog coupled with mental fatigue, potential insomnia and irritability. Taken before bedtime, I get crazy insomnia, but I've read several reports of people whom have no trouble falling asleep afterwards. Lucky sods.

Like Bill stated in his report that I linked above, I too found myself very much standing miles beyond where I was before my DNP microdosing trial, even after only 3 weeks in. After hitting the 30—35 day mark of the DNP trial, though, I'm not really noticing any additional benefits and believe I have reached my peak, although I am certainly not finding diminishing returns following each dosage.

Microdosing DNP has been—if nothing else—has been absolutely, hands-down, doubtlessly the greatest [non]-""antidepressant"" I've ever tried... And I have given countless SSRIs, many tricyclics, MAOIs, SNRIs, etc, and even after months of daily usage, the side effects turned me right off them... Even after undergoing TMS (for treatment-resistant depression), I found zero overall benefit from all of these aforementioned approaches. DNP, for me, has truly given a second chance at life with literally zero side effects (unless I take my dose near bedtime, which results in insomnia, but this is not the case for everyone).

People on a Discord group I frequent have also found benefit with their Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS).

I would *highly* recommend trialling DNP to anyone who has been struggling with the issues I've described above... Not to mention that three grams (which costs roughly 15-20USD including shipping) will last—at my current dosage of 1.6mg/day—over five years. This stuff is *insanely* inexpensive and is certainly worth a trial.",mfd09f,19,0.96,11,2021-03-28 23:45:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/mfd09f/my_38_day_experience_with_microdosing/,False,False,2021,3
33,"Brain fog, mold, mycotoxins and VCS test","Brain fog, anxiety, depression, dizziness, tinnitus, tingling sensations, mood disorders and other neurological disorders are symptoms of mycotoxins.  Mycotoxins are metabolites released by molds, most often associated with water damaged buildings, but also from contaminated foods.  Most people are able to detoxify from mycotoxins without any issues, but 25% of the population have genes that prevent their immune system from identifying and eliminating the toxins. 

I believe that the first step for anyone struggling with brain fog should be a mold / mycotoxin screening.  Great Plains has a comprehensive urine test that screens for common mycotoxins, but is it expensive at around $400.  

However, a visual contrast sensitivity test (VCS), is a 5 minute eye test that can provide an initial evaluation of whether there are any toxins affecting someones neurological health.  Tests can be performed online for a few dollars at [https://www.vcstest.com/](https://www.vcstest.com/) or [https://www.survivingmold.com/diagnosis/visual-contrast-sensitivity-vcs](https://www.survivingmold.com/diagnosis/visual-contrast-sensitivity-vcs) . Both websites have more information on mold toxicity and the VCS test.

Hope this information helps members of this subreddit who are struggling to identify the source of their brain fog.  I highly recomment taking 5 minutes and a few dollars to do the test, and either identify mold as a potential source of brain fog, or eliminating it as a source.",m99oga,19,0.92,4,2021-03-20 15:49:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/m99oga/brain_fog_mold_mycotoxins_and_vcs_test/,False,False,2021,3

1,How I Cleared the Fog,"After struggling immensely with brain fog for several years, I have made enormous steps towards mental clarity in recent months, and I wanted to share some of the lifestyle changes I've made that I believe have contributed most significantly to my progress:

**Quitting Caffeine:** This one is definitely tough, but I wholeheartedly believe that it's worth it. After spending far too much money at Dunkin Donuts as a broke college student, I decided to try quitting coffee for a while to see if I could handle life without it. The first week without coffee was incredibly challenging (I felt AWFUL), but once I began to move past the withdrawal symptoms, I started waking up in the morning with a clearer head and more energy and falling asleep much more easily at night. For some people, I understand that it may be quite difficult to transition away from caffeine completely, and if this is the case for you, I'd highly recommend first transitioning from coffee to black tea and then to green tea before quitting entirely. 

**Quitting Sugary Drinks:** This is another tough adjustment, but it made an enormous difference for me. My brain fog always seemed to get worse around meal time, and I always attributed that to my digestive system needing more energy around meal times to break down food. However, after doing some reading on the effects of sugary drinks on the brain and realizing that I drank a sweetened beverage with almost every meal (sweetened coffee or tea, Gatorade, etc.), I decided to only drink water with meals for a week and see how my body would react. Lo and behold, my brain fog around meal times began to fade away, and so did some of the fog that I experienced during other parts of the day.

**Increasing Social Interaction:** I don't know if this was just me, but I always dreaded social interaction because my brain fog sometimes made it difficult for me to speak fluently. This, I think, created a very destructive positive feedback loop; I'd have a negative social interaction because of brain fog, so I'd expose myself to social interactions less, so I'd experience an increase in brain fog that would make negative social interactions more likely, and so on and so forth. This year, I decided that I didn't want to worry about what people thought of me anymore and joined lots of different clubs at my school, which has allowed me to make some great friends. Honestly, and I really did not think this was going to be the case, making meaningful social connections this year (for the first time in several years) was probably the step I took that reduced my brain fog the most.

**Being Mindful of Muscle Tension:** This definitely won't apply to everyone, but as a former contact-sport athlete who lifts weights and exercises pretty much on a daily basis, my neck and back muscles can get REALLY tight. I was entirely unaware of this until about a month ago, when a trainer was questioning how I could be so tight without being in excruciating pain all day. After doing some reading and realizing that muscle tension in the neck and back can reduce blood flow to the brain, I decided to start rolling out, stretching, and getting some blood into my back and neck muscles every day, and this has decreased my brain fog significantly.

**Taking Control of my Responsibilities:** Some of my brain fog definitely stemmed from stress and the feeling that I didn't have control over my life. I saw a huge improvement in mental clarity when I really put my mind to being proactive and making sure that my life was in order on a daily basis.

**Going to Bed Early:** This should go without saying. If you go to bed at 3 o'clock in the morning (as I did for a long time), you're not going to have a clear head! I told myself that I had incurable insomnia (I really struggled with sleep) and that being fatigued all the time would just be a part of life for me, but once I quit caffeine and got my responsibilities in order, I started falling asleep earlier and earlier. I'm not exactly a normal sleeper now, but things are SO much better. A word of advice: if possible, stay away from prescription sleep medications. I got a prescription for a well-known one thinking it would help me sleep (and it sort of did in the short term), but the cognitive side-effects, one of which was brain fog for me, were severe enough that they outweighed the benefits. I currently take 3 mg of melatonin on weeknights (down from 10, trying to get to 0) and none on weekends (to give my body a break), and I make sure that I'm done with work and in bed by 11 every night. I'd highly recommend giving this a shot for a week!

**The Mediterranean Diet:** This winter, I read a book called *Keep Sharp* by Dr. Sanjay Gupta, in which he advocates for a Mediterranean-like diet for brain health. Feeling sort of hopeless about my brain fog, I decided to give the Mediterranean diet a shot, and it is unbelievable how different I felt after a couple days of good eating. My brain was clear and functioning at full capacity at what felt like all times, and I had a TON of energy. I don't strictly adhere to the diet anymore, but I think learning about it and experiencing a noticeable difference in quality of life after changing my diet has made me a significantly healthier eater. This has allowed me to manage my brain fog. 

There are certainly more lifestyle changes that I've made that have improved my brain fog (starting to meditate daily, challenging myself mentally and physically as often as possible, among others), but realizing how long this post is already, I'm going to cut it here. I've never posted here before and apologize if I'm breaking any guidelines, but with how much I've struggled with brain fog and how much I know some of you are struggling, I really wanted to share my experiences. Good luck everyone - brain fog can seem inevitable, but there's a way out! 

Please feel free to message me if you have any questions, and do note that I'm not any sort of medical professional (so take everything I say with a grain of salt).

2,"When the brain fog goes away it almost feels like I just used nasal spray for a congested nose, but for my whole head instead","When the brainfog is really bad and then suddenly starts going away by like 90% it feels kind of like a fresh breeze of air just passed through my head, clearing out all the gunk, making my head and forehead pressure go away, making my vision clear and focused again and allowing me to have a sharp mind again. Feels like a splash of cold water in the face after a hike out in the middle of summer.

4,"After 9 months of hell, I’m almost positive I found the root cause....UARS.","I have obstruction through my nose that I can never breath through. 

My sleep study showed I had 62 RDI’s (arousal’s). My oxygen dropped to 85% because I was suffocating, and because of that my heart rate jacked up from my resting heart rate (which is 35 bc I am a runner, and it jacked up to 87.) 

I have not been getting adequate restful sleep for 2 years. No wonder why I feel like shit ALL the time. 

No doctor was smart enough to tell me, “uhhhh how’s you’re sleep?” 

All they ever told me is that I’m depressed and have anxiety and that I need to see a physiologist. Wanted to make me a walking pharmaceutical company and throw drugs.

I would HIGHLY recommend taking a wholistic approach, where they look at everything.

Hormones, Genetics, Toxins, Allergies, Food Allergies, Diet, Overall lifestyle, and in my case.... Sleep. 

Looking back I really was not feeling good for about 2 years, becoming more fatigued. However the fog seriously got bad about 8 months ago. 

Take the wholesistic approach, because guess what... if you’re not feeling good, uuuhhh duh you are going to be showing symptoms that make you feel depressed and have anxiety. For me it was the fear of the unknown.  

One might have depression and that might be the underlying cause for the fog. However for me I KNEW it was something else and I refused to take a pill. 


God bless and I really hope all of you find the cause and move FORWARD in life. Much love. I will keep y’all updated on my progress!",mrh1hn,55,0.97,12,2021-04-15 15:28:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/mrh1hn/after_9_months_of_hell_im_almost_positive_i_found/,False,False,2021,4
5,Brain fog makes me feel profoundly vulnerable,"I feel like in just being robbed of the ability to intuitively understand, remember, or function properly in the way that I had, it’s almost like feeling like a child. It’s deeply frustrating when you can’t even be sure what did or didn’t happen, or have accepted you can’t remember what someone’s telling you so you just nod along knowing their directions will be lost by the time you start whatever you were trying to do.

I genuinely feel like lost child, and because of the way my perception/emotion is blunted, even more so. It’s like, I’m someone who got tossed down to a two dimensional plane, and is looking up from it trying to function like someone whose still living in three dimensions. It’s really changed my personality. I’m in a neutral/ok mood most days but, really just at the expense of everything else. It’s like, sure, the anxiety I had prior to all of this was extremely rough, but at least I could perceive the world and truly experience it. The cost of losing it was all of the things that really made me feel, like *me*.",mx1w14,53,0.99,11,2021-04-23 18:32:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/mx1w14/brain_fog_makes_me_feel_profoundly_vulnerable/,False,False,2021,4
6,Brain fog gone after 2 years straight - Zoloft,"Hey guys, I felt it was finally time to post this because I wanted to be sure it was gone first before giving high hopes. It’s now been 2 months that I have been almost completely brain fog free. It took 3 months on Zoloft figuring out my right dose, 100mg for 6 weeks straight finally did it. I feel the most calm and clear minded I have felt in years. My horrible memory is back, im sharp, and I enjoy life. 

It all started to go downhill with brain fog 2 years ago after i contracted a parasite traveling in Brazil. I took 2 different strong antibiotics short times apart to get rid of it and it completely destroyed my gut. For 2 years I was trying to find a natural cure, I was really against antidepressants and thought I could figure out the root cause. I tried all kinds of diets (low fodmap, AIP, Paleo, etc.) celery juicing, i saw 4 different holistic doctors and probably spent around $5-$6,000 on supplements and visits. I started dating a girl (surprisingly) around February and she told me she was on Zoloft too, has been for 8 years and it saved her life, she’s 26 i’m 30. So it gave me more confidence to take it too, also a reddit user had told me Zoloft helped him with his brainfog too so I had even more hope from it. It was up’s and downs like crazy the first 2 month, then i would have less and less frequent bouts of fog, and now it is rare that I do, and if i do its only for a day or two. 

The point is I tried a lot of things because I never related depression to brain fog, but brain fog IS a side effect of depression, and antidepressants do help with it! It was just a serotonin imbalance for me I believe, since a lot of your serotonin is produced from the gut and mine was compromised for a while. You may have to get on different brands and figure out your dosage, but just trust in it, and stick through the side effects and ups and downs and I swear to you it will be worth it. I can finally breath again, I was trapped for so long, couldn’t concentrate on simple tasks, horrible memory, always tired, just a mental block, its the worst thing ever, i thought i’d never get out. I am so glad I went this route. If anyone wants to talk privately about it feel free to dm. Please don’t give up, there is an answer to your brain fog. You’re not crazy.

7,My Theory on Brain Fog,"It’s the aftermath effect of bad stress & anxiety.  

I am posting with the purpose of trying to help as I first got hit with it in 2017 (don’t worry it only lasted 3-4 months in its longest stints).  I have had my bouts with the fog multiple times as it has been my cross to bear.  

After dealing with it and getting to the other side...oh my...the clear head, confidence, full capable brain that can conceptualize topics/questions anything thrown my way and respond in full confidence... I can’t say how amazing it feels to beat it.

I’m not a doctor but my friends and family have heard me talk about the fog long enough that I would consider myself experience.  It sucks, it’s debilitating at one stint I lost 30 pounds.  

My theory:
ANXIETY & STRESS.  I scroll through a lot of the posts on here and I feel for everyone and one common thing I see is everyone is looking for an answer everywhere (paranoid).  That is the anxious mind.  Our body’s feel threatened and thus sometimes we spiral to believe it can be associated to anything because we just want it to end.

In my experience the fog would onset after unmanaged stress & anxiety and it was my minds coping response to the stress... making me fuzzy.

What I did:
-quit alcohol & weed.

-SSRI (consult a doctor) - I was an anxious stressed wreck during the brain fog days while have to work a pretty tough job.  We then hypothesized the fog was due to anxiety despite it being a response also to being foggy so I started on an SSRI.

-vitamin B complex 

-healthy diet (vegetables, meat for protein and stayed away from processed, sugary and heavy carb diets)

-routines: I love to chat with friends on the phone, occupy my mind. “Idle mind is the devils playground.” Get back those muscles that made me who I am, a social person.  I also pushed myself to keep doing my hobbies and ultimately gardening became something so peaceful it created a place for me to enjoy the work I invested.

-breathing/meditation.  When our minds are in fight or flight and blood is flowing to the wrong areas as a response to “fight” - breathing is the one way we can regain control of our system.  

-positive self talk, trick your mind into focusing on more positive thoughts and lie to yourself everyday that you are fine and feel great.  It will pass. It works, be patient. 

This is my story but I can’t help but want to share as I scroll through this sub and see all these ideas being thrown and it can feel overwhelming or downright crazy.  If you haven’t thought of treating your anxiety, it may be the root cause you never expected.

TL,DR: brain fog is the body’s response to immense stress and bad anxiety.",mzgopl,50,0.95,22,2021-04-27 04:44:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/mzgopl/my_theory_on_brain_fog/,False,False,2021,4

11,Finally I understood my brain fog after 6 years,"Everything started when I turned 30 and moved to Finland. And it took 6 years to understand what actually causes brain fog. Thanks for modern medicine. I spent thousands of Euros, but all in vain. Most doctors know nothing. I figured it out with daily food experiments. Here is the 4 pillars of my brain fog:

1) Egg yolks, fat in dairy, fat in meat: Warming these foods makes significant effect on the level of brain fog. I can drink a glass of whole fat milk without any issues. But if I warm it up to add into coffee, it has to be skimmed milk. Even 1% fat milk causes brain fog. Melting cheese is a big trigger.

Egg yolks: Sometimes I can eat boiled eggs without problem. Temperature is the thing. In boiling it doesn't exceed 100 degree celcius. If I fry them and make an omelette with whole eggs, it gives terrible brain fog. First I was thinking the cooking oil was causing it. One day I decided to get rid of yolks, omelette didn't give brain fog anymore.

Fat in meat: Lean meat is one of the safest choices. But if I fry, bake or boil meat which has high fat content, it gives brain fog. On the flipside, if I fry chicken especially wings, it is ok. But if I bake it in the oven for 45 minutes at 240 degree celcius, it causes brain fog. I clearly see that high temperature makes it more greasy. I've read that high temperature cooking turns fat into trans fat.

No need to mention that all unhealthy fat in fast food, packed foods, processed meat, nuts, etc causes huge brain fog.

2) Wheat: Eating pasta, white bread, any food cooked with flour, drinking beer gives brain fog. Later I realized that corn flour and Corona beer cause no issues. I think Corona beer contains very low gluten.  Alternatively to wheat, I eat 100% oat bread, oat porridge and rye bread without any problem.

3) Sugar: Sugar is a big trigger, but not all kinds of sugar. Several times I drank glucose before blood sugar tests in the hospital, it created zero problem. But just one bite of a banana or apple can give me huge brain fog. There are certain types of fruits which are safe. These include kiwi, strawberries and avocadoes. I think the ratio of glucose/fructose/sucrose makes the difference. On the flipside, I can eat boiled sweet potatoes. But baking them cause the starch to turn into candies. Cooking temperature makes big difference.

4) Amount of calories: Even if I eat the safest choice like %100 oat porridge, eating more than my normal gives me brain fog.

Finally, I can feel normal with a very strict diet. I can think normal. I have no idea why this happened to me.

I believe it is associated with some autoimmune disease, insulin resistance and blood triglycerides/cholesterol levels. In the second year, I was diagnosed with insulin resistance.  I started to eat low carb, exercising regularly, but it didn't change the fact that I get huge brain fog after ""healthy"" meals.

I am 75 kg, 1.77 tall and relatively healthy guy.  I had quit smoking when all this started, have no alcohol or drug issues and always tried to have a healthy diet. Of course there were times I drank more than usual in parties or ate burgers with friends. But it never became a habit.

My father has type 2 diabetes, has always high triglycerides levels. I believe I have a genetic predisposition for diabetes and  high triglycerides . In my blood tests triglycerides/cholesterol levels were relatively higher than optimal levels, but there was no need for any kind of medicine.

After the first year of insulin resistance/brain fog, I also developed allergic asthma. One day I realized I had no brain fog using anti-histamines. But later I developed tolerance and they started not working. Then I increased the dose, but this gave a huge tiredness to me and was still not much effective. I stopped using them.

13,Can internet/device addiction cause brain fog? Hear me out.,"Internet addiction is definitely a thing. But how bad is it really? My speculation is that it actually alters the way we process information.  These devices have a million apps on them all competing for our attention, and so often we either succumb to doing 20 things at once on our devices or have to exert an incredible amount of willpower constantly to remain focused on whatever primary thing we’re doing. The latter can be quite unsustainable, so even then we cave after a while. I suppose this pattern of drifting into other seductive apps that spike our dopamine and then trying to pull back into our primary task may be rewiring our brains to have this super non-linear way of processing and executing things.

This is compounded by the fact that there’s so often a phone or computer or tablet nearby almost 24/7, and you do your day work on it and listen to music and chat with friends etc etc. EVERYTHING on there. 

I’ve enabled time tracking on my tablet and phone and I’m extremely embarrassed about how much time I spend on there. And when I’m not on my devices for some miraculous reason, I feel this “signal interrupt” in my brain that goes “I wonder what’s on Reddit/Instagram/etc etc”anytime I try to have a sustained thought.  Oh yeah, one more thing.. maybe that vague soreness behind the eyes is actually eye strain from staring at screens all day?

This is definitely a suspect in my lineup because frankly I can’t think of a single week in the past 10 years where I didn’t have reasonable access to the internet.  I wonder how my brain would change if I took a few weeks off and moved to a log cabin? Maybe it won’t cure everything, but maybe it contributes a lot? Has anyone tried an internet fast or anything like that? I’d love to hear some personal anecdotes about this.",mtv6cb,38,0.97,20,2021-04-19 07:07:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/mtv6cb/can_internetdevice_addiction_cause_brain_fog_hear/,False,False,2021,4
14,Can't seem to ever remember the information I need to make a point,"For context, I have brain fog from depression/anxiety/autoimmune disease.

It's become painfully obvious to me that I usually can't explain concepts to people or have complicated discussions on different topics. If I'm in an argument, I will know the point I want to make but I can never remember the things I've learned to make it make sense. I usually end up going ""Well you see... ah... um... I'm having trouble explaining it."" I always regret it the moment I say something.

It's become a great source of frustration for me. Because you can't explain yourself, it usually seems like the point is invalid because you can't ""prove it"" or people assume you don't know anything about what you're trying to talk about. Which is partially true... but I just don't remember a lot of what I learn, even if I want to. I can't recall it on the spot either. Unless I'm constantly thinking about it, I lose the information. It makes me think this must be common with people who have brain fog, esp in combination with anxiety. If you keep having trouble with this over and over, it becomes scarier and scarier to speak up.

I try to be positive about it but it's hard when you're around people that don't know and it feels like you're trying their patience or making things awkward.

15,Never lose hope fellow redditors,"I had it for more than 10 years, i ruined my uni and i lost myself. I felt not understood by the society. I couldn’t even describe what i was feeling. I went to several doctors, they all said the same. I accepted my fate, i hated it but i didn’t know what it was. I named it pre dementia. I scrolled over and over in this group, i read succes stories, and that give me the courage to start searching again for a solution. I want to thank them and i hope i can canalize it for those who need it.

I tried another treatment with more scientific approach and guess what i’ve cured myself.

I feel alive and happy. I can speak again, i can say what i want to say. I can make plan on the long run. I feel alive... i feel i am back. 

I am doing sports everyday, before i felt always tired. I gained weight... now i am losing weight about 10 lbs for the moment.
I am fasting, i eat one meal a day. I am on 6 weeks already. 
I stoped smoking because i could ‘look better’ in to the consequences (part of how to cope with discipline)
My talking skills went with roughly 40% up, before i stopped sometimes in the middle of a sentence to try recall that one word. It was annoying for those who were listening. It gives you an unpleasant feeling. You feel ‘dissocialized’ and you start to doubt...  
I learnt to save a lot of money, i am going on a worldtrip. 
I learnt to trade
I am going to study again, i ll combine it with work.

It’s just as if the intuitive concept is gone now.

It’s kind of like I’m more earnest, like, excessively so. As a result, I can’t really deliver jokes, or be able to use irony. It’s just lost on me now.

23,Hydration is so underrated !,"Long story short, I have been battling brain fog for the better part of my life, you know how that goes you visit a bunch of practitioners and go as far as trying unconventional methods like chiropractics, naturopathy and yada yada yada.  

Nothing seems to work permanently, I have been deceited many times before by placebos and suffered immensely from my relapses until I've decided recently to try something out, something really simple that has benefited me like no other.  

All it took me was drinking water consistently, as many ounces as I can. I had several stints to the bathroom granted, but honest to God the minute I started my day with a big glass of water things have only turned out for the best, I could see the changes in mood, speech and behaviour effected immediately.

More often than not I would neglect myself and wallow in misery and despair, as a result I would only be drinking one glass or two per day which is way below the recommended daily intake.

Needless to say, consistency is key. Once I implemented this habit, I started seeing benefits galore, and by the time my body adjusted perfectly to my newly added routine, my brain started emerging from its previous state.

Fair warning, I have only been familiar with hydration and its benefits (I know how that sounds) for two weeks, but what urged me to post prematurely was how unexpectedly my fog lifted by way of something so easy and simple.

28,Reposting this cause I desperately need help right now....,"I been dealing with brain fog since I was 16, never had a history of drug abuse, virus infection, or alcohol problem. while it wasn’t exactly too noticeable at the time I knew for a fact it stemmed around this time as I could recall things becoming rather a bit blunter then normal before it took a dangerous turn. The year past and I became 17 my brain fog began to plunge into something I haven’t excepted I realized the my executive functions began to slow down and my creativity and my ability to make mental images seemed to have degraded almost completely , to add to this it was 24/7 and no matter what I did it wouldn’t get better. While I thought it couldn’t get any worst it continued to do, skip now to me being 18 and my brain fog is incredibly unbearable. I can’t draw, play puzzle games, read books, or watch tv, leaving the house feels scary as I can’t process at all what’s going on around me nor can I follow any of my families discussions. The video games I use to play are followed by an extreme form of anhedonia as I can not feel pleasure in leveling up or getting cool and interesting items, as if I’m stuck, nor am I motivated to play them anymore. I can’t even get up in the morning anymore and my parents shame me everyday for it, it makes me wanna cry but I CANT give in to this fogs torture. I swear this has to be some kinda neurodegenerative disease, it’s to much. The strange thing though is that my CT scan that came a few months ago showed that everything was in amazing condition, as stated by my doctor. 

*At this point I can’t get out of bed, and if this persists and worsens for another month, I’ll most likely be brain dead*


Health/ general  record:

30,I think I MAY be on to something.,"So long story short, I've been a sufferer of brain fog for years. But because of unrelated symptoms, I've had to take an MRI and an MRA of my brain. This is because for almost a year now I've been having countless episodes of dizziness and vertigo and unexplained, chronic pain around the neck/shoulder blades. What they found was interesting, to say the least.

Apparently, one of my carotid arteries is smaller than the other. I've since been seeing a neurologist and have met with her since two of these have been done, and she seems to think that there could be a calcium deposit, meaning that a buildup of calcium that could be clogging one of my arteries. What do the carotid arteries do, you ask? **They supply oxygen to the brain**. A lack of said oxygen could lead to brain fog and the other symptoms I'm experiencing. I'm of course going to be doing further test, including a CT scan and an EMG. However, I'm considering an MRI of my neck to check the carotid arteries there as well.

4,Turns out nightshade allergy was the root cause of my brain fog.,"Been suffering from brain fog for nearly a decade now and went through dozens of doctors and tried hundreds of things and just couldn't figure it out. All my blood tests were normal, did a sleep test, went to a neurologist, endocrine, EKG, etc and everything came back normal. I've cut gluten, wheat, soy, dairy, etc and I just couldn't eat anything except veggies and fruits but even then I still had severe brain fog and I was very frustrated. Fast forward to two weeks ago, i didnt eat all day till I came home from work. So I ate the fried potatoes and ketchup and felt very woozy after a few minutes. Then i asked myself if it was possible to be allergic to ketchup and potato. So i researched this and found out about nightshade allergy which included fruits and other foods such as tomato, potatoes, peppers, etc. and all of a sudden it just clicked in my head. I didnt realize condiments were a potential allergen to me because I was focused on the primary allergens such as gluten and dairy. Also explains why I felt so tired after eating pasta or garnish that had tomatoes in it.

So I cut out any nightshade foods from my diet and a few days later I felt more clear minded. Of course i wanted to wait a few weeks to make sure that it was actually the root cause. I introduced gluten, soy, and dairy back into my diet and am still somewhat clear headed. Though I had some Tabasco sauce earlier so I'm a bit woozy now. I also suffer from derealization too. I'm hoping I'll feel more healed as time goes on, but in the mean time I suggest you guys look into nightshade allergy and try removing those foods from your diet.",n5xynv,46,0.98,6,2021-05-06 03:18:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/n5xynv/turns_out_nightshade_allergy_was_the_root_cause/,False,False,2021,5
5,BEWARE OF ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS!!!!!! STORY," 

so ive been dealing with some serious problems the last few months. Neurological problems like anxiety, depression, brain fog and other problems like hot flashes, feeling dizzy/lightheaded, having a really hard time formulating sentences, feeling fatigued and weak and pain out of nowhere in my knees and elbows.

i started noting down 6 months ago how i felt on particular days and what i was eating. first, i found a connection between intake of oats / wheat and gluten products, and quickly removed thoose. symptoms got better in around 3 days. but still have had lingering issues that has been ruining my life for the last year. and i couldnt find out why..

So i dig some deeper. and i remembered i had bookmarked a page regarding aspartame poisoning, and its link to alzherimer and neurological issues. I had stopped drinking ""diet drinks"" and stuff that didnt contain it. however.... ive been having electrolyte powders, pre workout powders (no caffeine), and reduced sugar ketchup.

i read the label on them... and they all have SUCRALOSE.

but i thought to myself, surely such a low amount of a artificial sweetner cant cause this big of a problem right? i mean, im having a big list of stuff that just have been getting worse and worse over the years.

i have been using theese powders for around 4 years or so now. almost everyday.

and guess what.........

after 4 days of going strictly without consuming ANY SUCRALOSE. i suddently woke up on day 5, feeling absolutely amazing. like my brain turned a switch. holy crap. i cant beleve i finally feel good. i thought i was never going to get back to how i used to feel like in my teens. im 25 now and have been gradually got worse ever since. especially my anxiety. i used to be so confident. and i became a shy introverted little man that escaped to his room because he couldnt even hold a conversation with his mom. how degrading and how depressing?

anyways. i am feeling so good now, i just had to share this with anyone. PLEASE LOOK AT UR DIET AND GET THIS POISON OUT OF UR BODY.

google it and read up on the horrible effects it has on the body.

sure.. u can drink a diet pepsi here n there, or have some powders. thats what i thought earlier!!! but a small poison everyday, may become a big issue over time.......

same goes for eating gluten products.. ""uuuuh if youre not celiac you dont need to worry about eating gluten"" tell me that in 10 years after consuming gluten every day. you wont cuz you will be in a huge regret not listening to my advice.

anyways hope u guys can learn from my mistake and do not waste ur life living in misery because of this. Eat whole foods, throw the powders out. get ur macro and micronutrient profile in check. and live a happy life.",n3w6rv,43,0.96,17,2021-05-03 13:34:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/n3w6rv/beware_of_artificial_sweetners_story/,False,False,2021,5

This is super disheartening as I am scared to take any type of medication for my anxiety or depression, and I feel there are many other avenues out there to explore. The compounding variable is that the brain fog I feel makes it super difficult to plan or rationalize with myself when I am feeling very anxious or depressed. When I had more clarity of mind I felt more in control, more emotive, more responsive. Now feel a lot of nothingness. I want to be normal again so bad. And the fact that I want it hopefully means I am not 100% dead inside, but I’m just a fucking vegetable at this point watching the days go by while I work my job and see some friends on the weekends.

This situation screwed my life for 6 years. It started when I moved from Turkey to Finland. Initial test had shown that I had low vitamin D levels. Thanks for living SO close to North Pole. Then I started to take Vitamin D supplements regularly. Then blood levels went back to normal. I kept taking them regularly for years. 

Recently, I wanted to give a try to increase vitamin D dose from 20 micrograms to 100 micrograms daily. In a few weeks, my brain fog improved so much. I eat all the triggering foods ´and don't have any brain fog anymore. Didn't eat all of them yet, but condition is improved very clearly.  Also normally I am supposed to have allergic asthma symptoms in this time of the year. It is all gone.

Even if your vitamin D levels are normal according to blood tests, increasing the dose might be helpful for brain fog and other immune system problems.

12,To the people who cured brain fog,"Hi guys! I just have a bunch of questions, any feedback is appreciated:)

1) What was the reason behind your brain fog? 

2) How long did your brain fog last?

3) How did you cure your brain fog?

4) How old are you? What is your sex? (You don’t have to answer this if you don’t feel comfortable) 

4) When you got/cured your brain fog was it instant? Or was it gradual?

5) Did all the past information you once felt like you’ve lost forever suddenly return or was it a working effort to get back to your once normal/familiar state of mind?

It really sucks to be going through this, but we’re all in this together:) and I think this might shed some light to anyone thats losing hope. Thanks!",ncru30,29,0.98,35,2021-05-15 05:47:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/ncru30/to_the_people_who_cured_brain_fog/,False,False,2021,5

14,Brain fog improved at night - please help,"I have been having extremely bad brain fog that is impacting my uni work and prohibiting me from socialising. When I wake I feel tired a little foggy but not terrible then as I reach the afternoon I feel very foggy and dissociated. I get very bloated and tired , sometimes I have a nap which makes me feel better. It’s very hard to hold conversations with people as their words aren’t processing and I can’t formulate a response properly. I have cut out wheat, dairy, soy, gluten, legumes and have seen only little improvement. I also have very bad anxiety and depression now from not being able to socialise. Odly however at around 10pm my symptoms significantly subside and I feel very happy positive and more alert. This cycle repeats. I have been diagnosed with ADD however I believe this ‘fog’ to be separate from this as stimulants can make my brain fog worse. I have a feeling it’s related to my food as I have stomach problems already however I find it odd that I am not nearly as effected at night (though sometimes I am) I would really appreciate any insight.",n6znww,28,1.0,24,2021-05-07 14:22:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/n6znww/brain_fog_improved_at_night_please_help/,False,False,2021,5
15,Fixed my brain fog,"I was having horrible brain fog and wanted to share my experience to hopefully help one of you. I was having brain fog every single day after every meal which made me develop a horrible “relationship” with food to the point I wouldn’t eat all day just to not have this fog. What I found out is that it was a potassium deficiency. I would heavily heavily salt all of my meals but realized I was getting little to no potassium through my diet but I was getting high levels of all the other electrolytes. I found this out by every time I ate a spinach salad I wouldn’t have any brain fog after. Then I started tracking my meals through chronometer and started to find the pattern. I slowly started adding in potassium salt mix and it has been life changing for me. Everyone around me thinks I’m a new person. I wanted to share this to give hope that you will find what is causing you these issues and to not accept a lower quality of life.

16,BRAIN FOG - HOW I REDUCED IT WITHIN 2 WEEKS,"Right, Im a 24yold maleSo Im a heavy weed smoker of 4 years and did a really heavy weekend on the drink and smoke.

This triggered my severe brain fog. The next 2 weeks were hell with brain fog and I essentially lived in a dream world/ state. Had no clue wtf was going on. Thought I had ruined my life from 1 night of partying.

Over the next week had Loads of pressure on my head and really worried about my health.Constantly thought about it.

At this point I thought I was fucked for life and kinda accepted the fact I was brain dead... (Even planned to commit suicide if I was not better in 1 years time)My suicide plan was (Your going to laugh but I was dead set on this)  I was going to hire a Ferrari 488 and write it off at 200mph into a brick wall... (Im laughing while writing this now)

2 weeks later im nearly back to my normal self and here writing this postHere is what I did and sure it will help others.

The first thing I did was accept that I had brain fog and that the effects are not permanent.(This is really important)Also dont stress about the brain fog because it makes it 10x worse. You will put yourself in a bad cycle.Also cut out Alcohol and Weed completely. Anything that is TOXIC to your body.

This was my morning routine for the next week -

**Mornings -**\- Took multi Vitamin tablets and Glyco sports tablets. with 1/2 litre water.- 300MG Ginkgo Biloba (This really helps!)- 3000Ug B12 Vitamin Tablets- 100mg CBD oil- 3000mg cod liver oil tablets- 3 litres of water a day- 30 minutes exercise, followed by a hot bath with muscle relaxing bathing soap.- Put on my favorite song on and sang it out loud at the top of my voice everyday.

**Evenings -**\- Healthy dinner (Lots of fruit and veg and FISH!)- 30 minutes exercise (Weight lifting)- Hot bath with relaxing salts- 15 minutes meditation (Really focus on your breathing)- 100mg CBD oil- 5Htp before bed.- Also gaming at night helped me not focus on my brain fog.- 9-10 hours of rest a night ( Goto bed before midnight)

I saw improvements within a week and really am nearly cured of this brain fog.I had truly lost hope before I applied this diet.

I JUST ASK ANYONE THAT HAS BRAIN FOG TRY TRIAL MY ROUTINE AND LET ME KNOW OF ANY IMPROVEMENTS.

I hope this helps other people. This is just what has helped me massively.God bless",nh5s0o,24,0.85,19,2021-05-20 17:10:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/nh5s0o/brain_fog_how_i_reduced_it_within_2_weeks/,False,False,2021,5

21,Brain Fog Q's,"Hi all, I'm Lexi. I struggled with brain fog on and off for around 5 or so years. I went to countless doctors who, when describing my symptoms, would look at me like I was a crazy person...one even told me it was all in my head and that I should see a psychiatrist lol! I remember feeling like their was a veil over me at all times, or like I was constantly hung over. I just didn't feel right. I couldn't get simple things done, everything felt hard, it was exhausting. I eventually got really interested in nutrition and started doing a lot of research on what causes brain fog, why it affects certain people and not others and what I could do to mediate it. A few years later and I've beaten my brain fog, gotten my energy back and no longer feel like I'm trapped in a never-ending hang over. I wanted to share my story as I now work with clients as a Holistic Nutritionist to help them understand, resolve, and get rid of their brain fog. If anyone in here relates to my experience I would love to chat...no strings attached. I genuinely want to help people beat this, because I know its possible and I understand the impact food/what you are eating can have on brain fog.

22,Journal entry: Trying to do math for the first time in years,"Now that I've gained enough physical vigor to be able to sit down and concentrate, its time to work on the neural ""muscles"" I've lost all these years.

It feels like there's a stuffy knot at the back of my head congesting all the traffic blood, oxygen, neurons-- whatever may be that needs to move for the brain to function. Not quite dizziness or headache, but more like lightheadedness or anemia-like feeling. I have to always be wary of tension or hotness building up in my neck, in which case I stand up to walk around and stretch a bit.

My current plan is to keep working at eliminating all potential causes that are under my control (lifestyle, diet, exercise, posture, etc), while keep receiving upper cervical treatment until I get another X-ray exam in about a month. If I don't feel significant improvement by then, I'm looking to get a brain MRI and see if more conventional medicine can help.

I have been to every specialist and gotten every scan and nothing shows anything wrong. I never had any covid symptoms and got an antibody test that was negative so I don't think it's that.

4,Comprehensive guide as to what greatly reduced my brain fog,"Just like all of you, I suffered from feeling like a robot everyday. I'd wake up and immediately feel like going back to bed because my brain fog activated as soon as my eyes reopened. Tasks that were once easy were all a big chore and it was making me irritable and anxious, maybe even a bit depressed. This went on for about a year and a half (spanning from early march of 2020 to just last month). 

Now let me start by saying that everything i'm about to list below has POSSIBLY helped me reduce my brain fog and may NOT work for everyone. We're all different and brainfog can be caused by just about any physical or mental health offset. 

Things that changed: I came home from a college environment, so my stress levels had greatly decreased. I cut down on the % of nicotine in my vape from 5% down to 3% (I actually believe that this was a major help). I'm not longer drinking alcohol every other day now that i'm out of the college environment. I started going on walks as soon as I woke up, for about 30 minutes even if I didn't feel like it at the time. I learned (and continue to learn) different ways to cope with my anxiety and panic disorder. I take cold showers (sometimes warm showers to start with a cold rinse at the end). I use the f.lux app on my computer so the blue light on my screen decreases as it gets later in the day. I've started drinking a lot more water and running on the treadmill. 

Now there may be some things i'm missing but those are the major ones and I hope that you take the time to read through them. Think about applying some of these things to your own daily routine. For me, I think my body has more trouble than other's, processing toxins (alcohol, nictotine, etc..). This would explain the sudden decrease in brainfog as soon as I cut down on those things.

Just know that you can fix this and it will take a lot of trial and error. You'll also need to allow a large time frame before knocking something off the list as not working.

5,Is anyone else's brainfog basically like dementia? I feel so alone.,"I have horrible all consuming brainfog that has just gotten worse and worse over the last 10 years and now i can't do anything anymore. How I'm still able to type this is beyond me, I'm sure I'll lose the ability to write or speak in sentences as well eventually. 

I can barely do basic everyday stuff like dress myself in the morning, cook, eat, clean etc etc. It's too confusing for my brain. I constantly forget to eat or drink. I don't remember yesterday or the days before, just random fragments of something if I'm lucky. I can't make lists or anything because i forget they exist. Forget about more ""complex"" stuff like paying the bills. 

I know it's not all gone, it still seems to be there on some level, when the fog clears up a tiny bit i can remember stuff that was inaccessible before but even on ""good days"" I'm still completely cognitively disabled beyond anything I've ever seen or read in all those years of searching for answers and other people with debilitating brainfog. 
It's like the majority of people still seem to have some baseline level of functioning like i had in the early years and some also seem to have a ""stable"" level of fog that's not progressive.

I just don't understand why mine just keeps getting worse and worse. It feels like 90% of the mitochondria in my brain are broken, not enough energy for even a single thought. 

I'm also pretty sure i roughly know the causes of my brainfog but i can't do anything to combat them right now because I'm so goddamn stupid and confused. I'm like an amoeba or sth.
I'm so so so scared.

7,How I'm making progress with my brain fog treatment,"Hello,

I wanted to update this sub as I make progress with my brain fog treatment. After 6+ years of progressively worse brain fog, it seems like I finally managed to pin mine down to a type of sleep apnea called ""Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome"". Mine is being caused due to having underdeveloped jaws (narrow palate and slightly recessed mandible). As of right now I am treating this with a machine called BiPAP (BiLevel Positive Airway Pressure) which I've been titrating to work like a ventilator and help support my breathing while I sleep. I tried a CPAP before but hated it. I had a handful of days where I felt improvement with the CPAP but most days I actually felt worse. I simply could not tolerate the exhale on the machine. Personally, I don't know why CPAPs are even prescribed in the first place when BiLevel PAP machines are like 10x more comfortable. While I don't actually have very many apneas, my sleep-disordered breathing is mostly being caused by hypopnea (periods of shallow breathing), RERAs (Respiratory Effort Related Arousals), and flow limitations (or ""tiny chokes"").

It took me a while to understand how the BiPAP works and to find the ideal settings to help pin the airway open while I sleep. But so far these are the improvements I've been noticing - insomnia is improving, easier to get up in the morning, less anxiety and intrusive thoughts, concentration and anhedonia are improving, and my writer's block is finally starting to lift (I produce music as a hobby, but had to go on hiatus when my fog got bad). 

However, I still have a lot of progress to go. Some issues I'm running into are: positional flow limitations (my airway might be open but when I toss or turn in my sleep this starts causing flow limitations. So I'm going to experiment with a soft cervical collar to prevent chin tucking and other positional flow limitations), poor nasal breathing (I'm forced to mouth breathe most nights which makes my sleep-disordered breathing worse), and lingering trauma from growing up with an undiagnosed sleep breathing disorder (more on that later). 

My next step is a type of bone-borne Adult palate expander called MSE (Maxillary Skeletal Expander) or MARPE (Miniscrew Assisted Rapid Palate Expansion). Because the mid palatal suture fuses when a person is 15-16, an adult palate expander has to be bone-borne instead of tooth-borne. So I am going in Monday (June 14th) and getting it installed under local anesthetic. Everyday the expander is activated using a key, and eventually the mid palatal suture is split which expands the maxilla in order to improve nasal breathing and increase the size of the oral cavity. Because the top of the palate is the base of the nasal cavity, by expanding the palate you are also increasing the size of the nasal cavity at the skeletal level. As well as allowing more room for the tongue in the mouth. Once I start to expand and my nasal breathing improves, I can start practicing regular mouth taping with BiPAP to help my recovery. 

Finally, I am also going to start EMDR soon. Basically, because I had to spend the formative years of my life getting a daily lobotomy in my sleep every night then getting gaslit by everybody under the sun into believing that I'm just lazy and don't care about anything, I ended up developing trauma symptoms. What really exacerbated the trauma symptoms was the fact that I was never able to get adequate REM sleep. REM sleep is the sleep stage where your mind processes stress. But because I was never able to get proper REM, the stress/burnout over the years compounded. This caused me to develop over time symptoms like flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, suicidal feelings, and worsened my dissociation/derealization. EMDR or Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing is a type of psychotherapy that uses left and right eye movements to help the brain process distressing thoughts/memories. This is what your brain does naturally during REM. But because I grew up not getting proper REM, my brain was not able to do this on its own.

9,Could we all be suffering from a mild form of Auto-immune Encephalitis???,"I seen this idea mentioned on the covid long haulers subreddit as alot of them are experiencing the exact same symptoms as us. Personally I believe this is worth looking into as I believe alot of us are suffering from a mild (understudied) form of encephalitis. I recently read some personal stories of encephalitis sufferers and it almost seems like we are all suffering from a mild form of that. And alot of things match up too. Many of you on here have either one or more of these traits in common:

1. Brainfog, dr/dp, short-term memory and mood issues started after a flu/viral illness. Also that initial almost like psychosis period at the start of dr/dp where everything looks alien and your real paranoid and go through a OCD type phase too then the mood swings etc. Those are all telltale signs of Encephalitis causing a inflammatory response in you brain. Accept others have a far more severe form of this ours seemed rather mild. 

2. You had a very stressful years prior to the onset of your brainfog and your immune may have been compromised by that stress leaving you more susceptible to illness. 

3. You were in your early to mid 20s when it first occurred which seems to be the most common age for people to have acquired more severe forms of encephalitis.

4. You already had preexisting issues with sinuses (Chronic Sinusitis) and jaw (TMJ) which would left you even more susceptible to sickness, combined with stress etc.

5. Most of us are generally quite, healthy, intelligent individuals prior who wouldn't sort of be exposed to common colds very often. There for wouldn't have had much of a resistance to a stronger bug if it were to hit us hard.

There are a couple more similaritys but those are the main ones... 

What are you guys thoughts on this idea? Alot of people with our symptoms are being misdiagnosed with bi-polar, depression, adhd, psychosis and having pill, after pill shoved down their throats which is just causing more problems when there is actually a far more complex problem going on here which needs to be addressed.",ntwv13,34,0.93,59,2021-06-06 22:02:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/ntwv13/could_we_all_be_suffering_from_a_mild_form_of/,False,False,2021,6
10,Fixed my fog with sodium!!,"Due to exercising regularly and making home cooked meals with relatively little salt I ended up sodium deficient for years. I noticed I was more fatigued after weight training than anything else. On a whim one morning I had a tsp of salt (2000mg sodium) and near instant relief and the fog was gone. I knew salt was important so I’d supplement like 500mg and do a daily salt shot on top of whatever dietary sodium I got turns out I was waaay off. Almost 4000mg short (I often train more than once a day).

13,A hopefully treatment option,"Hello all, I have been a part of this subreddit for about a year now. The brain fog I was experiencing took a huge toll on me and severely downgraded my quality of life. Recently, I have been liberated from this terrible cloudiness that I know plagued many of you. A couple of months ago I participated in a sleep study, and it turns out that I had sever obstructive sleep apnea. This was preventing me from being  able to maintain deep sleep, which is what your body and brain need to function properly. I have been using a c pap machine for a month now, and I can honestly say it has completely eliminated my brain fog. I encourage everyone here to participate in a sleep study, because it is much more common than you might think.

15,Success story,"I just wanted to leave a quick message. When I had brain fog this is one of the subs I came across and of course read the success stories to help me. 

&#x200B;

My success came after watching joe Rohan podcast with dr mark gordon. Especially the one earlier this year as they have a few. 

&#x200B;

He treats army vets and others who suffer from ptsd, depression, brain fog etc. He formulated 3 products. Anyways, I don’t buy his products. The ingredients are listed and I simply bought the ingredients from Amazon from products with good reviews. I also tried to use appropriate doses based on ingredient list info. If you search for his products you can find out the quantities etc from ingredient list. 

&#x200B;

I skipped the plant powder stuff like rhodisia, one of his products has a few of those. I found the quality assurance and supplier variety very low for them so didn’t trust suppliers. 

&#x200B;

Anyway his clients report being back to themselves after 3 months. The success rate is very high. I’m 2 months in and felt 50-70% reduction in symptoms depending on the day. I’ve had brain fog for 2.5 years prior to this. 

&#x200B;

I can’t remember all ingredients and don’t necessarily want to stare suppliers so just have a look at his 3 main products and buy from Amazon from sellers with good reviews. Have it with meal, like breakfast or dinner. Needed 2-3 weeks before I began feeling positive effects. 

&#x200B;

His philosophy is basically improving brain health by reducing brain inflammation. 

&#x200B;

I think main ingredients are fish oil, vit D, C, Bs (different types), Es(different types), PQQ, CoQ10, quecertin. Oh and I also use lions mane capsules personally - good for neurogenesis.

21,Things that help brain fog,"There are many causes of brain fog, including Lyme Disease, COVID, etc. I’ve had a number of health issues which I’ve used natural medicine to heal. I do a lot of research and just want to share what I have discovered works for brain fog. I primarily used the first method for my own brain fog, which helped significantly.

- Extended Fasting (Water or Juice). Fasting induces autophagy and stem cell creation. Autophagy is the process of your body ridding itself of and improving poorly functioning cells, such as immune cells, (including white blood cells), any infected or inflamed tissue, etc. The stem cell creation is the process of your body then creating new cells to replaces those cells. 

- Hyperbaric Oxygen Chamber. (I’ve tried this in the past, but before I had brain fog). Works great for brain fog related to Lyme Disease. 

- Neurofeedback. Works well for COVID brain fog from what I’ve been able to research. I’ve also called several clinics that offer this and they say they’ve treated COVID patients that had brain fog afterwards and after about 5 sessions they’ve significantly improved. 

- Ketamine infusion. You’d only be prescribed this if you have a chronic pain condition or for depression, but it is one of the few drugs that is able to cross the blood brain barrier as an anti-inflammatory. It’s one of the few that works on neuro inflammation, but for brain fog it may just be temporary improvement and you’ll need repeated doses. I’m trying to just list options here I’ve found that seem to be permanent improvement, but this seems like a good temporary option. Not sure if it works longer than just a temporary dose for some.

- Gluten and Dairy free diet. I’ve dabbled with this, planning to do it again shortly. Helps a little bit, but I didn’t do it very long. Any underlying chronic health issue I think requires a complete diet overhaul, and gluten and dairy free is a great start, even if you don’t get significant improvement right away and are doing other treatments on top, I believe a diet overhaul should be your foundation.

- Some people see huge success with grain free, much quicker, but I find that too difficult and I don’t think that’s a great long term plan as the sole treatment because avoiding grains for the rest of your life is a bit too restrictive. It can be a permanent improvement for some, but others it’s only on the diet. I think the goal is permanent improvement, so having a gluten/dairy free or some type of healthy diet as your baseline (the standard American diet is not), while pursuing other permanent options like the above is a great option. 

Some have seen rapid and permanent success of complete brain fog being healed within 5-10 days from a grain free diet, so it can always be worth a try. Others like I mentioned find it only works when they are on the diet. It’s as simple as it sounds, just avoid grains. The general diet term is a paleo diet. Some more specific grain free/gluten free programs are the Clean Program and Dr Hyman’s 10 day detox, which is essentially gluten or grain free and people have seen permanent improvement of their health issues with those, including brain fog. I’m in no way affiliated with either of those or any treatment options I’m stating here, all just what I’ve researched that seems to work for brain fog. 

I’ve no issue with anyone doing grain free long term. It works fast, but I think there are better permanent solutions out there, if it is only giving you improvement while you’re eating grain free. I also am not particularly for eating meat for personal reasons, but if it works for you great. You can do gluten/dairy free as a plant based option as well. People that are chronically ill, or have a chronic illness, generally have an immune system and inflammatory response that is not working correctly. The best way to reset that is by overhauling your diet as a baseline and then doing any treatment on top of it, of which I find natural medicine the most effective.",ob4m5t,21,0.93,8,2021-06-30 19:29:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/ob4m5t/things_that_help_brain_fog/,False,False,2021,6
22,So it turns out CBD is the culprit behind my brain fog…,"I started having brain fog, dizziness/vertigo, and fatigue a few years ago. Was diagnosed with vestibular migraine but I never really felt that gave me any answers. 

Started taking supplements, went off caffeine and alcohol and I started to eventually feel better. 

Last week my symptoms came roaring back. I started to look into what other root causes could be causing this. Anxiety, possibly sleep apnea, all the possibilities out there made me feel quite depressed. 

Then my foggy brain put some obvious clues together and I realized that I had started drinking cbd infused drinks recently. Also when my symptoms started last time I had been using a cbd cartridge. The reason I didn’t see the connection right away is that the brain fog doesn’t start instantly when I use cbd, but seems to take about a week or two. Also I’ve been a pretty long term cannabis user. I stopped the cbd and two days later I’m feeling almost back to normal. Which honestly is still pretty low energy and spacey but that just might be baseline for me. 

So I feel thankful that I’ve at least found a very large trigger for me, but also kind of stupid for doing this to myself. Also I haven’t heard of this before, and I’ve been on these forums for awhile. Not sure if it’s messing with my blood pressure or what. Also disappointed that my low key, non-alcoholic, non-pharmaceutical way to relax is gone.",nzacze,20,0.95,6,2021-06-14 00:38:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/nzacze/so_it_turns_out_cbd_is_the_culprit_behind_my/,False,False,2021,6

0,What I’ve Learned About Brain Fog and Neuroinflammation,"I suffered from chronic brain fog for 4-5 years. I’m almost an adult and it’s sad to think about me losing a large chunk of my childhood to this mysterious condition because I didn’t have it in me to do more than the bare minimum. For the first little while, I attributed it to a lack of sleep and stress, but when Covid hit and school switched to online, I still had this weird fog despite finally being able to get 10+ hours of sleep. I did some research and believed that I might have a thyroid issue but after getting super thorough blood work done and testing literally everything, it all came back completely normal, resulting in my mom insisting that I was making it up. The next year was especially terrible because I felt I had run out of options. I had tried everything including taking supplements such as niacin  but the results were short-lived and I always found myself back in square one. 

When Covid was at its peak, I noticed many people who had been infected and were suffering from long-covid described having the same symptoms as me. I tried following some of the same advice as them in the hopes I would find something that worked but it was to no avail. This is until I decided to take a summer course which had a concentration in Biochemistry (I want to go into health in uni). It was all super general stuff, but something that caught my attention in particular was the process of inflammation— particularly in the gut as well as neuroinflammation in the brain. I spent hours doing research and the longer I went on, the more clear things became to me. There is much I could get into, but to summarize, the relationship between the microbiome in the gut and your brain is direct, well documented, and responsible for many of the symptoms I’ve read occur to people on this forum.  I’ve also noticed many people with brain fog tend to have problems with addiction and/or binging which neuroinflammation has been proved to worsen. Meditation has become my best friend for two reasons: firstly, stress and living in your head makes the problem worse. Second of all, to prevent neuroinflammation, a complete purge of foods that promote it needs to be done. This includes:

-Alcohol

-Corn and things made from corn

-Nuts (this was especially difficult for me because I used to drink almond milk)

-Smoke 

-Artificial Sweeteners 

-Bread and gluten

-Sucrose and this includes high fructose corn syrup 

-Food fried in vegetable or seed oil

- Soy

-Fast food/processed junk

-Caffeine (also super hard for me)

- Beans and legumes (or soak them for 48 hours first but ideally stop until your body is back in balance)

- Cheap bad-quality meat

I know this list may seem exhaustive but by cutting out fast food and processed stuff you’re already half way there. It took me about 6 weeks for the fog to completely dissipate but it was definitely worth it. Take vitamins (B12, a B-Complex, D) if you do take niacin, make sure it’s the flush version and also look into histamines and whether that might be contributing to your state as well.

I cannot stress the importance of meditation in all of this. Even before quitting the foods, meditation was able to lessen symptoms for me greatly but only when I began to discipline myself and do things regularly. Some days are more difficult than others but the way I look at it is instant gratification will keep me where I am and resiliency is what will get me out of there. Make sure to exercise regularly as well, reduce blue light exposure (stop using your phone an hour before bed), be kind and patient with yourself, and expose yourself to the sun daily (wear sunscreen). 

I also recommend looking into grounding (stepping on the Earth without it shoes on). It sounds crazy and like some hippie crap, but I suggest reading the scientific papers or even just the top part of papers for general information. 

I pretty much lost my childhood to brain fog and mental health issues so it may sound like I’m insane, but I was willing to do anything to reclaim my life.

1,How I cured my brainfog,"I suffered with horrible brain fog for years. I have tried lots of supplemensts, without results. What worked for me is Turmeric powder(not cucurmin). This turmeric powder can be picked up at supermarket for $2 for cooking. I take 2gms with pepper everyday in the morning for the last 2 years. This has cured 80% of my Brain fog

Low dose modafinal (25mg alternate days) after adding this 10 months ago , My brain fog is 99% gone. I rarely have brain fog nowadays, maybe once a month. On those days I add-

  Paracetamol gives me temporary relief from brain fog, anxiety and adhd. I take it on days when all of 3 are severe. (500 mg)

Fresh Ginger also helped me a lot initially, but my stomach cant take it. So I take it only when needed for anxiety and brain fog, approx 2gms

I suspect I have inflammation and the above modulate it.

Edit: I have tried more than 50 supplements over the years, putting in lots of $$. I was very surprised when the simple & cheap turmeric powder worked.",ojpfcf,72,1.0,20,2021-07-13 21:27:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/ojpfcf/how_i_cured_my_brainfog/,False,False,2021,7

9,Is not being able to actually study/learn a subject well enough or not being able to retain information by heart the worst aspect of brain fog for the passionate among us?,"I'm currently struggling trying to write this piece of shit post like an absolute subhuman, wish I could express myself better even with this dreadful brain fog, Everything I want to say seems to be on the tip of my consciousness but then quickly fades away :(. I feel like I'm suffocating inside, I'm not the type of person that likes to spew out superficial nonsense, but what can I do? there's so much I want to say deep down within me and clarify things to great multitudes but I just can't.

Anyways, I think not being able to retain information that you find valuable by heart anymore is the worst or second worst aspect of brain fog (*Decreased comprehension and problem solving skills takes 1st place for the worst aspect of brain fog*).

Being able to retain things by heart means to be able to vividly recall and have these recollections welcomed into your long term memory.

Before brain fog, I used to be able to remember stuff I was passionate about so vividly and so easily too, like, the process of storing this information into my head and into my long term memory was almost instantaneous. And this is to be expected since these puzzle pieces of information make up a subject that I'm passionate about, so they obviously have great favor with my long term memory.

These days, I can't really effectively learn anything or retain anything by heart AT ALL. I'm not passionate or enthusiastic about anything anymore too. My memory in general is just multitudes worse than it used to be before brain fog. Heck, there used to be a period in my life where my memory was still perfectly intact and present in the days of my brain fog, but that obviously didn't last.

Also, I don't believe for a second that being able to retain and recall things quickly that you have high interest in or hold in high regard is some sort of exclusive trait only for geniuses, while it may require some intelligence, I doubt it requires much. I presume that being able to recall things you hold in high regard quickly and vividly is literally the natural human disposition. It's just that some have a higher capacity for it. This proves I truly am a subhuman with this awful, awful brain fog.

The only things I can recall by heart are the things that I have retained by heart before brain fog...",ofyvrm,37,1.0,7,2021-07-08 03:24:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/ofyvrm/is_not_being_able_to_actually_studylearn_a/,False,False,2021,7

11,Feels like its my eyes but I think its my brain...,"I've been struggling with brain fog for a couple years now, but recently its gotten much worse. The biggest thing for me is that my vision feels different. Its like I'm not fully here, not fully processing what I'm seeing. As if there is a film or veil in front of what I'm seeing. I feel disconnected from my environment. When I try to go for walks in nature and to feel present and alive with the elements, I can't. Its like I'm all fogged up and my heads filled with cotton or something. Its hard to describe. People have suggested dissociation - but why does it feel so physical? And why is it ALWAYS here?

I just went through a huge mental health crisis (but the fog started before that) but now the fog is even worse. I'm sleeping pretty well lately and making an effort to work out but it doesn't seem to help. The fog seems to get worse after coffee and looking at screens, but its always there. I also have a general fatigued feeling and I'm much mentally slower than usual.

I read lots of success story in this sub...too bad none is lasting. I personally contacted many of them who posted successful stories on this sub and they told me they felt good for some weeks or a couple months and then went back to feeling like shit. They are still looking for a cure. Only a few said they are still good but they never had the kind of brain fog I have...they had a temporary decreased mental capacity due to stress, depression, illness or lack of vitamin/minerals.

I also tried many of the advice read here, spent lots of money on labs, doctors and supplements and nothing really worked. An elimination diet gave me some improvement and it's what worked better among all the things I saw listed here but it didn't cure my brain fog.

Sleep apnea isn't a cause for brain fog unless you wake up feeling terrible...my brain fog gets worse as the day goes by, sleep isn't the cause.

Nobody know what cause this. Some say it's neuro inflammation, food sensitivities, autoimmune disease symptom, stress, problem with some bones or whatever. They are all theories, how many they cured?

14,Do I have brain fog?,"So I’m seeing things like bad memory, and I’m not really sure about that. But it’s like every thing has this grey film over it, not literally but like a “bleh” feeling.

And most times I feel in my head, and a lack of energy like very lazy. It feels like a dream half the time, is this brain fog?

18,Brain fog after substance use,"Hi there and thank you reading, I am glad I have found this subreddit, even though I wish the circumstances for all of us were better. 

As I am struggling finding the correct words I am reposting what I wrote before a month back. 

On the 14 of April I ingested an untested blotter of 100 ug of a psychedelic substance called 1P LSD from a known online supplier to recalibrate my perception of reality after I hit a creative low. The last time I took 1P - LSD in a macro dose was January, 2020.

My situation before this was a very sharp mind, ability to react to life circumstances with quick thinking and problem solving, able to formulate thoughts that correspond with the situation.

The trip itself did not go well as I felt a dull feeling in the right side of my head and lost my ability to express what was happening to me. I decided to leave the house together with my partner to distact myself from this experience, however felt more and more that I was not able to generate sentences in my mind or in my thoughts. In the end, this feeling became my life the next 3.5 months.

I have problems with formulating proper sentences, constant spelling problems, loss of memory, no more creativity, no ability to generate thoughts that have any meaning and not able to multi task and it is affecting my daily life. 

At work (Online customer service) I mostly survive by copy and pasting the work I did before. While at first typing the answers that solve the clients problems was effortless. 

I am already looking for professional help, and already took an MRI and the result of the MRI did not show any physical issues with the brain. I have also done blood work and my thyroid levels as well as glucose levels are normal

The loss of language and creativity is the main concern I have and many other symptoms (Tremors, higher rate of heartbeats per minute, colorless urine, pain in joints and the cognetive ones I listed before ) I suspect are the result of anxiety caused by this main concern. 

Did anyone experience this as well? If yes how long did it last for you? 

Did you notice this perhaps in a friend, did they recover? 

Could this perhaps be a chemical imbalance or an issues with the 5htp2a receptor? 

My next steps are.

- Speaking with a psychologist, at this moment there is a 10 week waiting list until the treatment can start. 

I am posting this encase any of you also took a substance and acutely developed brain fog, or if you too had nothing show up on a brain scan or blood work and are still able to function in daily life somehow. 

Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this, I hope this post will give you something to relate to if you have similar problems or atleast feel you are not alone, and I already thank you in advance if any of you recognise this from their own experience and found some kind of solution.",oshkfx,21,1.0,22,2021-07-27 06:38:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/oshkfx/brain_fog_after_substance_use/,False,False,2021,7
19,"I'm 16 and I'm losing my mind, where should I start?","First of all, sorry if the writing is not the best, I am translating this from Spanish to English, and although I consume most of the content in English, I do not feel confident to write it. I hope it is understood.

I don't know where to start, I'm 16 years old, I'll be 17 in a few months, and I've been dealing with brainfog since 2019, maybe even longer.

The truth is that I am very tired, I have been trying for months to get out of the well in which I find myself, but in recent months the only progress I have made is to start therapy, in which I have not advanced much because I do not feel confident.

I have to confess that I have recurring suicidal thoughts, but for the moment I keep them in check. This is because I am already tired of fighting all day against my lack of energy, to force myself to get up and do the same school routine online 8 hours every day, only to be exhausted at the end of the day and with a brain fog that does not let me enjoy or do anything.   Before I used to be a ""smart"" kid, I could learn the basics of a programming language in a very short time, now I can't get past the first video. I'm just tired of not being able to do what I like, or of processing information the way I did.

Finally today, I was able to force myself to write this text for help, I planned it months ago, but only today I was able.

There is also my physical health, which is not in its best state, I have been fighting a recurrent fungal infection for a couple of months and the doctors cannot figure out what to treat it, I had surgery for a cyst that was inflamed, and other things. . I know this was not caused by itself, most of it was due to my carelessness, but hey, the truth is that the last few years were not the best for me.

After this kind of introduction, my questions are:

Where should I start? Should I tell my parents? To my psychologist first? How do I avoid being taken for crazy? How do I tell them?

It is not a problem to do some research for me, although I have little periods of energy and concentration. Then come my questions about the methodology:

Where should you start investigating? Which doctor should I go to first? How should you carry out the ""investigation""? Any guides, materials, something you should see or try first? Any system that has been effective for you to organize your investigation into the cause of your brain fog?

The truth is that I do not know what else to ask, everything you can contribute about the most effective methods to investigate my condition, ideas, guides, whatever, will help. I would like to solve this as quickly and effectively as possible, I just want to live.

SYMPTOMS:

* Difficulty concentrating when doing activities or things that I don't find totally interesting.
* Difficulty understanding long sentences.
* Confusion when writing a sentence.
* Some days I have a slight confusion.
* Memory problems that vary in acuity from day to day
* Difficulty establishing relationships quickly.
* Difficulty to generate sentences quickly.
* Tiredness / fatigue almost every day, it depends on what you have to do.
* My mind clouds out of nowhere for a few seconds every now and then. I mean, I'm thinking about something and my mind goes blank out of nowhere, as if it were an extreme brain fog that lasts very little.
* Occasionally I feel a ringing in one of the ears and hear less from another for a moment.
* I have a kind of chronic cold. Basically I have a stuffy nose and smell less almost every year, with periods where the symptoms are more acute.
* Des realization from time to time

THINGS I SHOULD MENTION:

* Constipation that varies in severity from time to time for a few years. Doctors have prescribed laxatives for me sometimes, but they are only temporary solutions, they don't take it serious.
* In 2018 I abuse coffee too much to stay awake and comply with school demands, I got to drink 3 large cups of coffee per day for 3 months.
* I have an infection of what seems to be recurrent fungi 6 months ago, still doctors cannot find effective treatment. Fluconazole was not effective.
* I am constantly in a state of stress and anxiety, since I do not know how to control them.
* I lead a sedentary life, I don't exercise.
* My 2 maternal aunts have thyroid problems (hypothyroidism) and take medication. My mom also had temporary thyroid problems.
* Exposure to mold on the walls for 2-3 years (black mold not visible in the bathroom)
* Sudden high sensitivity in a part of the hand or arm.

Theories:

* Some problem in the thyroid glands.
* Neck injurement.
* Exposure to mold or toxins.
* Some problem with the immune system.

I swear to god when I get out of this shit, I'm going to do whatever I can to help people with brain fog. Thank you in advance.

I believe I am gluten sensitive, lactose intolerant, and magnesium deficient. After cutting out gluten & dairy, and taking in magnesium glycinate 400mg, it took about 3 weeks- 1 month for me to get rid of brain-fog. Side effects include rethinking career & existential crisis 😬. At the end of the day, I’m happy I made it to this point as I think this brain-fog haunted me for over 13 years 😑. Brainfog made me feel like I was living a dream. Best luck to everyone on their journey ☺️",oxmf87,167,0.99,37,2021-08-04 06:10:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/oxmf87/cleared_my_brainfog/,False,False,2021,8
1,"As someone who's fully recovered, I feel obligated to share my experiences with the community.","About 3 years ago, I had the worst period of brainfog in my entire life, I would lurk this subreddit endlessly and obsessively after getting a minor concussion, this was not my first episode of extreme brainfog but it was the most persistent.   


Anyways, since I am now at a point where I can definitively say I have fully recovered, I feel I can grant some insight into what the state of ""being in a fog"" is caused by, as well as what can be done about it.  


In my experience, an overwhelming majority of my BF was caused by obsession and fixation on the illness itself. I know that may not be a satisfying answer to most, including myself at the time, but first understand that your brain is an UNBELIEVABLY powerful thing. You NEED to understand that your state of mind will construe a world that is congruent with whatever it is you to believe to be true.   


Luckily, there is actually a lot of scientific literature that supports this phenomenon. My favourite example of this, is the study in which 2 groups of racers were split up into either being lead on to believe that they were getting slower or faster over a 30 day period, when in fact the track was being slightly augmented either longer or shorter to manipulate their times without their knowledge. At the end of the 30 day period, it was found that the group that THOUGHT they were getting slower ACTUALLY DID become slower and vice versa.   


Now to tie this in with the concept of brain fog, if you are constantly asserting to yourself that your symptoms are getting worse or that you have gotten dumber. You ACTUALLY WILL experience an influx of symptoms EVEN WITHOUT A PHYSICAL CAUSE BEHIND THEM.   


This is not to say that the clarity of mind has ZERO correlation with physical factors, as I said my worst episode of BF came after a minor brain injury. But rather to recognize that all it takes is something minor to get the ball rolling if you are prone to obsessive focus, and honestly in hindsight. I believe that the concussion played a much smaller role in my BF symptoms than my attitude towards the injury itself.  


Before I came to this realization, I would occasionally have days where I woke feeling more groggy   
than usual, something that happens to EVERY HUMAN BEING on the planet. However being in this state would cause intrusive thoughts like ""what if my brain fog is back"" and ""why do I feel so stupid right now!""  
You'd be amazed at how quickly these thoughts can make whatever minor symptom INFINITELY WORSE when you indulge in them, it truly is unbelievable how quickly I could go from feeling relatively normal to being in an overwhelming mental haze just by indulging in these thoughts.

Now imagine this is your default state, and hell, if you are browsing this sub obsessively on a day to day basis looking for some sort of reassurance IT PROBABLY IS.   


  


There is countless neuro-scientific evidence that displays that anxiety makes ANYONE dumber through a process called frontal lobe shutdown, and if you know anything about the biology of the brain you understand the importance this portion of the brain in  memory, emotions,  problem solving, social interaction etc...  


Now even if you don't think you feel ""anxious"", anxiety in principal is the fixation on an idea or outcome either conciously or subconciously to the point where it becomes an impediment to your day to day life.

In my example; I was so fixated/attatched to the ""intellectual"" mind I felt I had lost forever, however what you're fixated on doesn't even actually matter in this context. If you're obsessed with something to the point where it is autonomously occupying your mind, IT WILL stand in the way of you engaging the world around you at your full capacity. And that lack of ability to engage with things fluidly is something every brain fog sufferer can relate with.  


Now this post is getting longer than I expected it to, it may even require a part 2, but the point is...  
If you exhibit ANY of these habits of behaviour, there is potential for EXTREME cognitive deterioration REGARDLESS of if there is something physically wrong with you.  


Anyways now that you've made it to the end, I kindly ask you, to ask yourself if any of these patterns of behaviour apply to you, for if they do. You have an untapped potential to improve your mental state as a whole, in my case I saw such a dramatic improvement that it shattered my entire perception on how much power we  have to change our indiviudal condition.  


If you have any questions please drop them below and I promise I will get back to them when I have the chance!

3,Wanted to share my experience with brain fog (turns out it was hypoglycemia - preventing hypo attacks has eliminated my brain fog),"Thought this might help someone. Sharing my experience and info I learned, hoping it saves someone time, as it took me months to figure all this out.

**Issues with brain fog**

For the last 6 months probably, I was struggling deeply with brain fog. It was getting progressively worse. It was happening daily, for hours per day. I felt incredibly stupid, dissociated, and not myself, but like I was a different person. It got to the point I couldn't have conversations on the phone when it would happen because I couldn't comprehend what was being said, and also I wouldn't say words right either. This felt like a disability and prevented me from accomplishing really anything. i would even run in to the walls sometimes.

**Coinciding GI issues**

This all coincided with a GI disorder which was causing early satiety (getting full quickly from only small portions), and thus limiting how much I was eating. Initially, I brushed off the early satiety, not thinking much of it. However, I began to lose weight to the point I was underweight, and it became difficult to ignore. The worse it got, the worse my brain fog got. I didn't see this connection until later, unfortunately.

**Made connections to brain fog and eating patterns, and learned about non-diabetic reactive hypoglycemia**

This went on and on and on and on for months with no end in sight. I didn't know what this is. Anxiety? Bad diet? Stress? What's wrong with me? I started to think this is my life from now on, accept it, how awful that felt. I thought I'll give up my dreams because I can't even think. Finally, I began to notice a connection: my episodes of brain fog often occurred about 1.5 - 2 hours after eating, worsened the longer I went without eating, and tended to resolve within half an hour if I ate something. I would also get very tired sometimes after eating. I had lost a lot of weight at this point due to the GI issues, and figured my brain fog was just because I was underweight, though didn't know why. Finally I learned about non-diabetic reactive hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). The more I learned, it seemed clear this might be going on with me.

**Options to test for hypoglycemia**

I learned the best thing to do would be to test this out, so I could confirm or rule out blood sugar theory. There are two routes to do this at home: (1) a glucometer (the classic 'finger prick' device), (2) CGM ""continuous glucose monitor"" - this is actually device that gets physically attached to your body, which continuously monitors your glucose levels. (EDIT: I always thought you had to go to a doctor's office to get it attached, but apparently it's very simple to do at home. TIL.) Glucometer was a simpler route for me so that's what I explored. Info: They can be purchased quite cheaply ($20), or alternatively, a doctor can prescribe them; in addition to a glucometer, you will need test strips and lancets (the actual needles that go in it.) A doctor can prescribe all three of these things (in case this helps with insurance paying - mine paid for all three.) It is also useful to know that many glucometers will be given away free if you purchase the test strips for that device - think of them like printers - the printer itself is cheap, it is the ink (test strips) that is expensive and where they make the money.

[Here is a video I watched demonstrating how to use a glucometer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBGHCBEcPEo&t=95s) I'm assuming it might be slightly different for different glucometers, but know you can find a youtube video for yours, so you can learn how to use it. It's very simple, but takes a try or two to figure it out. P.S. - it's best to prick sort of on the side of your finger, rather than directly in to your fingertip, from what I read.

**Doctor prescribed me glucometer, lancets, and test strips and I began testing and it was hypoglycemia**

Anyway - I contacted my doctor, but no one really believed me at first. everyone brushed it off and didn't take it seriously. They put ""blood sugar dips"" in quotes in my patient notes. I do not blame them, because it probably just sounded like I randomly brought it up to them. Anyway, it got way worse and I nearly passed out one day after mighty brain fog, so I kept asking gently, finally I was prescribed a glucometer, lancets, and test strips. I began testing my blood sugar, and indeed my blood sugar was dipping in to the 40's - 50's range, which is quite low. Brain fog always came from my hypo attacks.

*Please be aware, if you do this and start testing, you need to get some baseline idea of what your blood sugar normally is, else the values you are registering probably don't mean much, as the doctors have nothing to compare it to. For example - take your blood sugar when you wake up every morning, before breakfast, same time every day. This will give you a baseline idea of what your blood sugar is in the morning (Fasting blood sugar), to compare any dips to. Keep a diligent log of every time you test your blood sugar - what time, if it's before/after eating, how long since you ate, and any symptoms you feel.*


**R.D. (dietician)'s advice to keeping hypo attacks at bay - eat balanced portions every 2-3 hours - it worked and my brain fog is gone**

My dietician began working with me to resolve this. My knowlege here is very limited, so please take any nutrition advice with a grain of salt. Anyway, she recommended to me - eat every 2-3 hours, eat meals that are balanced (balance of protein, fat, carbs).

I began doing this - eating diligently every 2-3 hours (or 3-4 hours often), and balanced things. I will tell you that this 100% cured my brain fog, and it keeps my hypoglycemia attacks at bay. I have had some bad hypoglycemia attacks recently, but each one has been due to having to fast for a medical procedure (or just neglecting to eat..). When I eat every 2-3 hours, I completely eliminate my hypoglycemia attacks, and thus my brain fog.

**Other useful info I have learned**

Here is some other useful , general information I have learned along the way: 

- [What is blood sugar, how does it work? (Short article explaining this stuff)](https://www.healthline.com/health/and-after-effect-eating-blood-sugar)

- Blood sugar (glucose) is your body's main source of energy. [Furthermore, it is virtually the ONLY source of energy for the brain, as that organ has no way to store excess energy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22436/). As a result, the brain requires a continuous source of glucose as a result. This is why cognitive symptoms start to appear when you are low on glucose - your brain is lacking energy to be fueled properly.

- Simple carbs (like sugar) digest quickly and are quickly absorbed in to the blood stream; as a result, they cause your blood sugar to quickly spike then quickly drop, which can trigger hypoglycemia. Liquids are absorbed even quicker than solids, which is why drinks like soda and sports drinks are even worse. However, pairing simple carbs with fiber (also a carb by the way), protein, and/or fat, which are digested much slower by the body, will slow the rate of absorption of glucose, and limit this crash. If you must have something with sugar, put healthy fiber, protein and/or fat with it. *EDIT: I've learned that starch (pasta, white rice, etc.) is also a type of carb, and that starch can also spike blood sugar, but I don't know if it does so as severely as simple carbs/sugar. I read a source saying it is, but other saying it's not. This should require more research, I don't have the answer, sorry..*

- If you have symptoms of a hypoglycemia attack, [consume 15g of fast-acting carbs (sugary foods without a lot of protein and fat, such as fruit juice) then recheck after 15 minutes.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypoglycemia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20373689) The issue with hypoglycemia attack is your blood sugar is too low, so your goal at this point is to raise and stabilize your sugar levels. Once the attack subsides, have a small snack or meal. My dietician said the best thing during blood sugar low is 100% pure fruit juice because of how quickly the body breaks it down. 

- Doctor told me to look out for sweaty palms when I feel symptoms; this can be an indication of a hypoglycemia attack.

- Hypoglycemia is serious - left untreated it can lead you to lose consciousness, have seizures. In rare cases, death. Don't ignore it if your blood sugar falls too much.

- If you are lower weight, you might feel the effects of lowered blood sugar, such as brain fog, more harshly. My doctor explains to me that if you are at a normal weight, your body has stores of energy it can start to break down (fat and muscle), but the lower weight you get, your body just doesn't have as much of these energy stores, and you are sort of ""running on empty"". She says, a normal person will walk around with blood sugar of 75 which is normal, and have no idea, but at a very low weight, even you might feel the effects of blood sugar getting this low. I'm probably saying this incorrectly, but this is what was relayed to me in so many words, and it was interesting for me to learn this.


**Little more info : I have no nutritional deficiencies, my A1c and fasting blood sugar were normal, even still I have hypoglycemia.**

A little bit more about myself: I had a metabolic panel done to rule out any nutritional deficiencies. I was not anemic, I had no vitamin or mineral deficiencies. Additionally, my A1c levels were normal, and my fasting glucose level was only 69 (only 1 point below 70, which is the typical 'normal' thershold). Another reason why it was a hard sell to my doctors that this was going on.

**There are multiple possible causes for non-diabetic hypoglycemia; malnutrition and low body weight is one, and this is likely the cause in my case.**

It turns out that [malnutrition, in the form of low body weight and wasting muscle, can actually cause hypoglycemia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK355894/), due to limited substrates for gluconeogenosis. This is likely what's going on with me, and my doctor fully believes that once I get back to a normal weight, my hypoglycemia will reverse. It's something to keep in mind if you are in a similar situation.

**Simple, unbiased advice if you think this might be going on, but can't access a glucometer or CGM, or a doctor**

Seriously, if you think this could at all be a possibility for you - I would suggest trying my R.D.'s advice - eat every 2-3 hours, and eat balanced things. Don't eat meals that are high in sugar by itself - pair carbs with fiber and fat, to slow the rate of glucose uptake. If this sounds intimidating - this doesn't have to be a permanent change - just try it for a few days to see if this helps with the brain fog, like an experiment. So just two things to do here : (1) make sure you are eating every 2-3 hours (or 3-4 perhaps) (2) what you eat should be balanced; if there's sugar / carbs, pair it with fiber, protein, and/or fat.

I have read conflicting things about what to eat; a doctor told me to eat balanced meals that are high-protein and low-carb (to avoid spikes/dips), but my R.D. didn't care for this, and just wants me to eat balanced portions. To be honest I am not currently doing anything special like lowering carbs, and I am able to keep my hypo attacks at bay. I'm not sure what's the wisest strategy in the long term, I'm yet to learn and figure that out, I'm only sharing what is working for me in the moment.

My GI issues have severely limited my diet right now, but here is what I eat, in case it's useful. This regiment 100% controls my hypo attacks and brain fog, but I wouldn't recommend others copy it - it's limited due to my situation, and not ideal.. : (1) Plain oatmeal topped with natural (no salt or sugar added) peanut butter, cinnamon, olive oil, and some raisins. (The oil is for extra calories.) I have this twice daily - once upon waking and once in later afternoon. Each oatmeal is broken in to two portions, spaced about an hour apart, as I can't eat the entire thing at once. (2) Ensure Plus with added fiber (2 per day), which I space throughout the day (i portion about 1/3 of a bottle at a time, with portions split about an hour or so apart). (3) In between i have bread or cracker with natural peanut butter on it. (4) For drinks - only water, unless I get a hypo attack, then I drink 100% pineapple juice or sprite. I do NOT recommend this as a healthy diet plan - I eat this limited only because of my GI situation. Regardless, eating these things, and not going more than 3 hours between consuming something, is completely eliminating my brain fog so I'm just sharing.  I also have a multivitamin.

**Caveat about nutrition stuff above**

There's so much debate about the healthiest ways to eat, so please consider your own personal situation. For example, there is debate on if you should eat frequently, or fast, all this stuff. There's debate about carbs. I don't claim to know anything about any of this - I am only sharing what's working in my current situation, in case it helps someone else. I do not know if this is the optimal way to eat, or if my approach is harmful long term. At least it is something for me to start with, which is a vast improvement of previous times, and which I can continue to learn and improve upon.


Anyway, I am not assuming anyone or most people here are in this situation, but maybe even one person is and this info can save them the months of problems I went through coming to this point.

**EDIT: About a year since I posted this, and in case anyone ever reads it and it could be helpful, I want to share. It turns out my hypgolycemia was happening due to malnutrition. I was incredibly underweight due to an (at the time) untreated GI disorder. I had a very difficult time eating. This led to my body's glycogen stores being severely depleted. After food was digested, my body had no glycogen to break down to create glucose from. I've been able to get back to a normal weight since getting my GI issue treated, and my blood sugar issues are MUCH better. However, when it is low, I almost always get brain fog, and that's usually what tips me off. Eating good, healthy food, lots of complex carbs has helped in building up my glycogen stores.

4,I STRUGGLED FOR YEARS. IT WAS ADHD.,"That, or ADHD medication just happens to alleviate my symptoms.

I'll give you the short version, but please feel free to ask as many questions as you'd like. For those of you who have been in this struggle for years now, I know how it is and how infrequently these success stories come up.

Basically, after about 4 years of searching for answers for my brain fog (difficulty communicating, remembering words and names, inability to process information), my friend mentioned the **ADHD iceberg** — a list of symptoms ""below the surface"" (i.e. not always talked about but encompass the fuller, deeper range of ADHD symptoms). After looking into it, I'd realized many of the symptoms on there were symptoms I'd struggled with on a daily basis. Got diagnosed and here we are.

If you do get tested and discover that it's ADHD, if you choose to be medicated, understand that there's high variation in efficacy amongst the generic manufacturers of Adderall. ~~If you do get diagnosed,~~ hop onto r/ADHD. ~~But that's a bridge to cross once you get here.~~

It's not easy where you are. I'm proud of you all. Good luck.

EDIT: Don't just hop onto that subreddit *if* you've received a diagnosis. That couldn't be further from the truth, as it's valuable even during your journey towards diagnosis (whether that be of ADHD or any other possibility). There are so many success stories on there from people who'd struggled to find out what was 'wrong' with them until they were diagnosed. Even if it doesn't end up being ADHD for you, their stories may be encouragement you need.",p7joy3,51,0.98,25,2021-08-19 17:41:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/p7joy3/i_struggled_for_years_it_was_adhd/,False,False,2021,8
5,My Brain Fog Drained My Hope & Now I am Suicidal,"The title says it all .. I am about to lose my job and maybe my life too. Doctors have failed me. If anyone of you guys had similar symptoms to mine and managed to break out of this prison, I beg him/her to message me. My weird symptoms are:

\- Difficult time speaking fluently (I used to be extremely fluent).

\- Difficult time speaking articulately (I used to be articulate & now I cannot find the right word for anything).

\- Decrease in cognitive abilities (reasoning, abstract thinking ...etc).

\- When I stare at a screen, I literally feel as if my brain structure is changing & I become extremely dumb afterwards. This is accompanied with blurry vision. On the other hand, when I read from a book, my symptoms get better.

\- I cannot experience emotions properly.

&#x200B;

I have tried many solutions, the one that made me feel better:

\- Cutting out gluten and dairy: I become able to focus for longer but my cognitive ability remains decreased. 

\- Extreme exercise (e.g. playing competitive sports): Post exercise, I have 12-24 hours of semi-clear brain but that does not last for long as I start feeling a change in my brain structure and I become a dumb guy again.

13,A combination that works for me,"Hi everyone! I wanted to post on here because for the greater part of the past year and a half I have been STRUGGLING with depression, anxiety, and brain fog. I finally feel like I have a good grip on all three, and here’s what I’ve done that has helped:

First - Sorting out your emotions. 

This is super important. Brain fog generally is a symptom of underlying depression and anxiety. When the depression, anxiety, and pain from the past hasn’t been processed in the system (both body and mind), then brain fog can be the bi-product. Brain fog comes because the brain isn’t able to focus on “menial tasks” like focusing, reading, speaking when it believes it’s in a state of distress and danger. Meaning, if you are depressed and anxious, and not fully cognizant of that, then the brain will focus on trying to remove itself from those dangers, before it will get back to focusing on the “menial tasks”. Heal the depression and anxiety in your system, and you heal the brain fog.

Second - Diet

As mentioned by many other people in here, this is very important. The brain gut connection is no joke. 90% of your serotonin comes from your gut. And if your gut isn’t working properly, it’ll be easy to end up with brain fog. So find out what works, and what feels good for you and your body, and just remember to not stress too much about it, and not be extremely strict (unless that feels good to you!). With my situation, I have cut out most wheat (because Glyphosate and gluten can cause havoc on our systems), cut out most dairy (aside from ghee), and cut out refined sugars (I still love honey and use it every day in my morning beverage which I’ll get to later). I also do my best to eat an alkaline diet. Look it up. It definitely has helped me too. So overall, do some research on low inflammation foods, and alkaline diets, and experiment with what works. Just don’t forget that your mind can cause so many more problems than the foods you eat, so never stress too hard about what you eat or it will become bad for you :)

Lastly - Supplements

Supplements help your brain not have to do so much work on its own. And gosh have I found the set up. Now, the only thing is I pay around $150-200 per month for this regiment, but for me it works well, so it’s worth it to me. 

First, In the mornings I drink an adaptogenic mushroom “coffee” called Mud Wtr. It is the single best thing I’ve done to help the brain fog. It contains a lot of anti inflammatory spices, and health mushrooms such as reishi, Chaga, lions mane, and cordyceps. It’s been unreal. Next, in the morning I take fish oil, citocholine, 10000 iu vitamin D, 400 mg of SAMe, and a multivitamin. Lastly, I drink about 3-7oz of kombucha for probiotics. At night I take zinc, magnesium, and another round of adaptogenic mushrooms (not the mud wtr, but Mycobotanicals Stress Decompress blend).

This refinement has helped so much, and I hope it helps someone else!! And remember, try not to put too much attention in your brain fog. What you put your attention on always grows!",p6gzh1,22,0.9,17,2021-08-18 01:14:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/p6gzh1/a_combination_that_works_for_me/,False,False,2021,8

15,"POTS without the ""T""","I noticed a couple of posts on this board from folks who discovered they had POTS and were able to get some relief from their brain fog by getting treated for POTS. I noticed comments from other readers saying ""That sounds a bit like me but I don't have tachycardia"" (racing heart).

I just wanted to let people know that POTS is just one form of orthostatic intolerance (OI) – when your body doesn't manage your blood flow properly when you move from lying down to sitting to standing. It can also hit you when you sit or stand still for a long period.

So even if you don't have heart palpitations or a certain abnormal rise in heart rate when you are tested, you can still have orthostatic intolerance.

The treatment is somewhat similar to the treatment for POTS, except you wouldn't be prescribed heart medications (e.g. beta blockers) in the absence of HR or BP abnormalities.

Orthostatic intolerance is mostly diagnosed by the symptoms, and by whether your symptoms are (somewhat) relieved by sitting or lying down, or moving about (if they come on when you are still for too long). Other considerations could be low blood volume (not the same as dehydration, but rather that the fluid in your body isn't distributed properly) and abdominal pooling after eating (it's normal for blood to be diverted to your abdomen for digestion, but in some people this makes them feel lightheaded or faint).

There is some research going on into OI without tachycardia, which you can read about here:

[https://www.brighamandwomensfaulkner.org/about-bwfh/news/expanded-autonomic-testing-helps-to-pinpoint-cases-of-orthostatic-intolerance](https://www.brighamandwomensfaulkner.org/about-bwfh/news/expanded-autonomic-testing-helps-to-pinpoint-cases-of-orthostatic-intolerance)

Hope this might help someone. I read about POTS years ago, but thought ""that can't be me"" because I didn't have heart or BP symptoms. Turns out I probably have OI. Just waiting to see specialist for confirmation.

Who can you get help from? Cardiologist, neurologist, physiotherapist.

Check videos on YouTube or Vimeo from Dr Peter Rowe, Dr Nick Gall, Dr Satish Raj. OI is often covered (briefly) in videos about POTS, dysautonomia or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. There isn't a huge amount out there about OI alone, so you need to do a bit of searching.",ozuzkz,21,1.0,9,2021-08-07 15:09:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/ozuzkz/pots_without_the_t/,False,False,2021,8

1,My brain fog was 100% a symptom of major depressive disorder,"My brain fog has been abolished by the antidepressant Parnate (tranylcypromine). For years I suffered from fog because my poor brain was trying to function normally with an abnormally low supply of dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin. In fact, brain fog was the very first symptom of depression which hit me; I had it for almost a year before I was beset by traditional depression characteristics such as melancholy, suicidality, disturbed sleep and poor cognition. I can only describe my fog as the continuous perception that my brain was struggling to work without enough blood and oxygen. In reality there were not enough neurotransmitters for my neurons to fire normally, and this created the constant fog. 

The truth is that over the years I have spent a few thousand dollars on various supplements and 'nootropics' to try to ""naturally"" resolve my depression but the only treatment that has helped me is Parnate (I also got temporary relief from depression and fog from stimulants like Adderall and Ritalin, as well as 5-HTP). I also tried significantly improving my diet and doing cardio exercise (jogging) 3-4 times per week but any benefit I received from these changes pales in comparison to Parnate.",psxaq5,115,1.0,26,2021-09-22 01:48:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/psxaq5/my_brain_fog_was_100_a_symptom_of_major/,False,False,2021,9

4,UPDATE ON MY BRAINFOG! WORTH A READ!,"Hi guys I've been on this subreddit for a while and have been suffering from severe brainfog since January/February 2021. I just wanted to share my experience and some of the extensive testing I've done and plans I have to try and eliminate this condition. So long story short my life has been a pretty traumatic one and there has been a plethora of ups and downs. But last year (2020) I had a wide variety of peculiar events occur that could have caused or even contributed to my brainfog. 

For me the fog started minorly at the start of last year (2020) As I noticed I was becoming forgetful and forgetting small things and couldn't focus on class at my course and had extreme anxiety 24/7. I dubbed the brainfog ""cognitive dissonance"" at the time, I had no idea what the hell it was and never really took much notice of it just pressed on. But it felt like my head was maybe about 10-20% clouded like some sort of foggy cotton wool feeling within my head. It progressed from there and got worse as the year went on and I thought it could possibly be depression because I was sad most of the year and was experiencing low energy and mood swings. I also abused alcohol most of last year to combat my crippling social anxiety that had also got worse during that year since 2017. But alas during the year my mental state worsened and I had massive amount of stressful upsetting events happen during that time and things just got worse and worse. Then I was involved in a car accident, lost my car, was falsely accused of rape 2x and had people threating to kill me, and lost all my money to the car accident, drunk heavily daily on and off throught the year, and left my course in business management that I wanted to do it cost me 5k.

Then my brainfog went from minor to severe on January 18th 2021. At 1am on January 18th I woke up from a severe nightmare drenched in sweat with brainfog, derealization, vertigo, vomiting, diahorrea, foggy vision, anxiety. I remember walking around the house and getting a glass of water and feeling like I had been poisoned as I felt like I was drunk/high and the fog was 10/10 I was absolutely terrified and went into the fetal position crying and asking God to save me. Before this I had been drinking heavily and working late night shifts as well as staying with my girlfriend and not sleeping much. I thought it could possibly be alcohol withdrawls and I stayed clear of any alcohol or anything for the next 3-weeks and symptoms went away but I still had minor brainfog but the symptoms went away mostly. Then on February 2nd I went on a holiday and had vertigo and ear pain on the way down on the car ride. Then on February 6th I stayed at my gf's and decided to smoke marajuiana and drink 2x bottles of wine and some beer. I felt quite foggy but was able to function well enough and everything was fine for the next few days until February 8th when I caught a virus that gave me severe sore throat: like swallowing nails, fever, chills, coughing up yellow flem, running nose, diahorrea, vertigo, pretty much just a severe flu.

I was normal until February 10th then the exact same symptoms I experienced on January 18th came back and I woke up with derealization, short-term memory issues, apathy, adehonia, hypgogic hallucination, visual snow, eye floaters, foggy vision, after images, hypnic jerk, anxiety, OCD tendencies, sadness and depression, suicidal idealation, diahorrea, sensitivity to light, de-ja-vu, and severe brainfog head feels like its filled with cotton wool and foggy and loss of cognitive functions, stuffy sinuses, I went to the ER and they gave me psychiatric medication which did nothing to help me. I obsessively googled and researched what this condition could be? I found dr/dp and followed all the recovery steps, I tried therapy, exercise, getting a job at an orchard working full-time, sleep changes, diet changes, taking a multi-vitamin, a bunch of different things, no difference in condition. Then I really started to panic and went on a multi-month health anxiety chase to try and fix this condition, getting so many tests done and a bunch of other stuff. 

So as of now it's been about 7 or 8 months since this all started and as of now my symptoms are now:

SEVERE DAILY BRAINFOG: Every day my head feels covered in a thick fog that doesn't go away and prevents me from feeling mentally clear and I just feel like my head is full of cotton wool and like I dumb or an idot, almost like I have a head cold 24/7.

MEMORY & COGNITION ISSUES: I often can't remember what I did yesterday and forget small things and what I did weeks prior my memory feels completely shot and messed up and when I try to remember a certain event I can't but when I am just randomly doing something memorys come back to me. My memory used to be crystal clear and I was able to recall events from when I was as young as 4 in great detail, that all seems to have disappeared too. Also my cognition is massively slowed I feel alot slower and dumber than I used to and it takes me way longer to understand abstract concepts than I used to also my brain just feels slow and foggy all the time also my imagination is basically nonexistent. I used to have a absolutely amazing imagination and was very, very creative all of that has gone. Feels like dementia tbh. 

LOW ENERGY: Pretty self explanatory. 

DAILY SADNESS & SUICIDAL IDEALATION: For some reason I have a treatment resistant depression now that antidepressants and therapy can't touch I take 30mg of Mirtzapine every night have have done for about 3 months but im not feeling any different. I also cry everyday and get automated suicidal thoughts that are severe and make me crawl up into a ball and cry due the severity of this condition and how bad it makes me feel. This switches between depression then OCD, obsessively googling this condition and my symptoms daily and worrying about how it will effect me in the future. 

APATHY & ANHEDONIA: I have lost all desire to do anything and just feel empty, depressed and emotionless, even sex has lost its appeal to me as prior I was always keen to chase women and have sex, I can't feel happy or excited anymore or even anxious all I feel is extreme debilitating sadness, and just tired or feeling this way. I don't even know what to talk about with people anymore I just feel extremely sad and down and emotionless. 

DIZZYNESS/OFF BALANCE FEELING: This started a couple months ago and it feels almost like im walking on a bouncy castle when I'm walking around you know how your feet drop down etc. That kind of feeling its like a dizzyness/off balance feeling or there is an earthquake like a rocking feeling. 

VISUAL SNOW & EYE FLOATERS/FOGGY VISION: My vision used to be extremely foggy but turned crystal clear after a while which was good I also have visual snow now so when I look up in the sky I just see what seems like small particles flying around and if I look at something bright I will see after images which I never did prior.

TESTING DONE: MRI of head w/o Contrast, CT scan of head w/o Contrast, X-Ray of neck, 3x Eye tests w/ peripheral vision check, hearing test and ear examination, stool test, urine test, testosterone/cortisol, NMDAR Serum Antibodies, Sleep apnea check. I have also ruled out any possible vitamin deficiency because I take mass doses of B-Complex, Vitamin D, Mangesium, Calcium & Zinc, Vitamin B1 and Vitamin C and and neurological exam ruling out any neurodegerative disease. All these normal or low normal. 

BLOODS DONE: NMDA & NMDAR Antibodies, 2x Serum Thiamine, Sex Binding Protein, Caeruloplasmin, Serum Ammonia, B12/Folate, Iron, Thyroid TSH, T3, T4, Liver, Gluclose, 3x ANA's, RF, Immunoglobulin, IgE, CRP, Renal function, Calcium Phosphate, Thyroid Antibodies, Vitamin D, Copper, Magnesium, Mercury, Testosterone, Cortisol, Lipids, Prothrombin Ratio, Celiac Antibodies, Fecal Heliobactor Ag test, Zinc, Creatine, Antineuronal Antibodies: Negative for anti-hu, Ri, Yo, Ma1, Ma2, anti-CV2/CRMP5, Amphiphysin, Sox-1, Zic-4, Tr, Titin, Recoverin paraneoplastic antibody. And a couple more I can't remember lol. All bloods normal or low normal there were some slight minor abnormalities but nothing that would explain symptoms. 

CONCLUSION: So as you can see I've had a extremely massive clinical work up I honestly don't know whats wrong with me or what's causing this brainfog or the symptoms I have daily. I have 3 pretty strong ideas though as to what's causing it and how to fix it.

IDEA-1: Alcohol related brain damage. This could possibly explain everything I believe I could have possibly become deficient in Vitamin B1 due to my excessive drinking last year, which would explain January 18th after binge drinking and alcohol withdrawls exacerbate Thiamine deficiency so that's an explanation as to why this is happening so I could essentially be suffering from a mild form of Korsakoff Syndrome due to going undiagnosed for so long and not realising I needed Thiamine replenishment and magnesium replenishment but my magnesium was low normal on May 11th. I also began taking a cheap multi-vitamin around early March so that would have replenished some lost vitamins. If it was Korsakoff's it would have caused permanent irreversible brain damage. But this is relatively unlikely because I've had 1st and 2nd opinion in my CT scans and MRI films to specifically analyse them for autoimmune encephalitis and wernicke-korsakoff and korsakoff damage or any slight abnormalities relating to those conditions. I also taught myself how to analyse MRI scans and spent hours going over my MRI and comparing it to those with Wernicke-Korsakoff features. No enlargement of ventricles or lesions or anything perfectly normal brain. I have been taking mass doses of Thiamine - (Vitamin B1) and B-Complex and Magnesium just incase it is this though. 

IDEA-2: Autoimmune-Encephalitis or Autoimmune- Limbic Encephalitis possibly with GAD antibody or with unidentified antibody. Also Auto-immune Encephalitis with GAD antibody and Limbic system can last for years leaving people undiagnosed. This is also still quit likely as It would explain alot of my suffering and considering I remember having a slight sore throat before any of this started in January so that may point to that conclusion and alcohol use and stress could have lowered my immune system and made me weaker to virus I was also smoking alot back then too. I may have had a latent virus that would explain the vertigo and ear pain too and possibly the symptoms that night on January 18th it it were Korsakoff's it would have just progressed straight to it without making stops or events like my story had. My immunoglobulins were also all low meaning my immune system chronically low I also have low level inflammation going on in my body too because I sometimes get readings of 1-3 on CRP and on RF factor tests which signifies low level inflammation. This could also be some sort of auto-immune mediated thing too. 

IDEA-3: MCAS or some sort of mental illness or psychiatric manefestation. I don't really know any mental illness that would cause these symptoms but I do no, no single psychiatric medication has helped any of my symptoms at all. As for MCAS that's also a possibility too.

FUTURE PLANS: So from now I plan to get a spinal tap, SPECT scan, PET scan to finalise what this might be. If it is brain damage I plan to do Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy ASAP and try to heal the damage because I have slightly improved overtime throughout this year. I also plan to get off the antidepressants because I believe they are just making things worse. I have made a set routine for myself which I will follow for months and see if that makes any difference I really, really want to beat this condition and fix myself and I will do anything in my power to do so. THANK YOU! If you read this far and please stay strong I promise when I rid myself of this condition or find anything treatment that helps I wi report back here as soon as I can and share it with you guys. We can get through this! Please stays tlng guys.

6,Thinking of suicide?,"Twice now in two weeks members of some sub-reddit’s I follow have posted about how they were thinking of committing suicide… Then never posted again. (Linked below).

Firstly I hope you guys are still out there!… And if not I hope you guys have found peace.

If anyone else is thinking of ending it please don’t! Things can improve but only if you hang in there!

Now I’m not a doctor or a phycologist but I am a dude that has suffered years of depression, fatigue and brain fog and have a pretty good handle on it to the point I would say I’m now thriving.

If you are thinking of ending it reach out! Send me a message and I will take some time to chat with you, via phone if needed! Like I said I’m no professional but talking to someone has to be better then no one right?!

I will be putting aside a bit of time each morning to check my messages and will do my best to respond as soon as I can.

Please all! Hang in there! Things will get better!

7,I feel like half the person I was.,"Since last year, something’s happened to me - but I can’t tell what. My motivation has gone down, my memory has been god awful, my intelligence has been slashed in half, it feels like my instincts have been dulled, simple things don’t make sense, and I’ve been getting headaches a lot.

I came across brain fog after searching my symptoms up, and they line up almost perfectly.

I don’t really know what to do, other than fix my routine that I messed up during COVID. I’m scheduled for a checkup with my doctor soon, but I’m worried this is something that I can’t just fix even after a bunch of tests.

8,Speech Issues - Cluttering,"I’m to the point with this where I can’t even formulate a simple sentence without jumbling up and mispronouncing my words. I second guess my words because some of the things I say just feel “off”; like the word choice or placements don’t make sense. Even when I know what I want to say, it just comes out cluttered. Talking has become such an intense task in itself that I can’t even keep track of the conversations. This is new. 

It’s like this - a simple sentence is made up of a puzzle in your head. The individual puzzle pieces are words and phrases. Easy enough to put together if you have ample time, but conversations involve split second responses, so trying to put together a puzzle in that time is near impossible. This is what brain fog does to my speech, and by the time you know what you want to say and how you want to say it say it, it’s more than likely now irrelevant to the conversation. You then also want to focus on the elements of your facial expression, body language, voice (tonality, inflection, volume), etc. to communicate your point, but it just adds to the pressure of talking. It makes communicating quite difficult. Anyone else struggle with speech issues as a result of brain fog that they never had before? Ie cluttering, stuttering, etc.?

I had an MRI, EEG, and blood work done and everything came back clear. I was diagnosed, however, officially with ADHD through a formal cognitive exam just last week, which didn’t come as much of a shock since I always had attention issues, but these current symptoms are new and excessive, and I just don’t feel like it should be causing this many issues with speech.",pu7979,30,1.0,9,2021-09-23 23:19:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/pu7979/speech_issues_cluttering/,False,False,2021,9
9,Brain Fog update,"Hi all,

I wanted to give you all an update. After having brain fog for almost 2.5 years it has finally improved to the point where I can say I feel better. My brain isn’t 100 but I’m finally able to retain information and not feel the awful effects of feeling stupid all the time. I’m not 100% to what I used to be but being on a keto vegetarian diet has helped. I started adding collagen to my coffee and taking vitamins D and vitamin B12. After seeing my lab results it seemed liked my levels were low. Also I dropped 35 lbs in the process. It may have been hormone caused because my daughter is turning two this week. It was like a lot of people said, one day you just wake up and it’s gone. I have been brain fog free for a whole month now. Hopefully it doesn’t come back.",po56ji,29,0.98,6,2021-09-14 15:36:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/po56ji/brain_fog_update/,False,False,2021,9
10,How would you describe the impact of brain fog on your communication abilities?,"I'll start with a description I wrote recently on my [blog](http://wherearemypillows.com/?p=2104):

""To compose a sentence on my worst days, I have to move through multiple layers of translation. 

On the highest level, my mind perceives the vague contours of a thought that’s enshrouded in fog. On the next, I reach through the fog only to realize there are no words to grasp on to. 

Somewhere in the middle, after using a cloth and some elbow grease, parts of the fog dissipate. 

Then it’s on to the chisel, where I onerously contort my arm from multiple wrong angles until it finds the right one to carve from. 

Finally, I find myself having drilled down to the lowest level… lo and behold, ladies and gentleman, we have ourselves

—\*drumroll\*—

ONE. SINGLE. SENTENCE.""

11,100% discovered the cause of my brain fog.,"So I’ve taken adderall with a prescription since I was in 3rd grade. So since I was about 11/12 years old. I always kind of had a hunch that this is what made my brain so sluggish and so difficult to think but I wasn’t sure. This past summer and last semester I took off school and work and just relaxed. Didn’t take my drugs, I did still drink and smoke weed on occasion though. However, my brain fog totally went away. At the start of this semester I was so relieved because I could actually think again. Unfortunately, I ended up taking my adderall this past Monday and ever since then my brain fog has been back. It was literally like an immediate switch back. I can’t think again and I need to relax and get my mojo back.

12,My B.F. may have been due to prolonged stress/anxiety,"Hello all,

I have come to the conclusion that my brain fog (B.F.) is due to my frequent anxiety and panic attacks during the year 2020 after separating from the military. I am healthy in every aspect except for controlling my impulses to work and focus intently. For example, I used to think my brain was very high performing because I could accomplish so much, have so many tasks going on, and such an in depth understanding of things. However, failure to do so lead to me becoming irrationally upset with myself. Two cases are me going to college and trying to body-build, meanwhile adjusting to civilian life and living at home with my parents (also very stressful). Failure in these areas lead me to aggressively stress and I continued to put off the side effects. I would get frontal headaches (right behind forehead) and my orbitals would feel exhausted. I would be very irritable with those who I loved and shut myself in my room. The isolation and stress then lead to anxiety and panic attacks. The kind that happen 3-5 times a week, the kind that make you get up from a meal with your family and go hyperventilate on a walk, the kind that leave you with a headache the next day.

Ive come to the realization that this is my issue and my brain has to be rewired. I really want to figure out how to do this. I eat healthy, train in the gym, sleep somewhat well, hydrate. But the one area Im lacking is meditation. I hope that year of stress didn’t ruin me for life.

What are your thoughts? Have any of you recovered from and chronic stress/anxiety induced brain fog?

Best,

15,Update!!!,"So last week I made a post about me finally identifying what’s causing the brain fog and just to give u a synopsis of the prior post I basically figured out that my neck was causing the fog. And as I said in the other post this is gonna sound crazy, but as soon as I said “damn I think my neck is what’s causing the fog” I instantly felt a little better. Maybe my Brain was finally like finally  you found the culprit. So In the other post I said I was using a heat pad which was relieving the tension in my neck thus mitigating the fog, but the last couple of days I haven’t been using it and I still feel good. I feel about 80-85 percent clear of the fog. The only thing I’ve been doing is taking a lot of anti inflammatory herbs. Such as aloe Vera, turmeric, chamomile, and omega 3s. I also found out that my scalp psoriasis might be causing inflammation too but usually throughout the day it’s gets better. So hopefully this post can give someone clarity and hope that you to can figure out what’s causing the Brain fog. I do still recommend checking my previous post. Oh and by the way I really don’t think staying away from gluten,sugar, dairy etc will cure brain fog. I just recommend u don’t eat it excessively. I’ve been pretty much eating whatever I want and I still feel fine. So if u made it this far sorry for the long story and hopefully I gave y’all some insight . Have a good weekend!

17,I forgot an entire person I was talking to for months...,"Part of my brain fog is that everything just feels like a dream - a distant memory belonging to someone else. Events from a year ago seem like a lifetime ago, and things from the other week seem like last year. I'm 41, and sometimes it feels like I remember my 20's better than the last 5 years. That's bad enough, but what I'm about to describe is a bit worrying.

I was recently clearing space on my phone, and part of that was deleting old attachments from messages. In doing so, I found an old conversation with a girl from a dating app that lasted about 3 months... and I had almost no recollection of her or the chat. 

I kind of want to give myself a break, because it took place during lockdown, we never actually met, and in addition to Covid I had a lot of other drama going on. It's possible I had a few conversations going on as well.   


But... this was a 3 month long convo, with pics exchanged, and cool things were said... and I remembered almost none of it until one photo sort of jogged my memory ever so slightly. This girl wasn't ""forgettable"" by the way. She seemed great, and we had a fun chat until it just stopped one day.  


As I kept going through the phone, I found a few more people I really should have remembered, but the convo's weren't as long or as full on, and they were a little more familiar.  


Has anyone ever done anything like this? And do you attribute it to your brain fog, or something else?

\- Vision problems; vision is more blurry than it used to be, visual snow, floaters, depth perception issues.

\- Headaches and pressure in my head, feel it especially at the back area of my head and neck. My head also feels heavy, like it's full of water.

\- Emotional numbness/flatness.

\- No motivation or drive to do anything.

\- Fatigue and tiredness.

8,I think my brain fog and the rest of my health issues are caused by my neck injury," 

This could end up to be a long post but I will try to shorten it as much as I can.

I have anhedonia, brain fog, dissociation, fatigue, sudden hair fall out of nowhere and other symptoms. I have been struggling for almost 3 years with such hardships and I still haven't discovered the cause of my problems. It influences my life and ability to exist in this world and environment and it's very hard to proceed this way. Anyways, I have never had any psychological problems or stress that could have caused this, I have never consumed any psychiatric drugs or such, I have never abused any substances that could have gotten me in this situation. Everything was just fine before this happened. I have tested my hormones, they weren't the issue.

So the last remaining guess of what could the cause be is, well few days before all these problems set in, it was the summer of 2019 I remember moving my neck backwards in a bad way while trying to crack it and I got neck stiffness somewhere between my C5-C6-C7 vertebrae and I had pain that extended like electric shock from the stiffness to my right shoulder plate - as if a needle was poking me. And precisely few days after the stiffness went away, anhedonia, brain fog and the rest set in. Now the pain is gone but I can still feel the area in a way, and when twisting my neck, especially the part that starts at the trap muscles is always makes cracking/popping sounds. I also had random outbursts of allergic rhinitis and I read that it could be something with the sinuses that it impacted by the same cause.

I think this instability/pain could have done something to the blood flow to the brain and resulted in me being this way. I read that it can block the signaling towards the brain and I think that it must have disrupted some signaling going from my spine into my brain or something and also made it harder for my body to properly absorb whatever it needs like how it used to prior. And I found an article which could explain that as well: [https://www.caringmedical.com/prolotherapy-news/cervical-spine-instability-pinches-arteries-disrupts-impedes-retards-blood-flow-brain/?fbclid=IwAR3ALYHZl3ovQHiLgJFHiH-oCTs687T3VUo-Xx6DFVfVAVdgI2j8Rk7ZCYs](https://www.caringmedical.com/prolotherapy-news/cervical-spine-instability-pinches-arteries-disrupts-impedes-retards-blood-flow-brain/?fbclid=IwAR3ALYHZl3ovQHiLgJFHiH-oCTs687T3VUo-Xx6DFVfVAVdgI2j8Rk7ZCYs)

Well I also have bladder issues, pain in the epididymis and the canals leading to the prostate. I also had inguinal hernia which popped out of nowhere few months after anhedonia, brain fog etc. I had a surgery in February for it. I saw a post here from a person that claimed their mental and physiological problems could be caused from a spinal problems/degenerations.

So is anyone familiar with this? Could this possibly cause my issues? I would appreciate every answer and I apologize if this was a long post.",q02c8e,29,1.0,5,2021-10-02 20:04:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/q02c8e/i_think_my_brain_fog_and_the_rest_of_my_health/,False,False,2021,10

I can’t really think or feel clearly, like my brain gears are clunking along irregularly. It takes a little longer for me to process responses, and sometimes I give back shallowed ones I only realize are shallow after looking back at them. It takes a bit amount of effort to understand from another’s point of view, because my gears are dysfunctional and slowing down.

All of the time, I promise myself I’ll complete a set of tasks to accomplish a goal I want to pursue, but I get sucked in again to the hole that is endless dopamine surfing (hence why I’m a part of r/nosurf). I waste whole days just reading junk from the internet that doesn’t serve me any good, yet I don’t often realize until the next day comes rolling by. This had made me hate how time is passing me by so quickly.

17,"Is this BF, or more sinister?","At three months into a relationship, I woke up and forgot my partner's name for 10 terrifying seconds.

After knowing one of my best friends for 8 years, I forgot her name for 10 terrifying seconds when introducing her.

When someone said ""wow, I had a lot of fun last night!"" it took me a very horrible 10-20 seconds to remember what I did, where I went, what day it was, or even that I saw them at all. I remembered eventually ""oh yeah, we were at a party"" but I don't drink and was sober. How did I not remember going out at all? 

When I watch movies, plot twists like ""it was X the whole time!"" don't phase me sometimes.... because I don't recognize the character. I know they must have been in the movie at previous points since it seems like everyone knows who they are... but I do not recognize their face. And I do not retain names of anyone in any story. 

Sometimes I will see comments I made on social media and have no memory of writing them. 

I have ADHD, OCD, anxiety and depression. These short but severe lapses in memory have made thighs very scary sometimes.

22,Brain fog and language comprehension/processing,"I’ve had my brain fog for almost 4 years.  The symptom that bothers me most of all is the sudden difficulties in language that I had never experienced in my life prior to getting brain fog.  I have no problems with word recall, or speech (my speech and writing are completely unaffected and remain fluent).  However, processing information has become very difficult.  Sometimes, when I read a simple sentence or hear a simple phrase, I have to mentally map out the meaning of each word and how they connect and sometimes I’ll struggle to even connect them.  Sometimes I’ll be able to read a book or webpage or watch a long form informational YouTube video just fine, others times not so much.  I remember, about a year ago I believe, I came across a term online called “aphasia” which is basically related to neurodegenerative diseases and brain damage.  I became so paranoid that I might have some rare, early onset form of it and, it being a permanent and unremediable condition, these thoughts drove me to the depths of despair.  Consequently, I decided to have an MRI done and undergo and neuropsychological evaluation.  The MRI came back normal and I apparently performed above average on the neuropsychological evaluation.  I still had doubts and feared that I had some form of brain damage or neurodegenerative disease.  I’ve actually somehow been able to finish books like this, but it’s still really a hassle.  Too an outside observer, it would seem like absolutely nothing is wrong because I perform daily tasks and give proper responses to questions and comments directed at me without hesitation.  Strangely enough, I’m currently doing well in a foreign language class where I’m learning a new language and my math skills are unaffected.  I just really want to know if I have brain damage.  Part of me wants to visit a neurologist again and have some more tests done to completely rule out the possibility or brain damage and neurodegenerative disease.",qfvjwi,20,1.0,6,2021-10-26 01:32:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/qfvjwi/brain_fog_and_language_comprehensionprocessing/,False,False,2021,10

2,Fish oil has helped me tremendously,"Hi everyone,

I’m writing this on my phone and English is not my native language but I really wanted to share this information with this sub so excuse me if it’s a bit all over the place.

I have been struggling with brain fog for about 4 years. The main symptoms were inability to think critically, difficulty remembering words and putting sentences together in a conversation etc. Focusing on anything was also a struggle. I started avoiding social situations because I couldn’t hold a conversation at all and I just knew that I always came across as very stupid. After every social event (even casual hanging out with close friends) I would feel terrible about it, I knew that I was not dumb at all but I couldn’t help it. I think having brain fog made me actually quite depressed and made me have very low self esteem.

So like everyone else, I had been looking for the cause or a solution but I couldn’t find anything. I exercise three times a week at least, I eat well and my blood test came back perfect. I’ve tried literally every supplement that’s been mentioned here or other websites. The only things that kinda helped were modafinil/armodafinil. But obviously it was just masking the problem and I wasn’t gonna take it regularly.

So a bit over a month ago I was listening to a podcast by Andrew Huberman, he’s a very knowledgeable neuroscientist and I recommend everyone to check him out. I was listening to a podcast about depression and he mentioned that Omega 3 has been shown to help a lot for people with depression. (I wouldn’t say I was depressed but having brain fog was definitely affecting my mental state) Now I have taken fish oil multiple times before but I never really noticed anything and stopped. However, Huberman said in his podcast that the point from where it’s effective is 1g of EPA. Now this is more than daily recommended dose on most fish oil supplement labels. I bought an extra strength fish oil supplement and I still need to take two pills (600mg x 2) to reach that threshold. Also it is very important to take it with a big meal so it can stick to other fats, otherwise if you take it on an empty stomach or a low fat meal then it might not work.

Anyways, I started noticing effects after just 3 days or so and now it’s been long enough to know that it’s not just the honey moon phase as it happens with other supplements. I was at a Halloween party last weekend and people said I looked great and seemed different in a good way. And that’s true, I was very social and my head just felt clear. I was drinking alcohol which before would have made my brain fog worse but this time I just had a lot of fun. Also I just finished my exam week and for the first time ever I was able to study 8hrs a day for a week without getting frustrated about it and remained focused and actually enjoyed it.

I definitely recommend it to everyone who has a similar brain fog to what I had. Just make sure to take at least 1g EPA and together with a big meal.

4,"Brain Fog and ""Mind-Blanking"" as a Trauma Response","So after a lot of self-reflection, I realized that a lot of my brain fog likely stems from my default ""freeze"" response to traumatic experiences and general difficulties in life.  I often responded to trauma by tuning everything out and sort of entering a dream state (much like we experience with brain fog).  I also made a lot of mistakes in my life due to my sheltered upbringing and lack of socialization, which made me doubt myself a lot, and I think this doubt is what prevents me from believing I can learn to do better.  I remember all those mistakes and my brain freezes to protect myself from the shame, which leads to more brain fog.

Let me know if this resonates with any of you.  I think if I learn to manage my thoughts better through therapy, meditation, and journaling, it will help to get me out of this fog.  Despite my problems, I was a pretty smart kid up until I started university, so I'm hoping I'll be able to bounce back from this as I gain confidence in myself.  I just have to keep learning and trying new things.",qpn8zd,60,0.99,12,2021-11-08 21:08:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/qpn8zd/brain_fog_and_mindblanking_as_a_trauma_response/,False,False,2021,11
5,Fog finally lifting!,"For two years I've been battling brain fog. Developed quite an addiction to caffeine thinking it would help but it always made me worse off. Tried many supplements and vitamins and absolutely nothing worked. I developed some mild insomnia as a teen that's persisted up until now. I remembered reading something about zinc helping you sleep better through the night, but at the time I figured nothing else worked so why even bother? A couple weeks ago I decided to give it a shot and its been legitimately life changing. While there is still a bit of fog left through the day, it is tremendously better than where I was. So not only am I sleeping a bit better, my fog seems to have almost vanished as well! Moral of the story, never stop your search for clarity.

12,There’s something seriously wrong with me.,"Hello good people of Reddit. I’ve stumbled across this subreddit recently and many things just clicked. I’m trying to figure out what exactly is wrong with me and I kinda think that somebody could help with that. If not, I take this post as my personal online diary :)

So to start with, something about me. I am male; 20 years old. 
Sport type, competitive cyclist on quite high national level. Fitness diet, low fat intake (<30g per day); 
Gym enjoyer (3-5 per week); 
Night shifts at Grocery Store as part time job; Currently first year on college; 
living with GF; 

I used to be that “gifted kid” with huge potential at Elementary School; Read a lot, close to zero nowadays; Slow decline of sharpness during secondary school and complete dumbass at the end (had a huge problem with learning for not-so-hard graduation exams). 

So, what are other symptoms that I have? (From life crippling to “manageable”)

* Brain Fog (severe, I can’t focus, I can’t remember recent things, my GF has noticed, my parents have noticed, my friends have noticed)

* “Out of body feeling” - I can work fine, but especially at sport or gym, I feel like NPC character living in my head; not in control. Same with emotions. I can be in restaurant with my friends or girlfriend and I feel like an actor, who plays my character not myself. Emotions numbness is there too.
* Erectile dysfunction & Complete loss of Sex Drive - well this is new. Since February 2021 just after overcome of Covid (could it be the reason?) I’ve completely lost my sex drive to the point where I have sex just once since that and I was on Viagra. At the age of 20. Awesome.

* Anxiety and Low Self-Confidence - because the previous one, I started to notice huge decline in my confidence as well as increase in my anxiety (both my father and grandfather suffers from anxiety disorder and we have Alzheimer’s disease in our family); I have a huge fear that I could lost my GF because of this.

* I feel tired. ALL THE TIME. I could sleep 12 hours. I could sleep 2 hours, there isn’t any difference. I had been scared that since I start my night shifts, brain fog gets worse but it didn’t. Guess I’ve hit the dead bottom before.

* Overthinking - this is the last “big” point I’ve think of. I overthink everything. It’s probably part of anxiety-stress-low confidence problem but I thought it’s worth mentioning.

* I am notorious Scroller - like what the heck? I procrastinate as hell and I can spend hours of scrolling my social sites. I wouldn’t label it as a symptom, however, many people from this sub has it.

What I’ve tried to do:

* Diet Change - I try more fat, no caffeine, no meat, more meat; nothing changed.

* CT and MRI Scans - my mother works as a radiologist so she “had me tested”. No problem with my head, well, no problem that can be scanned.

* Psychologist Checkup - Everybody has told me “hey, you have depression” and I indeed have some of the symptoms of ADHD and Chronic depression, however, three of my doctors refused to prescribe me Wellbutrin/Bupropion and gave me Zoloft and Benzodiazepines, which I just won’t use.

* Urology Checkup - I’ve got into this manly loop hole of “Maybe you have Brain Fog because you didn’t sleep with your gf. Well, they didn’t find a thing and prescribed me Viagra.

* Blood tests - Then I thought it’s low testosterone. Paradoxically I have higher than average Full Testosterone. They didn’t check Free Testosterone tho.

* Nootropics - I tried whole package: Tribulus, Maca, Zinc, Magnesium, Quercetin, Citruline Malate, A-Z vitamins and all of this stuff. Apart from no muscle cramps (thanks magnesium), no change.

What I plan to do:

* Thyroid Checkup - I have booked an appointment, I had a friend with similar symptoms.

* Sleep Apnea Checkup - I read in another sub that this could be problem.

* Another Psychiatrist Checkup - you know, they might find something else.

* Allergologist Checkup - I’ve read on this sub a successful story of treating brain fog with medication for allergy and getting rid of molds in his apartment.

* Try to have normal sleep schedule - this could contribute to brain fog, however, I don’t think it’s the main problem. I have 6 hours of sleep a day, sometimes more, sometimes less.

* One last change of Diet - Sometimes I have almost Lactose Intolerance symptoms, but sometimes I could digest dairy products without any problems. Weird.

Well, what do you think about it? I would appreciate any feedback, tips, another subs where I could post this, anything. I would be extremely glad for anything that could even slightly help me.

It’s really limiting for me, I’d like to live normal life that I barely remember at this moment…

13,My most annoying symptoms and consequences -Anyone else?,"-I am literally unable to take in what is said to me or take in what I read. I don't know what this is, but speech is just noise with no meaning, and text is just a string of words with no meaning. 

Due to that I am unable to understand anything, and I am unable to summarize or highlight the important points of a video/speech or text.

-It is very hard to memorize things by heart, my short term memory (let's say if I have to recall what I ate yesterday for lunch, I have already forgotten) sucks, my long term memory (such as remembering memories) sucks that even my mom remembers more of my life than I do. I have to search the definitions of words I used to know but lost the meaning of, it's so strange.

This makes it harder to present something I am supposed to memorize and makes it harder to learn

-I take a lot of time to form a coherent sentence, let alone if I have to plagiarize a sentence (communicating the same meaning of a sentence using different words). I suspect this is because my mind is blank so there is no thought put into what I write, it's just spontaneous not off my head.

This makes it so much harder to write/communicate 


-Let's say I am asked a simple question like ""how was your childhood"", my mind is just blank which makes me not being able to answer.

This may give off the false sentiment that I am cold when I am just at a loss of words/mind is just blank

-Not sure if this is brainfog related, but I am extremely distracted by noise if I am working on something, and also extremely irritated by noise

This will make it even harder to be productive (my brainfog still exists in total quiet though), the mere ""tic tock"" sound of a clock is annoying me.

-Again not sure if brainfog related, but it seems like the thing in my brain that signals that I am full from food is gone, I just don't know when to stop eating anymore so I just eat till I'm stuffed

This leads to weight gain 


Those are the symptoms which are bothering me the most, is anyone experiencing the same thing? At least I won't feel all alone in this world with those symptoms.

Surprisingly, when I sleep, I have dreams, so I don't even know why I would have thoughts in my sleep but not when I'm awake (unless thoughts aren't what dreams are made of)

17,"Brain fog suddenly went away, I don't what changed, but I am trying to figure out how to keep brain fog away, what changes can I make? Feels life changing, and desperate to find ways to avoid brain fog again.","long story short, always had issues with attention. Thought a lot of my problems were ADHD based. When I was able to apply myself, I did really well. Graduated valedictorian in college and high school. I started med school in 2019 (had several emotional traumatic experiences around then and was pretty burned out).. major brain fog started happening. ""acquired dyslexia"" and ""chronic fatigue"" is how I'd describe it.. I would read things in a book or on screen and feel confused and unable to tell you what I just read.  Eventually I was put on meds for sleep apnea and depression/anxiety. Brain fog has limited my performance and capability so much in medical school, been taking forever to take my board exam and procrastinating... I'm honestly not sure what happened in the past week, but all of a sudden all the topics I needed to learn in medical school the last 2 years are just coming to me and sticking like they used to in college. I've been putting off my board exam dates and procrastinating since April, but I finally settled on a December test date a few weeks back. Still have been in a slow slump to study but started picking things up. 

Some things I 'm being treated for since Dec 2019: anxiety, seasonal affective, sleep apnea, ADHD, chronic inflammation (IBS and joint pains + sinusitis). 

I seriously cannot put into words how appreciative and grateful I feel to have a ""functional"" brain again. I used to be callous and take things for granted, and since life/academic performance were something I put a lot of value on, the last few years have made me feel so shitty about myself when I couldn't do ""simple"" things and saw classmates and old school mates/friends do things I would never had issues with before. I seriously feel like a new person again, and want to do anything I can to not fall back into brain fog again. Inability to think clearly and get otherwise ""normal"" stuff done has been extremely depressing and really affecting social and academic performance the last 2 years. I feel like I just hit a reset button and I want to try to put myself in the best position to keep going forward. Any ideas what changes I can make to try to limit brain fog from happening again in the future?

Update 1) 11/17:
- Really appreciate everyone chiming in and their support. Will keep everyone updated and hope to help out on this sub community. If anyone needs to chat please feel free to PM. 
- took suggestions from several people who said to just let brain fog pass and not overthink it today. it seemed to make a difference Replied to someone in the comments, but adding it here in case anyone else wants to try. It might sound ridiculous at first to some, but it actually might not be a bad idea to “let it pass”. Before today I would normally get frustrated and fight that feeling…

Update 2) how the day after discussing some
Folks on here went: 
“
* hope to finish off boards on a good note, and try to hit a big reset button on life and get some stuff together if To stay in this better mindset and state before hospital rotations this spring. 

* update for anyone who suggested letting brain fog pass without fighting it : I was studying today, and around 1 PM.. started feeling the fatigue and “dyslexic” feelings again. Was watching videos on leukemias and was going well all morning and then all of a sudden it felt like someone flipped the off switch. Normally I would kind of panic and get frustrated.. took you and others’ advice and tried not to “overthink” it. Just let myself procrastinate/cool off by grabbing something to eat and sitting down without a screen in front of me. Took a walk around my old campus, rehydrated, and started up again about 2 hours later, was able to work through a whole block of practice questions with no major fog symptoms like I used to have.

^obviously everyone’s situation might be different, but if one is on proper med dosages, nutrients, sleep etc and nothing seems to work, it’s worth trying to consciously let it pass to see if you can recover.

20,I am slowly losing my ability to communicate,"The English, my only language, is falling out of my head. I only understand basic lexicon and have had a difficult time keeping up with my peers without using a dictionary. I never have had to do this prior to my brain fog. I am scared and feel so incredibly doltish. I never abused any substances before and yet I suffer a fate worse than death itself, a perpetual state of nothing. Humans are those who exist in a state of being. Being happy. Being sad. Being excited. Being aware. Being motivated. We are not anything. Simply wanderers who wait until the day they meet their inevitable end, yet still afraid for the day it does come. At the very least, this community is comforting to know there are others with kindred ordeals.

28,Has anyone had brain fog since birth?,"**My symptoms (since birth or very close to birth):**

\- Whenever I talk, I'm completely ""blind"" on what I'm going to talk next. It's like if my thought is a vision, my field of vision is super narrow, and it takes a lot of time to think of the next thing I'm going to say. This makes prolonged speeches impossible, because I freeze a couple of seconds just to think about what I'm going to talk next. I'm also very awkward with my choice of words because I constantly have to search for an appropriate vocabulary but my brain doesn't allow me to. I'm also very uncreative in terms of the things I say, and people say I'm super boring when I talk. I talk very little, sometimes I avoid talking completely in front of people because my mind is SUPER blank. Like void blank. I have zero freaking idea how people can talk quickly and eloquently and have clever gags and complicated figures of speech in their disposal. My brain doesn't naturally work like that. Due to this, its super hard to socialize. I cannot share my life experience/interests/hobbies fluently or expressing my ideas without pausing awkwardly. They usually realize I'm weird right from the start of meeting with me because I'm too mute and seem like an awkward guy to talk to. For the record, I have zero friends I talk to these days. People who were stuck with me for 3 years of high school completely gave up on me (they were good people). I rely on my family for little amount of socialization. Even my relatives think I'm weird and avoid me subtly.

\- The above applies to writing too. Writing this post takes a whole lot of time for me to collect my thoughts. Usually when I write posts to social media, I take the draft down because they're way too verbose, too incoherent, cringey, or just doesn't convey my point of view clearly. I'm uncreative with my use of vocabulary and figures of speech. I also can't make up narratives fluently like other people.

\- I have slow processing speed. When friends or relatives have conversation in normal speed, I can only follow them with big mental effort. Whenever I hear a lecture, watch Youtube video, or watch a film, its like my brain turns off and intermittently stop processing some chunks of what people say and I have to either rewind or pause to think what was said earlier, but by that time the speech has already gone further. I also might have some kind of auditory processing disorder, because sometimes I cannot hear fully hear what someone says when other people immediately knows what they're saying.

\- When I read, sometimes I have to read the same sentence multiple times. Also, I sometimes don't get what a complex sentence is telling me.

\- When I play instruments, I make constant mistakes even on repetitive chord progressions. I cannot perfectly memorize melody without making mistakes. I'm totally confused how people can move to the next part of the song without screwing up their playing. This also happens to other skills that require real time performance. The only thing I'm really good at (not subpar performance compared to other people) is scoring well in tests. Usually I'm allotted enough time to score higher than other people. But i think if i weren't to have this problem, I would've scored even higher in tests because I'm also careless and anxious during tests.

\- Despite having high IQ (tested 156 once and 154 another), I seem to have little capacity to store and inquire general knowledge. I'm good at logical stuff (problems that require pure logic and little prior knowledge, like math, programming, physics). But learning and processing new stuff seems too overwhelming and exhausting to me. People seem to know a lot about their favorite movies, recent events and development in the world, while I'm severely blind of a great deal of information. My interests are in ""simple"" and easily understandable things such as watching Power Rangers for years, reading reddit, and watching youtube. I do change my interests regularly but they all fall in the category of being too ""simple"". If a concept is too complex for a child to understand, I can still comprehend it but I will be too lazy to do so because it's mentally exhausting or it will take more time for me to do so because of my slow processing speed.

\- I have poor short term memory. I forget what the exact thing my mother told me to do because my space of memory is too limited (also because she talks too fast and i'm too slow to process her instructions). I have to reread previous sentences in a book because I forgot what they said. I forgot what I ate in the morning. I don't know if my long term memory is affected, but I can clearly remember some details of events in childhood. When my friends already forgot what last year's high school course was about, I can recall most of the academic concepts taught years ago. So sometimes I think my long term memory is better than others, but not my short term memory.

My mom's testimony kind of supports the idea that my ""brain fog"" has always persisted since birth or very close to birth. One time I asked her if I've always been like this, and she said, yes, I've been always seemed to be a kid who is withdrawn, ""has"" his own world, talking very little to other people even when asked to, slow, and ""robotic"".

This sounds like a case of ADHD or autism, maybe a moderate to severe one. But I'm having a hard time getting prescribed ADHD medications in my third world country. I've done MRI and EEG, both came back normal. I want to get tested for nutritional deficiencies too, but I don't have other symptoms beside my cognitive impairments and my mom doesn't want me to spend money getting checked up on all sorts of things. She supplies me B12 and D3 supplements anyway. I took things like turmeric with black pepper, ginger, fruits like strawberry and banana, and I don't feel they gave any improvement. I even tried ibuprofen once (to clear inflammation or something) and don't feel anything. I haven't tried changing my diet though. I know my attempts are too random, I've only been lurking in this subreddit for 1 month. I'll try more later.

Sorry for the long and incoherent rant. IDK how to exactly put it. I feel super dumb right now plz bear with me.

1,Arguably one of the Biggest Revelation/Realization in my Life (NO MORE BRAINFOG),"Hi all,

To give you a very brief background about myself, I am a mid-20 aged male undergraduate college student who has for the past years (for however long it has been) been struggling severely with brain fog or with some debilitating cognitive impairment that has caused various symptoms ranging from memory loss to depression and to name a few more, lack of motivation, inability to quickly make decisions for even the most trivial things, ruminations about the past, daydreaming and the WORST of ALL, getting so easily fatigued or tired - getting tired even from just staying still or using brain energy just a tiny bit. And no I am not the type of personality to get easily depressed. I would like to consider myself relatively an ambitious, motivated, optimistic, confident and positive person, meaning that I don't get stressed easily or expect to experience brain fog for any psychological reasons if that makes any sense.

Experiencing mental fatigueness (ranging from very *suddenly* losing motivation to do something to wanting to sleep after having slept for more than 8 hours or even after using your brain energy for just a tiny bit (i.e. solving one difficult math problem)). This is the one symptom that I could not try to find the origin of, for months and years. I tried all sorts of things to figure out the potential causes: took multiple MRi scans of my brain at even different hospitals at different times, even did the cartoid ultrasound tests (basically checks whether blood is flowing healthily to your brain by examining the arteries in your neck), changed my diet by removing all the red meat or anything that basically could contribute to high blood pressure or cholesterol levels, my sleeping patterns, and even doing heavy excessive and intense exercises (mainly weightlifting, which frankly does help and obviously because it does release those hormones that give you more energy and help you feel focused and aware), doing certain stretches that would straighten my spine (WHICH ULTIMATELY DOES MATTER). I may not be listing everything that I have did to find and understand the cause of my brainfog, but I have tried everything. And today (still getting chills writing up this post), at last, and fortuitously, I have discovered the exact reason and main cause for the brain fog: poor posture. Here is the thing, it's not a simple matter of having a straightened spine. Your spine must be full straightened, your hip and butt extended all the way to the back and YOUR HEAD MUST NOT FALL FORWARD. This is called the anterior head carriage, and some of you may have heard of it before, but essentially, the more your head falls forward, the heavier your head will ""feel"", the more slouched your body will become --> less oxygen flowing to your brain and much more fatigue, stress and all the bad things you are experiencing due to brainfog.

Now, I am writing this post up because I cannot believe that the problem lied in poor posture, and I am sure there were times where I was sitting in good posture and didn't experience brainfog, but would have never thought or imagined that posture was the differentiating factor. How do I know that posture was main cause of the brainfog? It was simple. For me, brainfog is difficulty reading texts (texts that are easy to read) quickly and staying focused, not drifting away to other thoughts, not being able to recall things easily and quickly, instant shift into bad or even sometimes depressed mood, suddenly ruminating about something (this is more because it's a habit and not so much due to the brain-fog) and etc. So I tried reading and spending the day in the most slouched form and worst posture I could, and I was experiencing all the aforementioned symptoms. When I changed the posture, that means fully straightening my back (this was the most important factor) and not leaning my head forward at all, I experienced almost none of these symptoms. If this matters at all or means anything, I tried this multiple times (all in the span of one day) and everytime, it made that difference. I will continue to live my life with a good posture and see if it continues to make a difference.

The purpose of this post is to share another potential cause that like myself, many of you or others may have never thought of and are suffering from brainfog. Perhaps you already have and tried to change the posture, perhaps not. But I did/still am doing research on the relationship between posture and brainfog, and there is a definitive association, if not a strong correlation between the two, and I wanted to share this with anyone experiencing a brainfog but have never considered posture the cause for it. Obviously, don' take my story or advice into full consideration if this would cause any medical issues for you. All of this still feels surreal to me, the fact that posture, out of everything else it could be, that it was posture that was significantly impacting my neurological function. If anyone else has experienced something similar, please feel free to comment, and I would love to hear your experiences as well.

Thank you and stay strong.

EDIT: If any of you were curious, this is under the assumption that I am on a very healthy diet (get most of the macronutrient intake from white rice and seafood (mostly salmon, mackerel, tuna and etc), try to avoid any kind of red meat as much as I can and I can testify that reducing red meat consumption does make a difference in giving you more energy throughout the day and this is because red meat consumption leads to a build-up of plaques in your arteries, which are from my understanding lumps of solid fats or lipids that reduce blood flow which means oxygen, nutrients and all the essential things that the body needs are not being transported smoothly or enough of it is reaching its destination), avoid sugar, substitute all your unhealthy snacks with fruits and with fruits that have high fiber, potassium and etc, make sure that every meal includes some sort of greens and vegetables, drink a ton of water), get at least six hours of sleep, exercise intensely at least five times a week for an hour and half (only do cardio once or twice a week, at max twice a week).

EDIT 2: I am learning more about all the different causes of my brainfog, but I have been also slowly realizing that breathing is just as important as maintaining a good posture, and more specifically, inhaling with your nose and exhaling with your mouth. The neurons in our brains need that supply of oxygen to function, so the more oxygen we are breathing in, I think the better it is for our brain.

6,"How I got rid of brain fog (no medication, no ad here)","Reddit
I am new here. I read the rules of this sub so hopefully I am not breaking any. I am also not a doctor or medically trained professional, so I am not giving any medical advice, which should be provided by your own doc. What I list below is my OWN experience that I hope it will help ya’ll. 
Background
I started noticing brain fog about 15 years ago and then realized that I lived with it for a long long time.
What I tried (and didn’t work): I talked to my doc about it. He referred me to a few specialists. I did a full neurological assessment with a neurologist, I did an electroencephalogram (EEG) session to confirm brainwave stuff is working as expected and confirm there are no micro seizures. I did a brain MRI. There were no red flags. Where WTF is going on?

What Worked for Me:

The offenders: 
In my case, the top offenders that trigger extreme brain fog are gluten, added sugar, and excessive consumption of animal products. Consuming too much coffee will impair my speech too. 

What Worked for Me: 

I accidentally stumbled on a few things - and yes a documentary too :) - online and figure out that all my problems were related to diet. Well mostly diet and some psychological stuff as well.

I got rid of brain fog and felt in control in the first time in a long time thanks to the following changes. I tied them in different orders, combinations and different levels of commitment. But what really worked and was able to see a huge improvement within weeks is when I was strict and committed.

1. Eliminate gluten COMPLETELY. I did celiac tests and turned out negative. But not eating gluten had made the biggest positive effect on my brain. No bread, no cookies, no pasta, no croissants. Nada. Except the gluten free version, which by the way taste like crap. But the gains overweigh the losses. 

2. Eliminate added sugars COMPLETELY. No added sure anywhere. Not in my bread, not in my natural juices, not in any food I eat. After I got comfortable with my new diet, I got a bit relaxed. So if gluten free stuff has a little sure, I don’t eat too much of it. Definitely no soda, no candy, no bars (Kit Kat, etc.)

3. Completely eliminate animal products: no meat, no butter, no milk, no cheese, etc. (see What the Health documentary to know why)

4. I quit coffee completely for a few months. I kept drinking green tea, which has caffeine, but it didn’t seem to have any negative impact. In fact I think green tea helps with inflammation. 

I realized that the first 3 types of products I listed above trigger inflammation in the body - and the brain and getting rid of them got rid of my brain fog completely. 
I reintroduced coffee later on, but very limited amounts. I used to drink 3 - 4 double shots daily but now I limit my intake to only one double shot daily. I drink a ton of green tea daily. 

At the same time, I needed to train my brain to focus. Because the poor thing got used to the clouds for a long time. I used the pomodoro technique to focus for 20 minutes at a time and then increased it gradually.

7,"Do you ever get frustrated when you have things under control for a bit, then suddenly have a backslide for awhile?","So as best as myself and my doctor can determine, my brain fog comes from worsening sleep apnea, and the inflammation is worsened by dairy products.

But the past 3-4 days have been markedly worse for seemingly no reason. Just a rough patch. 

I'm not as much looking for advice, as I am just venting a bit. Nobody in my life really understands what I am going through, and it's just so hard to deal with.

8,Chronic brain fog from antibiotics,"Hello.  I'm a 34 year old male dealing with significant and chronic brain fog for 8+ years.  My brain fog started very abruptly one morning while I was a few days into a course of antibiotics.  This is my story..

Sorry for the length.

**Description of my brain fog:**

It's a very noticeable and obvious feeling/sensation within my consciousness and brain.  It can be as obvious as the difference between being sober and being very buzzed/drunk.  If I took someone who had never experienced it and all of a sudden I just gave them my brain fog they would immediately be like ""wtf is happening to me what is wrong with my brain"".  Sometimes the fog affects my sense of higher-level feelings/mood and it just blocks or mutes feelings of joy/happiness/sadness, etc , sometimes it affects cognition and my brain's ability to just ""think"", sometimes it's just sort of there in the background and doesn't affect feelings or cognition and isn't really disruptive (more like a haze than a fog).  Sometimes (rarely) it's completely gone and my brain is clear and feels normal.

* It's transient and the intensity/severity of it changes throughout the day gradually over many minutes or hours.
* It's dynamic.  It manifests in subtle and different ways and feels different during different times/days but there's always just a general fog type of feeling with each variation.
   * a sort of buzzed/drunk feeling.  it's kind of like the feeling of being intoxicated but without the poor judgement, physical effects or behavioral changes of being intoxicated (pretty common)
   * a scratchiness/fuzzy feeling deep in my brain (a bit of a nails on the chalkboard type of sensation) (pretty common)
   * a brain sludge in which my brain itself just feels very slow and any cognitive task is extremely difficult or impossible (rare)
   * a stuffiness in my head/brain (somewhat common)
   * a haze that's just sort of there but not really causing any cognitive disruption (somewhat common)
   * agitated/impatient/short tempered (rare)
   * a dark/depression sort of fog (this is very rare but I'm convinced it's still ""fog"" related because it is still very brief and transient and still just feels like a fog, as opposed to just feeling ""depressed"" on it's own)
   * fog with severe anxiety - it just feels like I've been injected with anxiety because of it's transient nature and that it occurs for no tangible reason.  It's very very rare and I've only experienced it a handful of times and it always seems to be directly related to a new medication or supplement that I had recently tried.  There's also usually a period of excellent improvement either before or afterwards.  Severe, unexplained, out-of-the-blue anxiety is also how all of my brain fog first manifested during that course of antibiotics that triggered it
* I do sometimes have periods during the day or entire days (very very rare) with very little to zero brain fog and during these times my brain feels completely normal, like my old self.  It feels amazing.
* It usually comes in cycles of days or weeks where it can be mostly manageable and not disruptive and then the next week it can be unmanageable and significantly disruptive to my life
* It's frequently worse in the evening and does frequently improve later in the evening before bed.
* Usually it seems to be completely gone overnight while sleeping but it does sometimes persist through the night and I can tell it's there while dreaming or if I wake up during the night.
* Frequently, I can wake up in the morning and feel pretty clear laying in bed and then almost immediately after getting out of bed it will start to develop.
* Sometimes it will significantly improve or clear shortly after a bowel movement, other times bowel movements don't seem to impact it.
* Strenuous exercise can briefly reduce or even eliminate it
* Being sick seems to improve/change my symptoms.  There's been several times I've had a bad cold or just been sick and the fog seems to improve significantly during the period I'm sick
* Dealing with major stressful life events (like a breakup) seems to improve/change my symptoms for days
* This one is super weird.. but I've noticed over the years that wearing glasses makes my brain fog worse.  (I wear contacts most of the time).  I always wondered why the fog seemed to get stronger/change when I would drive and just assumed coincidence, until one day on a long trip I realized that wearing sunglasses caused my brain fog to temporarily change/worsen. If I have even a small amount of brain fog that I can mostly ignore, it seems to get stronger when I wear glasses and then fade when I take them off.  it's so dang weird.
* I really have no other chronic symptoms that accompany the brain fog.  No digestive/GI issues like bloating, constipation, diarrhea, etc.  I have normal bowel movements every 1-2 days on average.  I have good energy, I sleep well, I am able to do prolonged periods of strenuous exercise, etc.

Basically, it's very complex, complicated, unpredictable and dynamic.  But it always just feels like a fog that rolls in and out.  My normal/clear brain is in there somewhere it's just covered in fog most of the time.

**Health background:**

Before my brain fog started, I had zero health issues whatsoever.  I would get an occasional cold or flu once every couple of years and that was all.  A few months prior to the brain fog, I was diagnosed with mononucleosis.  I took 1 (possibly 2) courses of antibiotics at the start of getting sick with mono (before I was tested for mono) and after a couple of weeks of mono I took a round of steroids due to severe tonsil swelling from the mono.  The worst part of the mono was the sore throat towards the end but otherwise it mostly just felt like a bad cold/flu for a few weeks and then I fully recovered.

A couple of months after I recovered from mono I started to develop some gut issues.  I had a brief 1-2 day stomach bug during which I couldn't eat much without throwing it up but it resolved on it's own.  Apart from the stomach bug I started having some very mild nausea at times throughout the day and this came and went over a period of days or possibly weeks.  It was mild and more of a nuisance than anything.  I can't recall whether the stomach bug or the nausea came first.

Within a couple weeks or so of my new minor gut issues, I noticed a swollen gland in my mouth (I believe it was a salivary gland).  Because I was already hyper sensitive to my health at this point, I went to the doctor to have it checked out.  The doctor prescribed antibiotics and it was a few days into this round of antibiotics that my brain fog started abruptly one morning.

I strongly believe that the multiple rounds of antibiotics over the period of a few months significantly altered my gut microbiome and directly led to my brain fog.  I think my suppressed immune system from the recent steroids and from fighting off mononucleosis also contributed.  The rather unfortunate part of all of this is that none of the rounds of antibiotics I took were even necessary or warranted.  I wish I would have known then what I know now about antibiotics.

I've struggled ever since to keep my symptoms manageable via diet and herbal supplements.  At times it's manageable and not super disruptive but more often than not its largely unmanageable and very disruptive.  It has and continues to significantly affect my quality of life and I consider it a very serious chronic disease.  I've been to many doctors including GI docs and functional medicine doctors.  I have yet to see a neurologist (stupid, I know) but I am pretty convinced a neurologist isn't going to be any help to me either.. but I do still plan to see one soon because I've got nothing to lose (other than more money).

**A very long random list of some of the things I've tried or things I continually do to try and ""manage"" my symptoms:**

* Nystatin:  Antifungal for suspected candida overgrowth.  This one is some really compelling evidence to support my confidence that all of my issues are gut related and therefore directly caused by antibiotics.  Within the first few months of my issues starting I tried nystatin (the Dr. figured it was relatively harmless to try even though he was obviously skeptical) and for the first time since my issues began, I had complete clearing of my brain fog.  I was amazed and thought I had cured myself.  BUT either later that day or perhaps the following day I was hit with crippling anxiety which lasted at least most of the day or maybe even two or three days.  Shortly afterwards my brain fog returned.  I was scared off of nystatin and didn't try it again until many months or maybe even years later and when I did try it I started with very small dosages and slowly worked my way up.  I was able to get to full dosage again but did not get the improvement I first got, although it did seem to still affect my symptoms but I wasn't able to tell if it led to improvements in the end or not.  I don't know why it initially cleared my fog only for crippling anxiety to take it's place.  Perhaps it was die off, perhaps I DID initially have a candida issue and it cleared it only for some other pathogenic bacteria to take over.. I don't know.
* fluconazole:  antifungal for suspected candida overgrowth.  I tried this after trying nystatin.  I took 1 dose in the morning.  I don't recall if I noticed any improvement during that day but I do recall the terror-inducing new symptom that started that evening.  Out of nowhere while washing dishes I felt a weird sensation in my chest and felt my pulse and noticed my heart was randomly skipping beats.  I immediately panicked, thought I was going to drop dead any second and decided the smartest thing I could do would be to get in my car and drive over to the heart hospital that was literally in my backyard.  (walking would have been safer but I figured if my heart stopped while driving I'd at least have a better chance of being found sooner).  I was diagnosed with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and sent home after some observation.  And a follow up with a cardiologist and echocardiogram showed no issues. Turns out fluconazole can cause heart rhythm issues.  I never took it again.  BUT the curious thing is that I believe my brain fog was significantly improved for a day or two after that single dose. Also, I continued to have PVCs in the months and years after that single dose (and STILL rarely have bouts of them) so there's no way they are completely related to the drug.  And it seems that I tend to get the PVCs during periods when my brain fog is significantly improved.  I haven't dropped dead from them yet so they mostly don't cause me any worry anymore but it's a fun little symptom to deal with when I've made progress on my brain fog.  But I do firmly believe they, too, are gut related.
* Breathalyzer: because of suspected autobrewery syndrome.  But it always reads 0.0
* Blood sugar monitoring: never abnormal
* Full blood work from doctors: normal.  although one very curious abnormality one time was early on during severe symptoms I went to the hospital and blood work showed that my liver enzymes were quite elevated which was abnormal for me (I noticed it on my own afterwards - the hospital docs didn't notice or care much of it).  they were normal again the next time I had blood work done and have remained normal since.  But it's one of the few pieces of ""medical"" evidence that tells me something was up when I was experiencing severe symptoms.  My liver was dealing with a toxin overload.
* Brain MRI early on:  normal
* Tons of different herbal antibacterial/antifungal/gut supplements:  garlic, ginger, peppermint, digestive enzymes, colloidal silver, manuka honey, gut healing stuff, psyllium fiber, prebiotics and others too numerous to remember.  I do firmly believe supplements are what enable me to sometimes ""manage"" my symptoms.  They may also be detrimental sometimes, but it seems worth the risk.
* Probiotics:  I've tried many different kinds of probiotics including things like sauerkraut, kefir, kombucha.  They usually make symptoms worse, at least early on but I can never tell in the end if it leads to overall improvement or worsening.
* Stool tests:  did not do these until the past year or so. no candida detected, no ""pathogenic"" bacteria or other organisms.  Some definite overgrowths/imbalances of ""opportunistic"" bacteria and ""normal"" bacteria.  This is still an area I need to do more research in.
* Food allergies:  Stool and blood tests have shown gluten sensitivity and I've done gluten/wheat free for more than 3 months at a time with no improvement.  Additional food allergy testing revealed a handful of moderate or severe sensitives in a handful of foods (eggs, some nuts, beans) and I've done 3 months of elimination of those with no noticeable improvement.
* Diet:  Very early on I immediately went to a very strict zero-sugar, very low-carb (30-50g/day), only whole-grain diet with little to no processed foods (based on the candida theory that sugar/carbs feed the candida).  I've maintained that diet for the bulk of my 8+ years.  I do believe the abrupt and early elimination of sugar got rid of the anxiety that accompanied the brain fog.  I recall in the very beginning before I changed my diet I experienced bad anxiety for a couple of hours after eating ice cream.  It was probably the next day that I cut sugar out completely and I was just left with the brain fog.  I've experimented with going less than 30g of carbs a day for a few days but that leads to my brain basically completely not functioning (just horrible brain sludge) which ends up being worse than the normal brain fog.  I don't know why this is.  I really don't think it's just keto flu.  It could be die-off, it could be my gut feeding off ketones which produces worse symptoms, I just don't know.  Now I generally maintain probably around 60-80g of carbs a day which is still fairly low carb.  I wasn't eating any fruit for the bulk of the 8+ years because of sugar but I have recently introduced some fruit back into my diet.  I eat a lot of vegetables and just clean protein like chicken, beef, fish and I eat lentils, brown rice, quinoa and oatmeal for the bulk of my carbs.  Corn tortilla chips have been my one chronic processed food weakness over the years.  The vegetable oils aren't good I know but the corn itself probably isn't much of a problem.  I figure I could do a lot worse than corn tortilla chips..
* While doing very low carb for a few days and my brain simply shutting down and refusing to work at all, I tried lite salt as recommended for keto for electrolyte support and went straight in for a large dose (can't remember exactly, either 1/8 or 1/4 tsp in water) and an hour or two later I got severe anxiety which lasted for several hours until I had some diarrhea which basically cleared the anxiety immediately.  The brain fog was significantly improved for several days afterwards but I also felt sick for those few days with full body aches.  This is super curious and strange to me.  I've done lite salt multiple times since (1/8 tsp, not 1/4 tsp as I'm scared of the anxiety again) and it's hard to tell for sure but it seems like it still may affect my symptoms the next day.  I think it causes worsening brain sludge which is then followed by nice improvement before the usual fog returns.  I need to continue experimenting with this.  Why would lite salt affect my symptoms?  Blood tests have showed normal electrolytes.
* Intermittent fasting: eating dinner by 6-7 in the evening and not eating anything until around 12 the following day (so about 16-18 hours with no food).  still not sure if this improves my symptoms or not but I do generally just feel good about it for some reason.  it's probably just a good thing to do at times even in good health.
* Histamine theory:  tried supplementing with DAO with meals for a couple days and no improvement.  Have tried benadryl also (why not) and no improvement
* It appears that it usually isn't until the following day that I experience the impact of supplements that I take.  This sort of leads me to believe perhaps my issues are more concentrated further along in my digestive tract like my colon, as opposed to small intestine where I'd expect to see impacts within maybe 3-6 hours.  But I don't know.
* I've frequently been able to have several pretty good days of improvement after doing more aggressive supplementing and dealing with more aggressive symptoms for many days and then stopping completely.  This sort of leads me to believe in the theory of the die-off reaction and that the worsening of my symptoms is actually an improvement of my issue.  But I've dealt with worsening symptoms for weeks at a time and it becomes too unbearable and I have to stop.  Might just be a situation of a never ending war that isn't worth continually fighting with no breaks.
* I diligently journal (daily, for many years now) all food and supplements that I ingest along with my symptoms to try and identify trends and correlation.  But I've found it to be too complex with too many variables to draw any definitive or valuable conclusions.  But I still journal it because it's become sort of therapeutic in a way and I still remain optimistic that one day something will identify itself and I'll be able to go back and identify strong correlation for a particular supplement or food.
* Because of my very negative experience with nystatin early on, I'm VERY cautious/conservative with every new thing I try and I slowly ramp up dosages.  I also try to limit the number of things I take in the same day to just one or two.  I don't take 300 different things every day.  I rotate things over time and try and stick with things until they seem to no longer help me and then I revisit them later on.  None of what I try is super crazy or risky (as far as I know).  It's all pretty standard supplements you can get via amazon, health food stores or functional medicine providers.
* I plan on trying lactulose in the near future as it is proven to help reduce ammonia producing bacteria in the gut for patients with liver disease.  Maybe ammonia is causing my brain fog.
* I plan on trying rifaximin if lactulose doesn't help me.  I'm very hesitant to try it because it's an antibiotic and could just make my symptoms worse but it could also maybe help me.  At this point it seems worth the risk.

The biggest challenge I deal with is trying to identify what helps and what hurts with the massive number of things I've tried over the years.  Ideally, I would test each and every thing in isolation to try and determine if something was beneficial, neutral, or detrimental to my symptoms.  But in reality, I've just simply found it impossible to do that.  My symptoms are too disruptive for me to just wait days and days while only trying one thing at a time.  I'm usually able to get some temporary/transient relief by mixing and matching various things but the obvious drawback to this is that I can't easily identify what may have helped or hurt.  Also, it definitely appears that things don't always have the same effect each time and the issue is very dynamic and constantly changing.  I've come to the likely conclusion that my issue is just simply extremely complicated and complex with simply too many variables (the gut biome is also extremely complicated, after all) and I've learned to ""manage"" it in the most pragmatic and realistic way that I can. It may just require more art than science.  In the end, it could be that this is actually the most effective way to deal with it or perhaps I'm missing my cure with the way I'm doing things.  But I'm just doing what I can to deal with this debilitating disease and I'm OK with that.

A big change for me in the past year or so has been to finally let go of the pure candida kill kill kill fungus theory that I so heavily latched onto early on.  I'm not going to bash that theory or say I was wrong to latch onto it.  I have credible reason to believe it very well could have been a significant factor early on, and it led to a lot of learning and may have led to significant improvement of my issues in the early days.  But I do think it would have been beneficial to not be so hyper-focused on it for so long.  And it feels better and more promising to open my mind up to other possibilities and to explore other avenues.  But in the end, I believe it's still gut dysbiosis all the way down.

**Why I'm sharing my story:**

* It's therapeutic and helpful for me to write this stuff down and think through it.   In a strange way it helps me separate and compartmentalize the disease from the rest of my life
* I'm curious if anyone else in the world has been through or is going through something similar to me.  My feeling is that my specific brain fog is likely quite rare but I doubt I'm the first one to ever go through it and won't be the last
* Maybe someone in the medical field exploring gut and brain health (gut-brain axis) will be interested in studying me and my symptoms.  While my specific issues may be quite rare, there could be things to learn from it that could greatly benefit research into the very immature field of medicine pertaining to the gut-brain axis
* There might be others out there that can offer suggestions for things to try that may help me or maybe something I've mentioned will help someone else
* I want to be able to follow up to my story in the future to say that I've cured or significantly alleviated my symptoms.  As depressing and difficult as this unknown disease is to live with, I remain optimistic that I will one day have my health and my life back",rrag3o,35,1.0,45,2021-12-29 15:16:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/rrag3o/chronic_brain_fog_from_antibiotics/,False,False,2021,12

I was a mediocre employee everywhere I worked, I couldn’t be bothered to socialize because it took too much energy, etc. Recently I finally got on antidepressants and all of that has subsided a lot (I still daydream a lot, so I’m a bit spacey, but that was always a thing).

10,Does anyone have the same symptoms?,"Hey everyone

It is so hard for me to understand when someone is speaking (its like I hear sound but there is no meaning in my head), reading also (I see words but no meaning behind them), very hard to memorize, and if someone asks me a question I cannot think,  I have no thoughts, my head is empty so I end up trying to answer as much as I can without thinking. Also words I knew the meaning of before are like new to me now, and it is very hard to find the right words to express myself so that I can form a coherent sentence.

I have been taking an antidepressant everyday since the 9th of November and it is not helping with the brain fog.

Just little scattered flashes in my head, with no context of time or place or things I said. In other words, my memory has been completely destroyed.

16,The TLDR neck-brain-fog guy back with an update,"TLDR: after weeks of ups and downs, neck feels best I've felt in long time. 

I tend to write bloatedly, it's more of a self-therapy for me but it would make me happy if anyone find anything helpful.

Looking further back in my life, I probably had some form  of cognitive malfunction since young. I come from a lineage of mental illnesses (ADHD, depression and anxiety are common, couple autisms) so it may also have played a factor. So I don't know what proportion of my brain fog is mental and physical. Right now all I know is that the biggest culprit is my neck, which I recall feeling off as early as high school and progressively worsening throughout my teens and early twenties. While I wasn't conscious of it, the condition of my neck subconsciously affected my behavior and way of thinking, for example avoiding to talk loudly or for long because it would hurt my neck, avoiding any activity that would require volatile neck movement, etc. It was only two years ago my neck got so bad that I started to feel pain/discomfort noticeably, and since I haven't been able to not think about a second of my life.

So I've been receiving upper cervical chiropractic treatment since February this year, have made couple posts about it. Though there were many ups and downs, my neck condition objectively improved, but I wasn't (nor am I now) confident enough to recommend to others. About three weeks ago, I went in for an ""emergency treatment"" as the pain came back and persisted. The first two days after, the head pressure relieved considerably, but my neck felt like a rusted joint doll. Literally anyway I moved my neck, it would make cracking, squeaking sounds, mostly discomfort but some painful. The next day mostly pain and wanted to drop by for another treatment, but the day after I would feel completely fine. So it's been quite volatile the last few weeks, everyday, even multiple times throughout the day my neck condition changed. Then two days ago, I woke up feeling the best I've ever felt. My head wasn't feeling heavy, I wasn't feeling nauseous and congested just for existing. Although it's not like my brain suddenly became alive full of imaginations and thoughts etc., but definitely made assignments easier that day. I had boxing lesson later that day, and it probably put a lot of stress on my neck, I started feeling heavy and congested in my head again.

That light feeling went away after that day, then today came back after my boxing lesson. I feel comfortable just having my back straight, I still feel some tension throughout my neck and traps, jaws, but considerably less. My neck is usually always hot, tight, and tender, and I think it's because it's always inflamed, but now my neck feels cool to the touch. So I think my neck is definitely improving. I think the next step for me is to keep getting upper cervical treatment, but also work on posture and strength for stability. I think I lived way too long with ill posture, that my body naturally reconfigures to inflame my neck and I have no bodily sense of being in good posture, so I am looking to get help from physical therapy. That will have to happen next year, when I figure out health insurance and get it rolling.

I kept it relatively short and to-the-point (lol) this time. For those suffering similarly and also suspect that their brain fog come from their neck, I'm not at a point to give definite advice, but just want to share my story hopefully as a reference and data point. Best wishes to everyone to find their cure, until next time.

Edit: after spending time in front of computer, I feel my head hot and pressurized, neck tense and hot, and more brain foggy again. After massaging my neck and being more aware of how my neck feels while in front of computer, I feel less hot and pressurized. So there's definitely relationship to neck posture/inflammation and brain fog.",r8yhfk,26,1.0,3,2021-12-04 20:34:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/r8yhfk/the_tldr_neckbrainfog_guy_back_with_an_update/,False,False,2021,12

20,Can chronic stress leave a lasting mark on you?,"I remember being somewhat constantly stressed for a long time when I was 12, I remember my head literally throbbing because of it until one day while I was still 12, I deadass just decided to stop being constantly stressed and that put an end to my chronic stress. I know this might remind some of you of the ""just stop being depressed"" meme but I'm really not messing around.

The manifestation of no longer being chronically stressed was so abrupt that I wonder how my body took it, would I be mistaken to think that my long gone chronic stress could've left a kind of negative lasting mark on me?

I recently turned 16 and have yet to resolve my constant non fluctuant BF, I have this obscure constant and fixed feeling in my head that no one seems to relate to, it's like a Goldilocks type of lightheadedness, it's the baseline amount of lightheadedness that is enough to not make me feel like I'm going to pass out. Imagine my head prior to BF was a full glass of water, well now it's a half full glass of water due to BF.

I have looked into what could be causing my BF, did blood tests, got an X-Ray of my cervical spine, they said there was nothing wrong with but at the time I still did corrective exercises despite feeling no pain due to posture nor having any abnormalities. I heavily invested my time in corrective exercises and I did them for 5 months on and off, surprisingly enough they did relieve my lightheadedness for a brief and short amount of time (2-3 seconds) and that is what motivated me to reach 5 months of doing those exercises, but I now find myself contemplating whether or not my lightheadedness going away briefly because of performing those corrective exercises is just some sort of bizarre coincidence, a false positive or false negative or whatever.

Those corrective exercises were actually extremely insightful though since they revealed that my constant lightheadedness can be relieved but maybe it can be permanently relieved by other means (something different from corrective exercises), and thus relieving my BF, since my lightheadedness is a function of my BF, you can't have one without the other

It's funny that I show no noticeable physical symptoms like fatigue or pain that could help me rule out conditions infinitely easier, my BF symptoms are all cognitive except for that lightheadedness.",rel9c0,20,0.95,1,2021-12-12 09:08:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/rel9c0/can_chronic_stress_leave_a_lasting_mark_on_you/,False,False,2021,12

7,This worked for me,"It´s been two weeks now, so I think it might be too early to tell.  
And could still be placebo.  


I have had brainfog for the last 15 years, and during those years I have switched between coping, and trying to find a solution. Doctors dont know, and they are completely helpless.  


So much money on tests, and supplements, but none has worked.  
I have usually taken one at a time for a couple of months, and then concluded if it worked or not.   


Until now, none have worked.

  
I started taking L-Tyrosine, every morning, and now it´s as good as gone.   
Brainfog is as good as gone, I have started dreaming again, and I sleep good..  Memory has also improved.  
Hopefully that will last.  


From what I have read L-Tyrosine is a precursor to dopamine. So it helps your body use the dopamine that is already there? (If someone knows more, please reply).",sg850o,37,1.0,19,2022-01-30 12:24:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/sg850o/this_worked_for_me/,False,False,2022,1
8,Turns out my brain fog was hypothyroidism,"I have been experiencing brain fog for more than two months now, on and off and it turns out it was from  'hypothyroidism'.

Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) is **a condition in which your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of certain crucial hormones**.

I decided to do blood tests, and they came out today. Turns out my T.S.H ( thyroid stimulating hormon ) was way too high (8.56), which is an indication of a mild hypothyroidisim.

Hypothyroidisim is accompanied with the following symptoms :

\- Forgetfullness

\- Difficulty concentrating

\- Brain fog

\- Weight gain or loss.

Check your TSH levels guys, I thought this might help....

10,Brain Fog Successfully Reduced,"I have reduced my brain fog a LOT in the past few weeks and have been feeling more clearheaded than I have in months. I wanted to share what has helped me so that I can help other people with debilitating brain fog:

1. The most important thing I have done is quit caffeine. I had 2-3 days of withdrawal headaches in my case. I truly think that I have a caffeine sensitivity/intolerance and that this was what was causing my brain fog. Every time I drank coffee I would get immediate bowel movements and often diarrhea afterward. I chalked this up to being the 'laxative' effect of coffee and kept drinking it, but I really think it was wrecking my gut health and contributing to my brain fog. Anyways, I am now off of coffee and once the withdrawal headaches are over, I feel like I have my natural energy back and have actually been able to wake up early rather than waking up at noon or later (after hitting snooze a million times) and still being exhausted like I used to do. I have not drunk tea or eaten chocolate since quitting caffeine because I love the results that I have gotten and don't want to risk the fog coming back, but I think cutting coffee out made the biggest difference out of all caffeine sources. Caffeine can also reduce your quality of sleep which additionally can contribute to brain fog. 

2. I have also been following a whole foods plant-based diet that emphasizes gut-friendly foods. This includes lots and lots of fiber and fermented probiotic foods (ex: sourdough bread, dairy-free probiotic yogurt, pickled beets, tons of fruit and vegetables and legumes and nuts and seeds whole grains). Look up GutHealthMD on Instagram and read his info on the ""gut-brain connection"" and how to optimize your gut microbiota with foods. I have no reason to promote this other than that I believe it has helped me. I have already been plant-based for years but cutting out mostly all processed foods and added sugar has helped me feel my best, and emphasizing these gut-friendly foods has helped improve my brain fog a lot. I try to get as many fruits and vegetables as I can into a meal because the larger the diversity of plants you eat, the better your gut microbe diversity, and the better your gut health. This way of eating has many other health benefits too, not just reducing brain fog. 

&#x200B;

3. Lastly, I take daily vitamin B12 and vitamin D supplements. Most of the population is deficient in these 2 vitamins and they are essential for brain function. Also, stay hydrated!!!! 

&#x200B;

I have been feeling so much better- able to get a normal 8 hours of sleep instead of sleeping 12 or 13  hours and still being tired, and my brain fog is much much better, if not almost completely gone. I have more natural energy as well. 

&#x200B;

\- Complete emotional flatness/deadness. I have had no emotions or any type of feeling whatsoever, cant feel angry, sad, happy, excited etc cant feel vibes or random memories popping up. Or if they do its extremely rare with no feelings associated to them

\- Blank mind, blank head. Its really the only way to decribe it, my head feels utterly blank and empty where all i want to do most of the time is stare at a wall and i cant really imagine things properly anymore its dark and distant.

\- Completely thoughtless or very very few thoughts, no automatic thoughts generated. My internal monologue has been pretty much gone for a while now, although its still slightly there it is extremely muted and my head is eerily quiet most of the time.

\- No desire or motivation to do anything, cant think of anything to do as it feels like im thinking through mud and thoughts don't work properly or associate a feeling with them.

\- Constant fatigue, heavy feeling and sleepiness.

\- Zero sex drive and partially numb genitals.

\- Vision problems, i think its visual snow but everything seems out of focus and blurry but also *sparkly?* like when you push on your eyes and take your hands away but its like that mildly 24/7. I can ignore it but its always there.

\- Zero appetite and lately been feeling like i want to vomit for no reason or just feeling nausea.

16,Brain fog/lack of focus + lack of consistent motivation,"Hello, I'm a 20 year old college student who has had this problem for the last year or so.  I would like to preface that I do not work out and have a very poor sleeping schedule, but these things seem to have little to inverse effects on my problems when I introduce them into my life. 
It started sometime last year (not sure when) as just an issue where, when I ate, (almost any food) I would immediately feel shut down, my whole body would feel tired, and I would want to just go and sleep/lay down. After about two weeks of this, I expressed the issue to my mom and girlfriend who then told me to keep a journal of what I ate, how I felt afterwards, and how long it lasted... Well, about two days after doing that, the issue almost resolved itself, strangely, so I just stopped keeping track and moved on with my life. 

About a month or so after that, I started realizing I was sleeping way WAY later than usual, had an impossible-to-fix problem of falling back asleep over and over again after my alarm (this wasn't unusual for me, but falling back asleep was irresistible now for some reason), and was having a hard time concentrating in general. Over time the symptoms have gotten worse ever so slightly to where now I can't really focus all too well on anything, even the visual side of it. This combined with poor sleep and the eating problem from earlier in the year has made it really difficult to put anything down my throat in the morning and I've gone down to about 1.5 meals on average a day. I have been consistantly getting around 30 Oz of water a day, which is less than recommended, but more than Ive ever drank before in my life leading up to these problems.

My sleep schedule has taken a heavy hit because of all of this, I consistantly need 10+ hours of sleep a day, and will NOT wake up to alarms whatsoever most days.  On the days I do wake up to my alarm, I have a mild whooshing headache for a couple hours and have pretty bad brain fog, although recently the brain fog has felt more and more like the lack of ability to focus my eyes and brain.

Sometimes I have noticed that when I'm having a conversation with someone, I'm mostly talking to a blur, and when I try to focus on them, I feel like I'm not even there, like I'm watching a movie or I'm in some sort of ""Get Out by Jordan Peele"" situation.

I really should have gone to a doctor by now, but life has moved extremely fast like this and I keep telling myself ""I'll get to it when I get to it"" or ""the issue will resolve itself."" I have tried running (for about a week) and I just felt worse off than before. I've tried finding what food makes me feel gross but most of the time it's just eating in general, and I've tried fixing my sleep schedule but I always end up messing it up because of how terrible my condition is right now. 
I've honestly just been terrified of what could be wrong with me and have chosen to suffer over possibly hearing that I have some irreversible illness or something.

If you have any idea of what is wrong with me, please comment and let me know... I will schedule a doctor soon, or so I keep telling myself.",sa18jv,20,0.92,12,2022-01-22 12:12:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/sa18jv/brain_foglack_of_focus_lack_of_consistent/,False,False,2022,1

- sleeping pattern is destroyed
- depressed 
- muscle twitching 
- eye floaters 
- ringing in one ear 
- brain fog (slightly eases up in evening) 
- 0 motivation 0 energy 

I’ve also lost the love of my life on top of all this, dropped out of uni because of it and my life’s fallen apart. 

I’ve had anxiety and first properly noticed it when I was 16 at college, I started smoking a lot of weed which helped me out this went on a year and a half and went through a stressful period even before these symptoms I was having dark thoughts, I then had my covid pfizer vaccine and was smoking weed a day after and had my first ever panic attack where I noticed after it passed I had brain fog. 
I kept smoking weed and it was never the same I used to love being highs but after that the feeling was completely different and eventually had another awful panic attack off it that where I did get dr symptoms, this was 5 months ago and ever since then I’ve had the symptoms I’ve already listed. 


Anyway, I’m not an anti Vaxer in anyway my parents are both scientists and I believe in science but I’m questioning every possibility at this point, Have I had some bad reaction where I’m permanently destroyed? Have I developed als or ms? Am I stuck like this forever? Do I have derealization? Was it the weed? The only time I have relief is when I’m drunk

All this worrying about what it was that caused it makes it so much worse. 


I’ve been to the doctor which cleared my of a brain tumour or MS but other than that she said it was depression but these symptoms have set in since that panic attack, unless I had it before then? The blood work had a folic acid deficiency common with weed apparently 

I’m close to the end friends, I can’t deal with this much longer. I’ve come to terms with dying and relish the relief it will give me and stop this suffering. Can anyone give me any hope?

0,20 years of Brain Fog/chronic fatigue and anxiety finally figured out after trying everything !,"Hi everyone , 

This is my first ever post on Reddit but I feel I owe it to everyone to let you know my journey with Brain Fog, constant fatigue, shortness of breath, headaches at base of skull , spacing out, horrible anxiety (especially when talking to people), on and off emotions and weakness (also I should mention terrible dandruff through this time period)

 So I'll try to make this short but I could go on forever. 

So basically the last 15-20 years I've had all the above symptoms happening on a daily basis. It affected my concentration at school, my ability to learn, couldnt talk to girls, trouble keeping up a conversation( good at faking paying attention but in reality i was spacing out) . I would always have horrible fatigue, anxiety, weird emotions and just a feeling of dumbness and wanting to be left alone.

In my late teens up till present day , I was a regular gym goer, became relatively fit but my energy and previously mentioned symptoms, remained. I kind of accepted it as my personality for most of my twenties until the last few years where I was becoming fed up , and knowing there was something wrong with me. 

After researching and going over the common diagnostics and solutions, I found nothing worked . 
I went Gluten, dairy, cafiene ,egg, meat and sugar free for over a year but felt minimal improvement. I began to feel convinced it had to be my hormones and maybe my Testosterone was rock bottom, but blood tests showed I was in normal range. Then I started to believe I had Crohns disease, Candida overgrowth or a thyroid issue , but everything was healthy and I did a Candida cleanse and no improvement.  

So once again I gave up and accepted my situation . Fast forward to this last year, there was a weekend I was off and my Girlfriend wanted to go out but I felt so exhausted , even though I had plenty of rest and didn't want to do anything. This really upset my Gf and she thought I was making excuses and being lazy , I told her that I'm not doing it on purpose and there's something wrong with me but I don't know what . She wasn't convinced and it led to an argument . I became so angry that I told her that I'll prove it to her that I'm not making it up. 

I decided to go into overdrive mode , repeated all the same tests , went to a neurologist and everything was normal. Finally the youtube algorithm sent me a video on cervical spine misalignement and Hallelujah that was the answer !! :) 

It turns out that when I was a child , I fell on ice and blacked out and ever since then , I cracked my neck out of habit to take the pressure off the stiffness but it became a habit till the present year and most likely caused misalignement of my c1 and c2 vertebrae which ends up compressing nerves and restricting blood flow to your brain (hence the fatigue and anxiety).  I immediately stopped cracking my neck , went to a chiropractor for neck adjustments and I can proudly say that was the cause of it all ! :) 

So if you are someone with a horrible neck cracking habit, and have no idea what caused your brain fog , stop cracking your joints and see a chiropractor.

  I hope this helps.  🙏",sotwxs,244,0.98,75,2022-02-10 01:36:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/sotwxs/20_years_of_brain_fogchronic_fatigue_and_anxiety/,False,False,2022,2
1,Some ideas to try to cure brain fog,"Brain fog sucks. I think I have had some form it since childhood. It has worsened a lot now in my 30's. I have spent countless hours on reddit trying to find something. In process, I have copied helpful comments from fellow redditors which I am sharing with you in hopes some of you may find something useful in it.

Before we get started, these are some helpful terms you should know and their common symptoms. Alexithymia, SDAM, Aphantasia, ADHD and its subtypesand common symtoms, OCD sub types, Chronic Inflammation, Gut brain axis

I share in comments below 56 ideas to alleviate brain fog. I havent formatted the list or consolidated the ideas. So, there will be some discrepancy. Kindly excuse. If some kind soul wants to create a better version of this list and share that would be brilliant.

3,Immediate relief of brain fog is achieved by restoration of abdominal (core) muscles tone,"# 1. The main finding

In this report, immediate (within 1-3 seconds) relief of brain fog symptoms is observed when the abdominal muscles (transversus abdominis, external oblique, internal oblique) tone is restored either by voluntary equilateral contraction of these muscles or by their transcutaneous electrostimulation (EMS-TENS device) in two adult males (\~30 y.o., BMI= 20 and 24). The effective absence of brain fog-symptoms is sustained as long as the tone of the abdominal muscles is maintained, i.e. as the muscles tone is lost, the symptoms reappear. This finding suggests that brain fog in the studied subjects is caused by the absent muscle tone of the abdominal muscles (or one can say core muscles).

# 2. TENS/EMS details

The approximate elecrodes placement is marked red in the photo 1. The placement is laterally symmetrical, slihtly below the ribs and above the belly button line. One of the cheapest awailable TENS/EMS device (photo 2) was used with its dedault (first) mode of stimulation with maximal speed (could be \~15Hz or so) and low to moderate intensity setting. The electrode area was \~15 cm^(2).

# 3. The mechanism of the effect

We hypotesize that the most likely mechanism responsible of such a link between cognitive function of the brain and fuctional state of the abdominal muscles could be the brain stimulation by proprioceptive signaling from the muscles. That is, complelely inactive mucles (which have no tone at all) do not send the proper amount of proprioceptive signals to the brain which results in understimulation and compromised cognitive performance which is symtomatically similar to the brain fog. Since brain fog relief is observed at both voluntary contraction and TENS/EMS-assisted contraction, we can conclude that the TENS/EMS is not the main cause of the effect but its role is mainly the assistance of the muscle contraction.

Perhaps, also the normalization of the serotonin levels in the brain can play a role in this result, as it is said that ""proprioceptive input causes a release of Serotonin"" \[1\] in the brain and serotonin is one of the main neurotransmitters regulating many aspects of the brain functioning.

Another mechanism could be the change in the neck position due to the kinetic chain-related improvement of neck posture (details further) since in the chiropractor community there is a hypothesis that something like ""the compression of the spinal cord caused by improper neck vertebra position causes brain fog"" \[2,3\]. However, the brain fog relief as a result of a chiropractor's manipulation might still be explained just by the restoring tone of the muscles after such manipulation without the need of involving additional mechanisms like the spinal cord compression.

# 4. Some discussion

Among physiotherapists and other muscle specialists, there is a concept of so-called kinetic chains, which describes the linkage in the function and force application between the muscles across the body \[4\]. In particular, the tone absence of abdominal muscles is often associated with inactive thoracic extensors, gluteus Maximus, some leg muscles as well as poor posture in general. Since the abdominal (core) muscles are likely to be in the very beginning of kinetic chains, their tone absence may be the cause of the tone absence in many other muscles that are linked to them through kinetic chains. Therefore, restoration of the core muscles' tone will lead to the tone restoration of many other muscles around the body which will additionally provide proprioceptive signals stimulating the brain. An argument supporting this speculation is that proper engaging of abdominal muscles (TA, EO, IO) often improves overall posture, increases the ease of motion and the range of motion of the limbs.

# 5. Why this is hardly the ""magical cure""

The answer to the question of why there is no tone of abdominal muscles in the first place can be much more complex. The exercise-related muscle overload, nutrition problems, stress, activity/rest balance, increased inflammation, various types of illnesses, etc.. With the exception of the muscle itself-related causes (like trauma, atrophy-weakness, or overload-related fatigue), there can be many other physiological reasons, the set of which will likely intersect substantially with the set of already commonly ascribed potential causes of brain fog.

The other problem with the muscles is that most people have underdeveloped abdominal muscles, especially the obliques, which will fatigue out and become inhibited quite quickly even under low static load, therefore the positive effect on the brain function won't last for long. Another problem is that even more people just don't have the skills to voluntarily equilateraly contract their abdominal muscles and presumably some proportion of the elderly won't be able to contract those muscles at all. The aid of EMS could be the way to overcome these obstacles and to help to teach (via establishing some kind of neuromuscular feedback) the individuals how to properly voluntarily contract the muscles.

On the other hand, there are individuals with substantially impaired overall muscular function or disabilities that still have fair enough cognition. This suggests that there can be an adaptation of the brain which provides compensation for the lack of muscle proprioception signaling or the hypothesis about the significance of proprioceptive stimulation is wrong in general. Though, the general elderly population usually demonstrates quite a simultaneous decline in both physical and cognitive performance with age.

# 6. The list of ""brain fog"" symptoms experienced by the studied subjects which are reduced by the restoration of muscle tone:

Cognitive symptoms:

* Short term memory problems (forgetfulness)
* Difficulty concentrating
* Easily distracted
* Can easily forget intensions
* Difficulties in multitasking
* Hard to hold several thoughts simultaneously
* Slow and difficult to formulate complex thoughts and sentences in writing
* “Slow” thinking
* Feels like your brain “pauses” for a second every several seconds
* Increased rate of OCD-like behavior (e.g. itching-scratching, touching hair, skin, or things, other repetitive behaviors like straightening your clothes)
* Comprehensible speech not related to you distracts you substantially when you are performing cognitively intense tasks (like writing)
* Increased rate of cravings and procrastination
* Increased irritability and tendency for aggression

Physical symptoms often associated with “brain fog”:

* Involuntary blinking quite often: more than few times a minute
* Feeling fatigue
* Feeling cold
* Shallow, Intermittent, or sporadic breathing
* Yawning
* Body muscle aches (often in low back or neck)
* Feeling a bit clumsy when you move: also balancing difficulties
* Sitting or standing still feels uncomfortable
* Intermittent difficulties in focusing your vision
* Difficulties falling asleep
* Going upstairs feels difficult

# 7. The author's commentary

As the author of this report, I must say that although I have some experience in scientific research and writing \[5,6\] - currently I don't have any particular background in physiology/neurology except for the conceptions I picked up from articles on the web and some channels on youtube. However since the reported effect seems quite ""disrupting"" of the common conceptions about brain fog, I believe I should publish it ""right now and as is"" as at this moment I'm not certain whether I will be able to continue studying this topic (I am in Ukraine - there is ongoing war here right now).

The aim of this report is to register the observed findings in the global knowledge base of humanity and to attract the attention of the specialists and professionals who have the ability to design a proper scientific investigation of these findings with using a large variety of subjects (instead of only two subjects), using proper objective tests of cognitive performance and its changes, and finding the effects of variation of EMS stimulation technique so that such a study will determine the proportion and the subset of population in which the found effect is the most significant. I can guess this subset might be teens and young adults who have (among other brain fog-like criteria) poor posture, and maybe some degree of ADHD, anxiety, or depression.

For those who are the most susceptible, a strategy of increasing abdominal muscles endurance enough to maintain a fair degree of muscle tone during the usual activities should be developed, provided that the other causes (illness, inflammation, other conditions) besides the muscles weakness itself are excluded.

I had plans of publishing this report as a preprint on a popular preprint server but currently, I don't have enough time to make it ""scientific"" enough to be considered a decent preprint. As in the current state, this report is obviously lacking a proper physiological /neurological /kinesiological background and argumentation based on the actual peer-reviewed literature and also has a too-small sample size.

4,Cured my brain fog,"I'm writing this because a post here finally helped me cure my brain fog.

My brain fog started 6 months ago. It started gradually getting worse each day. Would usually clear at night and start when making breakfast in the morning. I was starting to get it all day. I was convinced it was a long Covid symptom except I never had Covid. Then I thought it was a vaccine reaction. Anyway doctors all thought I had anxiety and wanted to put me on anti depressants. I tried everything from acupuncture vitamens etc... 

Then one thing I noticed was that my brain fog always cleared when I lay down. So I started to think maybe it had something to do with my posture. So I started to sit up straight and stand straight.. and sure enough it went away. A post here I read that someone went to a chiropractor to sort their brain fog and that gave me the clue that it's a vertibrea mis alignment.. probably caused by 2 years on a laptop in bed. 

Anyway I hope this helps someone else who might have the same thing.",spuha1,37,0.97,7,2022-02-11 08:26:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/spuha1/cured_my_brain_fog/,False,False,2022,2

I literally have no thoughts in my mind, I could stare at a wall and no thought will pass my mind. I could be asked a question and no thought will pass my mind either.

Is anyone having the same issue? I'm convinced that I used to have thoughts before my brain fog occurred. But now my brain is just empty, blank.

6,brain fog = inflammation.. update!,"Hi! Another update here.. just wanted to say that brain fog = inflammation is only *part* of the answer. All of you who have already suggested this were right! 
(For context, I'm 31 y/o fm who doesn't drink, smoke, or do drugs - I know, I'm boring lol.)

I'll preface my post with a question: have any of you found that sinus/ENT surgery helped with your brain fog?

For *many* years I've had brain fog/speech issues, constant tonsillar lymph node pain, intermittent night sweats, extreme fatigue, low grade fevers, nasal regurgitation, anterior neck pressure/pain, and constant eye inflammation. I incorrectly attributed these to thyroid issues. 
In the past five or so years, it seems to have gotten so much worse; I have all those symptoms plus a constant sore throat feeling in my nose and back of my throat, itchy ears with flaky wax, wet cough and constant larynx irritation, intermittent intractable HAs that migrates down back of neck with scalp pain (feels like mild meningitis), intermittent dizziness, intermittent mastoiditis pain, cobblestone throat, tonsil pain and pitting, constant post nasal drip, and constant clogged/muffled ears. 

I've had allergy testing in the past, which was negative for everything. My symptoms do not change with food, seasons, or with locations, I've lived in the northeast, southeast, and Midwest.. symptoms are all the same.
I also always try to stay hydrated. I've also tried: nasal sprays, corticosteroids, antiinflammatories, decongestants, otc allergy meds, and antihistamines. 
Weirdly, the nasal sprays actually make me feel worse. Antiinflammatories/steroids temporarily relieve the brain fog. I've even recently tried doxycycline and amoxicillin, which have completely helped, but once I stopped a two week round of them, all my symptoms returned.

I told this to the otolaryngologist and the fact that my lymphocytes lab was high. I told him that because of this I suspect I have an ongoing infection. I don't think it's allergy related bc my past allergy test was negative and my labs show normal eosinophils, normal ESR, ANA, and CRP. This doc only told me that I'm a ""difficult patient"" bc of my symptoms and the imaging and lab results. he didn't even review my labs sent to him. He never reviewed the ultrasound that indicates I have abnormal tonsillar lymph nodes. He didn't scope or examine my ears, nose, or throat. Before I had the CT he told me there's no way that I have adenoids but the CT shows that I do have adenoids.  The CT scan also shows complete ethmoid opacification, deviated septum, paranasal thickening, and inflamed turbinates. Ive also been diagnosed with vocal cord dysfunction and eustachian tube dysfunction.

My suspicion is that I have an ongoing staph and/or fungal colonization infection thats causing my symptoms and inflammation. He refuses to order an aerobic nasal culture, that I told him would be useful in ruling out bacterial or fungal infection. 

The office visit consisted of him making creepy advances with him inappropriately repeatedly massaging my neck and touching my thigh while saying ""Im not going to hurt you.""
And he's also commented on how men's balls hang and how women's boobs hang instead of addressing my symptoms and helping me. This is healthcare in America. Disgusting and incompetent doctors get away with anything because of their title. And if you cure a patient, you lose a customer.

10,My brain fog gets worse after I eat,"Hi there, I'm currently having brain fog, or that's what I know what's this called, probably because two weeks ago I bought a sweetener that's contaminated by gluten. I stopped eating gluten a year ago and my depression and most of my ADD symptoms are gone, but when I eat them again, I would feel this weird feeling in my head, I would do something very clumsy, and then my depression would be back. I don't know if I have celiac or just intolerance, but I never thought eating gluten would make me want to kill myself or feel like crazy. I found out the sweetener I used to drink tea (to ease my brain fog) contains gluten 2 days ago and have stopped consuming it since then, but my head still doesn't get any better. After I eat, the brain fog is so severe, it's hard to describe, but my perception and orientation is weird, I feel like everything is far, I can't really think, I feel like I'm dreaming, and the more I try to describe it, the more I feel like I'm crazy. I just moved to a new country very far from my home and from my family and I live alone. Luckily I've been going to some professionals for my mental health, that's why right now I feel like I can still handle it. But I know that the people around me will never understand what it is and some of them might think I'm just making things up. So here I am trying to feel less alone and less crazy. I hope it will do something good and I hope I will get better soon. I will go to a GP tomorrow but I still have to work in the morning, wish me luck (or not, I might be talking to myself).

What I don't know is how long is this brain fog supposed to lasts after I stopped eating gluten, does anyone know? Also I don't know how to face my coworker. How do you go on with working, what do you tell your coworker? I feel guilty having a sick leave over this, I told my boss I had indigestion because I think saying brain fog would sound weird??

13,My top 3 theories based on my experience,"1) We spend so much time lying/sitting around that our CORE MUSCLE degenerated. Core muscle helps with digestive sys by strengthening bowel movements and intestines. Lot of studies that show digestion/bacteria in stomach affects mental health. They also help stablize lower back/spine thus helping us maintain healthy posture. 
(I believe we carry tension/flex the wrong parts of out stomach to compensate for the weakened parts of our core stomach and that cause out posture to be off balanced/stomach issues)

2) stressful events like family, financial issues, r/cptsd, etc. These are real threat to safety that makes body go into fight or flight, depression, anxiety, etc. 

3) easy to rule out things like chronic dehydration, low vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, omega 3 fatty acid, sleep apnea, and low iron (esp if you’re a women and feel dizzy when standing up quick)",sjokee,20,0.92,12,2022-02-03 17:13:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/sjokee/my_top_3_theories_based_on_my_experience/,False,False,2022,2

2,Brain fog 95% improved!,"Since the end of last September I have been suffering with EXTREMELY debilitating brain fog and mental fatigue. I'm pretty sure my case was the worst on this sub or at least that's what it felt like to me. I constantly felt like I lived in a dream, hard to think and have clear thoughts. I felt 150 years old and barely had any internal monologue and the brainpower of that in a dream. Intense derealization 24/7 and off balance lightheaded feeling when walking arouns. Felt like I was going crazy and lost control of my own brain. Couldn't even read most posts on this sub completely as my reading speed was extremely slow. My vision felt off like there was a layer between me and reality and it took time for me to process surroundings. I wanted to kill myself it was that bad. Extremely difficult to hold conversations and working memory was absolute dogshit. Attention span of a goldfish. Almost lost my fulfilling career as an engineer as well. Didn't go anywhere over the last half a year other than get groceries and do laundry because my brain fog was just so bad. Spent most time in bed as that felt slightly better. Couldn't watch TV or movies as they weren't enjoyable and too much cognitive work. How did I fix this? The fucking chiropractor! I had loss of lordosis and cervical disk Malrotations and forward straight neck curve from years of forward head posture. This chiro has been working on my neck since January this year and I should have my neck completely fixed by the summer and I'm sure the brain fog should 100% resolve by then. My brain feels normal for once and I cried when I finally felt like my brain isn't broken anymore! I'll keep you guys posted! 

Get you neck checked! And make sure your chiropractor is the cream of the crop. He is one of the top rated ones in my state and not all chiropractors are equal. I tried soany supplements and diets and got into a darker place when nothing worked. Bottom line is that there is absolutely a reason why your brain fog is there. Find out what it is and never quit. I thought I was screwed for life and am so glad I never stopped trying to figure it out and it was so hard to even do research with my broken brain, almost like trying to solve a complicated situation in your dream and like you can't get out of the dream until you solve it. I was always so happy to see people on this sub cure there brain fog but I accepted that I probably would NEVER cure mine. I honestly feel like I won the lottery, like nothing in this world mattered to me if I had this brain fog, and I actually fucking fixed it which I thought was damn near impossible. It was so fucking bad guys I wanted to die everday. When I felt better it's like I woke up out of a coma.

I appreciate all the support from you guys and of I didn't see stories about people fixing their neck then I would've never gave the chiropractor a shot. Also keep in mind that it took a few months of neck work to get to where I am this morning where I finally woke up and felt that my brain is back to normal.  Love you guys and never give up on figuring out what is causing your brain fog! Ima head outta this sub as it brings up very traumatic memories of me wanting to kill myself and so I can move onto the next chapter of my life and live happily ever after lol this story actually has a happy ending(:

Edit* For clarification on why I say 95% instead of 100% My alertness, reading speed, energy, mental clarity, ability to think very clearly, creative power, multitasking abilities, and working memory are all back 100%. All of my memories came back with full clarity as well! The only residual fog is so tiny it doesn't even matter to be honest, and it's just that I usually remember names very well but sometimes I forget a name unless I interact with this person enough, which is something I've always kinda had lol I don't know if I'd call it brain fog.",tyffmv,104,0.94,114,2022-04-07 15:23:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/tyffmv/brain_fog_95_improved/,False,False,2022,4

i vividly remember times where i was at bbq or school lunch table completely stonefaced and silent. i’m still this way today. words don’t spontaneously flow when i’m speaking or writing, because they have no where from which to flow… it’s like i’m devoid of constructive/original thought.

most of my thoughts consist of rumination on past events, metacognition (thinking about my lack of thinking/why i can’t contribute), or superficial trivia... 

i struggle with lengthy conversations, story telling, and long-form writing… anything that requires long serial thought streams. 

i’m slow to respond in conversation because my thinking is slow… and i can’t retrieve the right words… my conversations tend to be short and awkward.. and people consider me stuck up because i tend to withdraw and just keep to myself. it’s caused me to become socially anxious because struggle in most social settings.

… additionally my opinions aren’t my own. i just parrot other opinions/view points i find compelling. i struggle to deeply analyze material and arrive at my own conclusions… even the opinions i parrot i struggle i struggle to defend… it all makes sense from my school performance… i was good at tasks that required memorization but poor with anything that required higher level reasoning. 

i blame all of this for my social awkwardness, poor problem solving and critical thinking, and lack of creative output… additionally, i find that i compensate for my lack of substance by embellishing on my accomplishments in order to impress through other means.

luckily i’ve been self aware enough to try everything under the sun to solve for this: strenuous exercise/lifting, very clean/heathy eating, brain training, breathwork, cold showers, meditation. mental/social frameworks, custom probiotics, getting outside my comfort zone… but everything has resulted i  marginal improvements. 

at this point i think i might just be stupid. seriously that might be the only explanation. 

…i’m in a weird place where i’ve identified my problems, tried different methods to solve for them, and after years have gotten no where. 

i feel like i’ve missed out on a lot experiences i should’ve had in my younger years because of this… i’m entering the second quarter of my life and i don’t want the pain to continue.

the whole ‘accept yourself’ thing is cool but i cant accept being this way.

10,"5 days without brainfog for the first time in months, might have found the source after 2 excruciating years!","I started having brainfog about 2 years ago, alongside shoulder/back/neck pains, I didn't take it really serious at first thinking I was just tired and not having enough exercise. I had a lot of issues with my sinuses also and thought that was causing the brainfog (I still called it headache, not even knowing the concept of ""brainfog""). Over the past 2 years I started visiting several doctors because it became worse, I had head CT's, sinus CT's, taste/smell tests, allergy tests, physiotherapy, ... I found and read through this entire sub ... but nothing was found that could be causing the brainfog.

I mostly pulled through for the first year and a half using energy drinks and nootropics until it became absolutely unbearable the past 3 months. Energy drinks and nootropics were not cutting it anymore and I was essentially unable to work anymore. Since it became worse, I visited my doctor again to see what other examinations were still left because my quality of life was dropping hard and fast. She advised neurological examinations since all else fell flat so far. 

While she was giving me the info for the neurological examination, I also asked if she could prescribe anything for my back/shoulder/neck pain in the meantime. She prescribed a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (Diclofenac, 75mg) and OMG, the day after I started taking it, pretty much ALL my symptoms went away. No more brainfog (none!), no more pressure behind/above my eyes, a lot less pain in back/shoulders/neck ... for 5 days now since I started the drug!

A new minor annoyance/symptom had shown up 2 weeks ago, which I had mentioned to my doctor but she didn't really do anything with it. My upper and lower teeth weren't fitting onto each-other anymore in the same way they always had. One of my upper-teeth was hitting a lower-teeth different when I closed my mouth. It was only a very very small difference but enough to notice, which had to mean my jaw had moved somehow, because none of my teeth are loose. 

Flabbergasted by the result of the drug, I did some more research online and included the new issue with my teeth and I ended up finding this article [Is It All in Your Head? | TMJ Disorder - It might be in your head…but not in the way you think. It might be in your jaw, in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ)](https://www.vitalheadandspine.com/blog/2017/7/5/is-it-all-in-your-head) and wow ... the list of symptoms is almost _exactly_ what I have been going through. I visited my physiotherapist today and had him check my jaws and he said there's definitely something wrong with it. There's waaaaay too much tension on my jaws, which can have been building over years. The weird thing is I have never really had any pain in my jaws, unless I push on the sides just below my ears, but I thought that was normal for some reason.

I still need to have an official examination to confirm it's TMJ related but there's a very very good chance it is, the symptoms are just too similar. So instead of the neurological examination, I'm going to have this checked asap by a specialist. In the meantime, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug still works but is very bad for the stomach so I can't keep taking this for very long.

I know there are a lot of potential reasons for brainfog but if this gets _one_ more person looking in the right direction for their issue, this post will be all worth it.

The best to all of you and I'll follow up if I know more.

11,Got diagnosed and results showed obvious impairments,"Hello friends! I was on this sub a lot last year while I was in the process of getting diagnosed. I've had brain fog (used as a catch all for my symptoms) for most of my life and once posted all of my symptoms here and was very heartened by the response. Many of you said you could relate to me and were going through exactly what I was. [Here is the post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/lvu8kd/if_this_helps_anyone_here_is_my_full_list_of/)

I took a large collection of tests meant to test my intellectual functioning. I thought I was really making all of my symptoms up or wasn't trying hard enough. But upon getting my results back, there were obvious impairments. On the formal IQ test, I was found to have high comprehension and perceptual reasoning, but poor working memory and exceptionally low processing speed. On other tests, I was shown to struggle with time-related tasks and rated very high in comprehension again, but with a low reading rate. My verbal memory was the worse, falling within the 16th percentile. There were also clinical observations noting that I took a long time to formulate answers before speaking. I also rated highly for psychological distress.

So that's going to be different for everyone. I have the benefit of being able to get tested, I actually got multiple diagnoses in the end. All that to say, if any of you have imposter syndrome, you're not making it up. So many of you related to my symptoms. I thought my results would come back normal because of the imposter syndrome but no, I am obviously struggling with my memory and other areas. Not to say something is only legitimate once it's on paper, but it certainly helps if you have trouble validating your struggles. Best of luck friends!

Edit: My tests were ordered by a neuropsychologist. I went to a practice that specifically tests for ADHD/Autism/learning disabilities for accommodations. Here is a list of the exact tests ([https://imgur.com/a/Zr4NwYh](https://imgur.com/a/Zr4NwYh)) that were ordered and included in my report. The entire test battery was completed over 4 4-hour sessions and also included a patient history from the intake, observational notes, and a clinical interview on my trauma experience since it could be a contributing factor. All the tests were administered by a psychologist and she then convened with the neuropsychologist over my results.

I also have Hashimotos which is an autoimmune thyroid disease so I'm sure that contributes to my brain fog. 

On the same list above, I included the recommendations they gave me. Please take this with a grain of salt bc they were recommendations made specifically for my results after hours of testing and could be different for everyone. Hope it's helpful\~",teeanw,37,1.0,22,2022-03-15 02:19:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/teeanw/got_diagnosed_and_results_showed_obvious/,False,False,2022,3
12,"Check your neck & posture, please!","In 2013, when I was around 14, I started to develop sharp stabbing pains in my lower back when playing sports at school — anything to do with running you bet I’d feel it. A trip to the chiro & an X-ray later revealed I had what’s referred to as a military neck or simply a straight neck, something my chiropractor mentioned he’d had never seen in anyone as young as I was.  
I was treated with regular visits & started using a neck roller at home. Unfortunately being young & naive I stopped using it once I started seeing results & the pain disappeared.

Fast forward to 2022, I’m back at the same same place going through the same treatment all over again but this time with a new perspective & good idea of what my poor neck posture was doing to my cognitive & general health. I’ve also found a video (linked below) that hits the nail on the head for what was essentially my norm for what’s well over a decade now — I’m talking severe brain fog, adhd, depression, anxiety, chronic fatigue, vision problems (like my eyes didn’t know where to look), pressure behind forehead, super stiff back, shoulders & neck, no sex drive & essentially no positive emotions. I was a shell of a person, & I’m honestly only just starting to really ground myself again and wake up to the fact I’m like.. an actual person, not just an NPC that exists for the sake of existing and pleasing everybody — I’m just functioning on a whole new level of consciousness I didn’t think was possible.

My brain fog isn’t 100% gone yet, but It’s on its way there & I couldn’t ask for anything better.

please stay hopeful everybody & don’t settle for this numb misery just because it’s normal. 🙏

13,Struggling with feeling life is meaningless.,"I don't know how to deal with the inability to think. Life is so bleak, in this state not being able to think properly. Exercise and meditation help, but they are only ephemeral relief to this crippling brainfog. On my worst days, I can't even form conversations. Most days I can, but anything academic completely goes over my head. I don't know how to look forward to life. Without the ability to think, my life completely loses its meaning. Being able to form my own ideas has been my reason to live for as long as I can remember, and to have that taken away from me, I don't know how to feel. I feel so incredibly disconnected and  by these symptoms.

14,6 years until now,"This is my first real post here on reddit, I would like to share my experience with brain fog, fatigue and chronic pain over the last 6 years in hopes that it may be of use to someone. As I share what has helped me I recommend that you take it onboard by looking into these options further as I am an advocate for questioning everything and doing your own research. Decide for yourself how far you want to go to find relief or a cure that works for you.

I have struggled for 6 years with chronic back pain which shortly after resulted in me also suffering with brain fog. It was so debilitating to the point where I was unable to work and bed ridden for 2 years. I am 28 years old now and finally my symptoms have subsided enough to bring some normalcy back into my life. I didn’t think it would be possible and I am sure many of you are on the same boat, looking for anything that will improve not just brain fog but also overall health and wellbeing.

Here are the lifestyle changes that have reduced my symptoms
 
1. Low Carb Diet
1. Intermittent Fasting
1. No processed or artificial sugar
2. Spoonful of sauerkraut daily (with live bacteria/probiotics for gut health and digestion)
2. 30 minute walk daily (started with 10 minutes and worked my way up)
3. L-theanine (helps with my ability to socialize)
3. Nicotine spray (not a smoker, it just keeps me focused)
3. Blueberries (for their flavonoid properties to the brain)
3. Prolotherapy or PRP (injections that assist with healing damaged connective tissue and tendons for better joint health and mobility)
3. No fap
4. Using a pull-up bar (decompresses the spine)
4. 3 Eggs daily from our own chickens (rich in folate and other nutrients)
4. Little to no caffeine intake (lowers cortisol levels in the body)",tspoll,31,1.0,13,2022-03-31 02:31:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/tspoll/6_years_until_now/,False,False,2022,3
15,Found the problem: epilepsy!,"21M, blood tests 👍

So I've been struggling with brain fog for a few years now (2-3) and couldn't pinpoint the cause. At first I thought (and doctors did too) it was ADHD and I was put on stimulants.

I tried Ritalin, Vyvanse and Modafinil. They helped me get my ass off the couch but I felt like it was off.

So, after I started working last year I noticed I'd randomly go absent during mundane tasks (which I thought were just ADHD attention lapses). This would last around 1-5 minutes and I'd feel a bit off for several more. This kept happening and I didn't really pay attention to it. When I was a student I just thought I was bored. With my current knowledge, I'd say those were ""small"" seizures(absence).

Then, a few months later, I started feeling like I'd fall randomly, out of the blue. A few days later, it happened. I had a grand-mal. The worst. I think I had it 2 times before that but I thought they were panic attacks.

So I went to a emergency psychiatrist that told me to go to a neurologist and bam. Obvious. Epilepsy, CID G40.2. It fits way better

Now I'm working with the doc and the first medication I tried gave me severe allergy. Well, at least now I know what I'm dealing with.",ts46i8,27,0.94,3,2022-03-30 11:21:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/ts46i8/found_the_problem_epilepsy/,False,False,2022,3

17,Feels like my brain is falling apart!,"Over the last months, i feel like my brain has started to fall apart. My head hurts constantly, and painmedication and physical therapy has not worked.

I am in medical school, and used to be really smart. Now i Feel like i have no cognitive function left. I cant understand what i read, and simple tasks are overwhelming. I struggle to watch tv and just read normal books also. Its like my brain is blank and wont process anything.

I also struggle with loss of emotions and sense of self. Nothing gives me dopamine-release and i Feel dead inside with no idea what to do.

I also experience sound and vision distortion. When i look at the tv or the iPad/iPhone it’s like the image is either to small, too far away or too close, like not normal. Sometimes i have issues focusing my eyes on the screen and the image is weird. Sometimes i can see i can ser the TV, but my brain just cant process whats happening. Very distressing. My vision is also blurry.

I also struggle to focus on sounds. Its either to loud, to far away or i just cant detect where its coming from. Sound can also sound weird, more sharp and static.

It feels like the sound comes in each ear but my brain does not make it into one sound.

When i put my earbuds in to listen to music, i cant hear the music properly. Its like its trapped in the back of my head and muffled. I find this very distressing, because i literally cant listen to music anymore. I also have a giant cotton ball (sometimes feels like a brick) in the back of my head where i hear the distorted music! Literally feels this inside my brain!
