1,"I'm a COVID-19 nurse in an intensive care unit, and I can't cope","Hello. 

I'm 26 year old and currently work at a COVID-19 ward full of very ill patients.   
I've never struggled as much as I am right now. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I am isolating myself from everyone because I'm afraid of making them ill. I have nothing left to give.",fsmc3h,1467,0.99,151,2020-03-31 22:00:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fsmc3h/im_a_covid19_nurse_in_an_intensive_care_unit_and/,False,False,2020,3

3,Nobody talks about the after attempt,"I tried to kill myself. I overdosed heavily on a cocktail of pills and medicines. The advice i have? Don't. Nobody talks about the aftermath of when somebody saves your life. The people who know you are torn apart by grief even though you survived. And you get to see it. And you also get to see everybody talk to you as if on eggshells, treat you like you're a kicked puppy.  And the guilt is worse than that before. Because you caused that and they won't admit it to you. The guilt is soul destroying. And then there's you. Your stomach can't handle anything but water and plain bread. The sharp stabbing pains and rises of nausea that knock you off your feet. The shaking for no reason- entire body failing to function correctly at any given moment. Sleep? No. You will wake up routinely every hour or so. And that's if you can fall asleep after fighting your guilt over trying and the physical pain its caused on top of what made you try in the first place. Oh. And when you finally think your body has recovered? Its worse. You cant go out without being drained and you have literally liquid shit. Like youre peeing out of your ass. Water can even make you feel sick. 

Okay sure. You wanna die. But a lot don't succeed. And the failure is grim. I have liver damage, my stomach linings are non existent. I'm suffering more than before and i could never try again because of who i affected and the damage i've done.

Edit: it's been 3 weeks. I have to take medication for my stomach otherwise the pain is horrible and i am still just shitting and vomiting stomach acid",f6vgg2,1026,0.99,158,2020-02-20 16:24:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f6vgg2/nobody_talks_about_the_after_attempt/,False,False,2020,2
4,"If you make enough suicide attempts, people stop caring.","That’s what I feel has happened to me. It’s like I don’t have the right to say “I’m sad” anymore because I either get ignored or eye rolls. 

I’ve come up with a pretty fool-proof way to strangle myself while I am unconscious, and I have decided to have another go at trying to die (this is my fifth attempt, my first I put a gun to head and chickened out, second I stranded myself in the wilderness, third I tried to mix pills, and fourth I basically drank poison).

I didn’t think it mattered, being supported. 

Maybe it’s seeing friends cut me out of their lives one by one. Maybe it’s family looking annoyed and just saying “I’m sorry you feel like this.” Maybe it’s my marriage partner flat-out saying nothing when I tell him I want to die. Maybe it’s my mental condition that causes me constant grief and pain, then shoots me up to mania so I feel like I have no control of my life. Maybe it’s because I’m spending my life savings just sitting at home jobless, I don’t contribute to society, I should be allowed to be euthanized. 

Thanks for listening like usual r/suicidewatch, I appreciate it, no one else wants to. Though you have my gratitude, I hope I never post here again, because I will finally be successful.",ffcy1q,1010,0.99,85,2020-03-08 14:04:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ffcy1q/if_you_make_enough_suicide_attempts_people_stop/,False,False,2020,3

6,Anyone else going to miss the part of them that could have been so great?,"The real part of yourself. The part that had dreams and ambitions. The part that dreamt of meeting someone you could fall in love with. The part that used to get comfort from things so simple such as showering, sleeping and eating your favourite foods. Maybe movies, tv shows or sports that made you feel alive and hopeful. The innocent part, now buried by the pain inflicted by your mind. This is not a post of optimism, more just typing what floats in my complex mind.

I think we all knew the potential we once had, and could not imagine things to flip so unfairly. Some recover, others don’t. Others endure the pain knowing they can never break free but accepting it. Some can’t end their lives due to the pain, others can more easily. 
I used to think I wouldn’t miss living if I died. 

But I don’t think that’s true. I would miss the part of me buried deep within. Not the part swarmed by all these mental illnesses, but the part of me that was inclusive, kind and dreamy. Realism is a terrible thing for people suffering, with no indication of improvement. And the way hope plays on your mind and pulls you back, can be a terrible thing too. Do not let hope control your life. Personally, no matter how comforting hope can be, it has a harmful agenda in the long run. What if the hoping never ends.",fqtx8q,982,1.0,65,2020-03-28 22:18:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fqtx8q/anyone_else_going_to_miss_the_part_of_them_that/,False,False,2020,3

13,found and performed cpr on dead friend/looking for help,"I found my best friend dead from hanging herself just under 3 weeks ago now, I called the ambulance and untied her and gave her CPR for 12-14 minutes before anyone showed up. They ended up working on her for 60-90 minutes and got a faint heart beat back and she was put into an induced coma. I had to call her boyfriend and ex/best friend and we all spent the night in the ICU. I spent a week in shock, meeting her parents who flew in from interstate. Her father thanked me for giving them the opportunity to say goodbye to her. For the first  6 days it seemed there was such a low chance of her making any kind of recovery that we were just waiting for her family to decide to withdraw life support. I had begun grieving, although I was by her bed most days and evenings brushing her hair talking to her and reading to her from our favorite poetry books. On about day 6/7 they decided to take her off sedation and see what would happen and she ended up opening her eyes in front of me for the first time. It was a miracle, and it was also the saddest part reflectively of the entire experience. All she could do was lay and sob. I spent a few days with her like this. I would talk to her and I knew she could hear me because there would be certain things she would cry about and then certain things I would say would calm her back down. It was so incredibly painful. I was convinced over these days I had ruined her life by doing what I did. She was dead when I found her and that I had brought her back to a life of hell. It was my worst fear that she would stay in that state forever, I just couldn’t wrap my head around how incredibly unjust that would be. She ended up within 24 hours of having her breathing tube taken out and her sedation completely ceased able to start breathing on her own, speaking a little and even started moving. It’s all been so surreal. Now that shock has worn off I’m having constant flash backs and panic attacks. I have constant invasive thoughts of killing my self. It’s so painful. I truly want to die, I feel so conflicted and invisible. Because she is recovering our mutual friends almost have forgotten just how traumatic this experience has been for her first and foremost (and realistically this is only just the beginning of a very painful road for her...) and traumatised I am from finding her, untying her, giving her cpr while I knew she was dead, cleaning the blood off the door she was hanging from, and spending 2 straight weeks by her side through every single state in ICU. I even moisturised her arms and legs so her scars would heal properly because nobody was doing it for her. I’m so heart broken. I want to die. I feel invisible and I don’t know where to put my pain. I have nobody because it’s too heavy for anyone to deal with, and all our mutual friends just want to focus on the positives that she is recovering which I understand but it’s like they don’t understand that she hung herself. I’m traumatised for life, and her life is changed for ever even if she does make a full recovery which who knows—she’s still very brain damaged and doesn’t even know what’s happened to Her. I have never posted before, I don’t know anyone who’s had any kind of similar experience. It’s so layered and I have a 11 year history of self harm and drug use, both of which I had recovered from, years since I have self harmed and 3 months since I have used drugs or alcohol, but all I want to do is hurt myself in anyway I can.

Edit: she had hung herself on the back of her door, so by opening her bedroom door that’s how she was released from hanging. I called 000 immediately as I untied the belt from her neck and checked if she was breathing or had a heart beat. All I did was find her and untie her and try wake her up realise she was very obviously dead/not conscious and call 000 and then do what they told me to until anyone arrived because I was in so much shock I was just doing what they were telling me to, even when the woman was like you need to somehow get into that room and I had to kick her desk back and squeeze my way into her bedroom I had no idea why the woman was saying she needed to be laid out flat on her back until all of a sudden the woman was telling me to give her mouth to mouth then I realised I was about to do CPR. I was screaming and crying why are you making me do this she’s dead the entire time and the woman just kept saying I know *my name* but just keep helping her until help gets there.

22,I want to kill myself. I want to die. NSFW,"**trigger warning - talk of sexual and physical abuse.There is no TL DR, I need to vent. I've never told anyone the entirety of my life. I never wrote down how I felt. I want to see if it helps.**

&#x200B;

I was physically abused by my father. I remember one time he slammed/pushed the kitchen table into my chest while I was eating dinner. It pressed my chair up against the wall, then pushed all the air out of my chest. I remember getting tunnel vision and hitting the floor limp, as the table was pulled away.

When I tried to get up, while on hands and knees, I was kicked in my stomach by him. I don't remember anything other than being on the couch and my mom leaving him after that with me and my 2 brothers. I was 8. This is ONE story.

&#x200B;

My great grandfather used to call me worthless and emotionally abuse me because of my ethnicity. Until I was in my 20's I was reminded daily about how worthless I was over something I had no control over. He basically stepped in as the father figure. I would spend my summers in Southern California helping him super his apartments until I was about 17.

&#x200B;

I have never told anyone this, I was also sexual abused.

&#x200B;

I have never told anyone this, I was raped.

&#x200B;

To me, those are two separate things. When the abuse started, I physically enjoyed it. Had no idea. Then I was brutally sodomized. Then I grew up just a little and that's when I started to hate distrust and not like anyone. I built a fake smile. I built an auto pilot response for everyday things. I don't think. When I can, I do what I can to stop.

&#x200B;

From the ages of 9, to about 14 I was fucking raped weekly by a boy 7 years older(We'll call the fat ugly rapist FMC). I felt like shit because at the start I liked it. I didn't know what was happening to me, I just felt. By the time I was 12, I started to feel disgusted. By 14, I fucking hated everyone. I don't care to discuss the last time he abused me but I will say I don't think he EVER put himself in the position he was in. He left me alone at that point.

By the time I was 18, I was wrapping up making money by taking it from adults to beat the shit out of under age people I went to school with (gang related and they didn't want to get in trouble, and hell whats the worst that could happen to me if I get caught? I was a minor), they all deserved \*this is just how I felt at the time\* it and it was my only outlet. It was shit like, kids stealing and the owners wanting revenge cause a family member seen them with the stolen property at school. Or someones dad wanted me to scare the shit out of the daughters boyfriend. Shit like like that. The last time I did something like this for example - Some kid who was a senior ( over 18 at the time )had his stereo stolen. He gave me $50 to beat the shit out of the kid who did it ( 16yo ). He reminded me of the boy who raped me. When I punched that kid, all I could see was that fat piece of shit FMC. When he was on the ground, in the fencing position, I drug and slammed him around by is hair. Into the side walk. I picked him off the ground, while he was dead weight- and rubbed his head in the top of a chain link fence. I was expelled and arrested for assault. I tested out of High school. I have never ever been violent with ANYONE since then. All the way till now and I'm 36.

During my time in School, seventh through high school, I hated everyone. Fuck em. I had only 1 real friend and I had one crush on a girl. One. It lasted no less than 2 weeks of fantasizing before FMC learned about it. He didn't like it. He told David my best friend at the time (he had no idea FMC was fucking raping me and new him as a friend of my family) that I had made out with her. He knew David liked her. David, pissed from hearing this, asked Christian. Of course she denied it. It never happened, it wasn't true. I was now known as a Liar. She went to church and school with me. I was 13 at the time, so from grade school right on through to high school, if I went to church with you or school, I was a liar. So the one girl I've ever liked now labeled me and to everyone else a liar. My best friend, no longer, because now I'm a liar. This was what happened the first time I ever told another person I had FEELINGS twards someone else. One little bitty crush. Now - No social life. Destroyed. Home life also. Behind the scenes is a literal fucking hell. I liked girls. was being raped by a 300lb+ fat fucking boy. I hated FMC, after my last altercation with him I was close to or at 15. About a year goes by. No girls look at me. Small town. I don't like them, because they hate me, I lie about making out with em. I wanted to have sex though. To be clear, I wanted to fuck. I had been fucked. I wanted to have joy... Just once... So I had a plan. When I was around 16, doing the summer Super Job for my Grandfather, I paid a prostitute for my first sexual encounter that mattered because I wanted to know what sex was like with a woman. When I got back to Northern California after the summer job at gramps, I told my older brother and he called me a liar. I never told him anything personal up until recently because of that. now my family thinks I'm a liar, and hates me to.

&#x200B;

So at this point I am 18 and I fucking hate everyone. My dad also starts developing a mental disorder. He slowly is becoming mentally disabled. I figured, fuck him. Some karma.

&#x200B;

I decide to move out. My cousin, she moves in with me. I was growing weed at the time. Played video games. Didn't think.

She and I connected. She was the first person I ever felt ANY affection for. She didn't want to use me. She didn't want hurt me. She wanted to know why I was hurt. My head at this point of my life is just so fucked I think/confuse that with her romantically liking me. I did my best to sleep with her. She out of guilt, w/e let me. She knew nothing about my past for the most part and we did not grow up together.

I knew her from the age of 1-5, then met her again when she was 17. I, out of the fucked up need to want to be wanted by the ONLY person I actually had confused feelings for manipulated or talked or w/e my cousin into an incestuous relationship. I wanted to kill myself. I kicked her out of the apt. She moved in with my older brother and had a sexual relationship with him for about 3 years. I felt I was the one that fucked her in the head enough to do that.

&#x200B;

I was going to kill myself.

&#x200B;

My grandmother, the great grandfathers daughter had bad arthritis. She was a chef. So I learned to cook and take care of her. I learned that I enjoyed people eating and liking my cooking. This was the first time I felt ANY joy from someone else. People. My grandmother died when I was around 26. she killed her self, the pain was to much. I hate saying this but, I didn't really care. I love her... but I didn't care. At least she wasn't in pain....

&#x200B;

I felt nothing for anyone for a good period of time. No love, no hate.

&#x200B;

So until about the age of 27, I got hit on multiple times. I am not unattractive I guess. I was in 8 physical relationships in my twenties. 2 I sorta developed feelings for. I never asked any of them out. I never once told them I loved them. I never lied to them or cheated. They asked me out, they persude me.  Sex was a chore. I love sex in my head. I love to  masturbate . Watch a healthy amount of porn. But actually having sex..... ugh, I would rather  masturbate  tbh. Everything sex reminded me of two things, the only person I care for and still love like a sister now, my cousin; which makes me sick to my stomach because I felt I manipulated her into doing something horrible, and being raped in the ass by a big fat piece of shit.

With porn at least I can choose any nice loving thing that I want. I like scenes where you can tell there really into each other...  And I don't have to think.

\`

At 28 I was in love for the first time.  Met her at work.

&#x200B;

She started everything. I mean EVERYTHING. She broke up with her boyfriend AT work. Asked me out in front of him the next week. For 6 months she was in a relationship with me, for 6 months I thought we were together. For 6 months her and her old boyfriend who she was in a relationship with for more than 5 years at this point, used me to further his cuckold fantasy. When I found him literally in the closet one night in MY FUCKING APARTMENT that she snuck him into that day at what time I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, jacking off to me fucking his girlfriend who I thought was with me, I flipped out. My life is insane, WTF IS THIS SHIT. Melony thought I was going to kill them. I might've. She left, both naked, with my blanket, peeling out of the parking lot. I quit that job the next day.

&#x200B;

I want to kill myself. Have it planned.

&#x200B;

My father develops a bad health issue, compounded with his now mental age of around 7, his health his slipping. fast.

&#x200B;

I move in with him, the state pays for me to take care of him. I do nothing but play video games and smoke weed. I'm waiting. I tell myself, ""When he dies. I go to.""

&#x200B;

At 31, I leave the house maybe once a month. My older brother decides he wants to reach out cause I'm a ""little"" closed off. At the age of 32 He includes me in his hobby. At 34, I turned it into what might now be a carrier. I still take care of my father. I am not so sad anymore.

&#x200B;

I'm 36, I'm doing well at the job I can make into a career. I met someone. Another Co worker. And for the first time, no confusion, I have a full blown crush as an adult. She's nothing special to look at. Not ugly in any way. But my god the personality, her choice in music, so many things in common. Thinking about her makes me smile. She initiated the flirting. We chatted for hours and hours for weeks. This did not happen over night. She has been there for 7 months at this point, and about 2 attached at my hip when she had free time. Also the subjects she would bring up. She was very much flirting. So of course I tell her. No way can I have any regrets.

&#x200B;

So today I come into work and she makes no eye contact and shuts her office door. Witch is not normal. I ask her if I can talk to her about something later at lunch. We get ice cream some times together so I figured that would be the time. She just avoided and left me standing there after I asked if we could talk later. Didn't answer. So I asked her at the end of the day. Told her how I felt, and the last thing that I wanted was for her to feel weird at work.  Then she told me she has some one, and it's ""complicated"". I am almost positive, she likes another coworker. I see them text each other all the time. Didn't think anything of it till today. The thing is, yesterday I mentioned I might ask her out the next day joking around when I seen the other co worker in the parking lot, the one I think she likes. He doesn't work in the building with us. Hadn't seen or talked to him at all today. He Laughed when he seen me today at the end of the day when we clocked out. Pretty sure he told her the day before, it made so much sense after I thought about it. The way she avoided me.

&#x200B;

She wants nothing to do with me. Went from conversations, her staring at me when she thought I wasn't looking, to her actively avoiding me at work. In just one day. I went from feeling again. I went from finally feeling like I can open up to someone. I even entertained being normal once. I felt again for someone else ONCE MORE. This time it wasn't misplaced I told myself. I should have listened to myself when I told me not to even think like that. because it wont happen. It won't. Never in my life will I ever find someone that wants me for me, not to use me. Never in my life will I want the person that does. I will not be happy.

All I want for my coworker is to be happy. I don't think in any way that anything on both parts was malicious. I think it's just terrible timing. Or this is hell.

&#x200B;

I think I'm done. Thinking about headed to sleep.  I will check tomorrow to see what people have to say if anything... All I know is, I got to feel for once, and what I felt was what people do normally. I couldn't even once in my life have one thing ONE fucking thing normal. I can't be happy I guess. Fuck this world.

UPDATE- I made it home from work. While I was at work I felt comfortable enough to talk a LITTLE to a co - worker. Gave him a little perspective and the day was less award than I thought it would be. he helped just by listening. That being said, she still locked herself in her office all day so there was at least not to much awkwardness. Didn't have lunch with everyone witch is very unusual for me and left a little early so we didn't have to leave together. I just want her to feel comfortable at work. It's not her fault at all. Also everyone at work knows. Everyone including both my bosses thought the same as I did about my co-workers interest in me. One even asked the girl I liked I guess, ""how long do you think it will take before you two hook up?"". So I guess my mind wasn't playing tricks on me. Just wish she didn't play games. All I know is I can't choose how I feel and I bet she's no different. So I am just going to be myself for right now. Do what I do. Don't think, just do. But fuck, I'm still so fucking tired of being nothing, feeling nothing. At least today I felt like shit =) I mean, that at least is something...

26,Anyone else badly want a relationship but know it’s a terrible idea,"How could having a relationship be a good idea when most of us on this thread are probably really unstable, some getting their thoughts out, some contemplating ending it, some already having decided and making their last remarks.

I don’t think life has a meaning but I do think love is the closest thing that means the slightest to me. The only times in the last 3 years I see shimmer of light is when a potential romantic interest arises. The feelings are different to those of friends of family for me. Selfish to want it or engage when you sleep for 16 hours some days, don’t respond to meds and are very unstable. One day having made plans to end your life, the nest cancelling them. Being paralysed in bed another day. All those sorts of things make relationships unattainable and daunting for people like us.

So unfair and angering. Everyone deserves love, especially those who are suffering and suicidal. I feel we deserve it the most but we can’t feel it like other people because our mind is torturing us and convincing us we don’t deserve it. I’ve turned down girls for poor and unresponsive multiple mental illnesses. Will continue to do so until my health is stable which is as likely as me winning the lottery.

27,Casually suicidal?,"I would love for things to stop. Time to hold still and so slowly fade. Suicide will never be that peaceful.
I think abt death often. I don't necessarily have plans for life. I'm just patiently waiting for death. Like at a bus stop. I might read a book to pass time but my destination is so peaceful I can't help but to want to go there. 
I'm constantly afraid. Of everything. Feeling silence would be amazing

Point of this? Idk I never told anyone this cus they would worry but I feel like i need to. Don't worry tho~ most likely I won't be taking an active role. I've desired death even stronger than now and I've been too afraid. So.

Edit : thanks for the comments. Its nice knowing I'm not alone. If anyone would like advice since I'm just ""waiting at my bus stop"" doing what I can enjoy has been a great way to spend time.

29,I want to die but afraid of dying!!!,"Death. Death. Death. That is all I can think of right now. However, I am scared of dying. The thought of the hereafter scares me to death. What will happen to me after committing suicide? I keep asking myself this question whenever I think of suicide. I also ask myself these questions: how will my loved ones react to my death? What if in the final moments I regret my choice? Will it be painful? And finally: what awaits me after death?

As a religious person, it is not fun at all. Suffering in this world and the hereafter does not sound fair. I just want to end it all without burning in fire for eternity. But I am sure the fire will be my punishment if I were to commit suicide. But at the same time, I am suffering in this world. So really it all comes down to what is worse. I choose suffering here.

But at the same time not. I want to end it all. The shame, the struggle, the pain. Everything in this world I hate. There is nothing stopping me from ending my life other than the hellfire. Not even my loved ones. And I do not even feel selfish writing this. I am being honest.

Someday I am sure suicide will be my only option. Then the fear of hellfire will be gone. Even if it is not gone, I will be so lost and sad, losing my faith, and then I will commit suicide. I cannot wait for that day to come. I will then slice my throat open and, finally, put an end to all my suffering. Or, on the other hand, start a journey full of great suffering. As you can tell, I am contradicting myself all the time. That is because I am lost. And very sad.

Sure not as shitty as some others have it, but it's all shitty. I was never meant to find someone to be happy with or anything like that, I was always meant to die alone. I tried to avoid it but by 30 it became clear the path I was going down.

More importantly, I just never was happy with myself or life in general. Losing loved ones, losing touch with friends and never making new ones, being bored with the work I chose but having no interest in going back to school. Life is just not worth it to me. Lots of suffering and sadness with not much upside. I said if I wasn't feeling better by 31 I'd end it, and here I am. I'll miss my family but I'm done ""being strong for others."" Time to take care of myself.

I chose a method that is very lethal and should go quick. Yeah I know ""you might screw up"" but oh well, that's a risk I'll take. Oh and I'm sure someone will show up to tell me I'll go to hell like they always do to people here, and yeah, I'm shaking in my boots ;) lol.

1,I just saw a post asking “If you committed suicide a year ago what beautiful things would you have missed?”. I can’t think of a single thing.,"When I saw that post it stopped my mindless scrolling instantly. I have been thinking for almost half an hour now with no luck. Even if I think of the year before that. Although I have been suicidal in the past with many attempts, that was so long ago and I didn’t realize I still felt this way deep down. 

This last year has been be laying in bed day after day other than the few times a week I go downtown and waste my whole cheque on heroin. I guess I haven’t felt like dying because I’ve been so focused on being high. My mom refuses to let me outdoors alone for more than 5 minutes because she can’t trust me to not go downtown and pick up.

I considered finally dating my best friend of 4 years as a thing I would have missed happening, but if I’m honest, things don’t feel the same as they did when we were best friends. I do love him, but now after years of him being clean he’s relapsed. It’s only been a week and he has already ended up in the hospital. He’s one of the 4 people in my life that I actually talk to. The other 3 are my family members.

My dad is across the country with his girlfriend and we rarely talk even though he reaches out. It’s the first year ever that he has not gifted me something for Christmas or my Birthday, which are only a week apart, and it made me terribly depressed sitting at home with his gifts never opened and now stored away in my closet with all the other junk that doesn’t matter. I know my mom is disappointed in me and so is my grandmother who, the same as my dad, I can’t seem to get myself to call back or message. I have no friends. I am alone and broke and unhappy.

This all came out of nowhere. I don’t know what to do. I have been trying so hard to get in touch with a psychiatrist but my office just ignores me and I’ve already called and gone there begging over 15 times in the last 4 months. There is too many things wrong and I can’t solve them all. Every time I told my mom about being suicidal in the past she would get angry and call me selfish, so family is off the list of people I can talk to since they tell my mom everything. My boyfriend interrupts me when I tell him I’m depressed and goes on about his own feelings, so he’s off the list too.

My mother won’t let me leave the house alone at all either, so I can’t get away from her unless I want to leave for good. If I do leave, she will kick me out and not let me back inside, which would force me to stay god knows where. I know that is illegal since I pay rent and sounds crazy but it is only because she fears I will run downtown and pick up heroin. 

Unfortunately, all that is on my mind is getting high. If I do, I’ve got no home unless I go to treatment and there are no options for that currently with this virus that I can think of. Even if there was, I can’t commit. Ironically, drugs are probably the main reason I’m not dead yet and why I’ve been so distracted from realizing I was still suicidal.

I’m feeling a million emotions a minute and I have nothing to stop me from making the “wrong” choice. I’m sorry this story is so long, I just want to be as detailed as I can so if I do end it, I’ve left at least something behind. Everything else is dirty and messy and worthless. I feel that I deserve to end things after all the rape and abuse and hatred I’ve had to deal with in my life. I REFUSE to believe it is a selfish thing to do anymore.

3,I’m a Nurse who killed people,"I can’t shake the guilt. I caught covid from a patient in the hospital I work at full time. I work at a nursing home per diem, and went there while I had a slight cough. The day after I worked there I was incredibly sick, and found out my patient at the hospital had tested positive and moved to a ventilator in the ICU. They eventually died and were the first death in my state from the virus. Right now 30 people in the nursing home are positive with covid.

I just graduated from nursing school a few months ago. I have no paid time off, and the three weeks I was out with covid made me have to empty my savings and use my credit just to pay the bills.

Mentally I’m not ok. I don’t think I am coping well. I drink too much. I have been watching suicide videos and been jealous of their courage to go through with it. 

I feel so good when I work in the hospital. But then I’m isolated in my apartment by myself. My girlfriend of five years broke up with me while I was sick with the virus. She had been in PA school in a differed state and has started talking to another guy. 

I just don’t feel good. I cope with alcohol. I have no other outlets. I have scheduled myself to work 50+ this week just so I am not alone in my bed.

Honestly, I feel like I have been screwed. I was on the frontlines treating this disease before PPE and isolation measures were in place. Now work three weeks off after getting sick I can barely keep with the bills. 

I just want to sleep. I sleep all day, because when I sleep I don’t hurt or think about those I have killed. As a new nurse I don’t think I’m prepared mentally for isolation and tragedy.

Edit: Thanks everyone for your kind words. I’m still hurt, but I’m coping. I started reaching out to people. I am going into a program to stop drinking so much. I am safe.

4,I'm a pedophile and I think I'm ready to kill myself,"I've never had a normal sex drive and I thought I was asexual for a while, but I guess the reality is more insidious. I've struggled with Pure O OCD ever since I was a child, and at first I thought this was it. I've always worried about hurting people. My sexuality has been an topic of anxiety since grade school, since I have been borderline asexual my whole life. Late high school was when it began, although I was never able to accept it then. It hit like a truck last summer where I had multiple panic attacks due to these thoughts that put me in a mental hospital. I hoped the drugs they gave me would help end the fetish, but they only helped the anxiety and depression. It has been getting steadily worse ever since. Most therapists understandably don't want to see me. Yesterday I masturbated to an anime child (thankfully I have never looked up illegal images). I think at this point it hit what I had become and I lost hope for redemption. I am a ticking time bomb before I ruin someones life. And I can't live with myself like this. I can never have a SO, or a family. Even having friends feels wrong. It's going to be be hard as I actually enjoy my life quite a bit. But I feel like this is the only responsible and logical thing to do. End it now while I'm still me, before this takes over. From now on I plan to stop taking my meds, as the mood swings will help me get this done. Then end by exit bag or hanging while listening to Avril 14th. I am tired of the self pity and ready to take responsibility. Wish me the luck and courage to end this. Thank you.

9,I want to kill myself to avoid the future,"Generally speaking, my life isn’t terrible right now. But I know the future is going to be unimaginably painful and it scares the crap out of me. So much so that I’m willing to end it all to avoid it. 

Maybe I’m just overreacting, since what I’m scared of is what pretty much everyone goes through. But I really don’t want responsibility. I hate that the more I age, the more people expect of me. I don’t want to turn 18 and suddenly be an adult, thrown out to the world. There’s so much that will have to be done in my life and I can’t handle it.

11,I tried to kill myself but survived and no one knows,"January  8th 2020 I was driving home listening to Amy Winehouse and decided that this was my time. It was on a windy, empty country road, late at night, in torrential rain- accidents happened there all the time. I had just finished having dinner with my housemate at University and was on my way to my hometown to see my family. No one would suspect a thing. I closed my eyes, let go of the steering wheel and put my foot down. 

When I opened my eyes my vision was blurred, but I could see that my windshield had caved in. I proceeded to crawl out across the passenger seat, opening the door with my elbow as hands were covered in shards of glass. There was no shock, no confusion. I felt a small sense of relief that I wasn’t paralysed, and a bigger sense of relief that I hadn‘t hit anyone else. But other than that, I still felt just as dead inside as I had prior to the crash.

I went through the motions. Strangers came to my aid, followed shortly by the paramedics and later my parents. I laughed and smiled through it, cracking jokes about ordering my preferred cocktail of pain relief and apologising for keeping everyone up so late. I had just survived a near fatal car crash and already the guilt and shame of everyone worrying about me was kicking in.

I had aquaplaned across the road, accelerating into a hedge, before flipping my 2004 corsa four times, knocking down a row of silver birches in the process and spinning 20m down the country lane. I had landed upright but the roof of the car had moulded around my headrest. I’m only 5’2”, if I was a couple of inches taller my head would have been caved in. I should have been dead. 

Instead, I spent a week in hospital lying on my back, completely immobilised, awaiting my C7 spinal surgery. Post-surgery, my doctor told me he’d seen MRI scans like mine where the patient had already been paralysed, so I guess the fact that I walked out of hospital after 9 days with Just a neck brace was a silver lining. 

Since then I‘ve carried on keeping up appearances. Things have changed, some for the better, some for the worse. For a while, my frustration that I had survived was outweighed by my relief that I wasn’t paralysed, and in truth that is still the case. But my fear of putting my family through something like that again is starting to wear off. It‘s a constant fight between my happiness and their grief. What’s more important? Should I continue to suffer silently in a world where I feel completely lost and alone, just to postpone their mourning for what will eventually happen anyway?",fvd2oi,724,0.99,67,2020-04-05 12:31:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fvd2oi/i_tried_to_kill_myself_but_survived_and_no_one/,False,False,2020,4

13,"No one really cares, they're only trying to make themselves feel good.","A while back I removed myself from the contacts of my 'friends,' trying to isolate myself before I stepped in front of a bus. No one spoke to me, ever reached out. I had to initiate every conversation, I was the runt hanging around that no one had the balls to formally tell to fuck off. Of course, the moment I do leave, everyone suddenly cares, everyone is buzzing my phone asking what's up and how I'm doing, they even got a hold of my parents. It escalated at some point to where the only one from that group I had any respect for is on the phone pleading that I don't die, that suicide is irrational and that I should consider meds.

Guess what, I said sure, I won't die, I'll go back business as usual. And you know what, it is business as usual. I am never anyone's first choice, I haven't spoken to another human in over a month.

I must really be repulsive when I offend people whom i don't even know.

Noone would read my suicide note. I don't have a single friend. At 30 years of age I have never been in a relationship. I have no family. Who would read this? 

I've written a suicide note every week for 10 years. But I just can't seem to end myself. I wish I could absorb the illnesses of my patients, like a superpower that lets them go home to their families and lets me die. Maybe I would be remembered as a hero.

I wish someone would read my note. But noone will. I have another meeting with corona in a few hours.

17,the amount of people suffering here is insane,"do you sometimes realize that the amount of people suffering from severe depression and on the brink of killing themselves on this subreddit and outside of this subreddit really speaks the painful truth about our socaity and our world in general? the world we live in ladies and gentlemen are crule uncaring and cold
in this socaity we view the mentaly ill as an outcast an alien a very disgusting and unacceptable creature....which we pretend to care about and try to ""help"" them
if you suffer from cancer or any other illness people can actually acknowledge your pain and know you are suffering
they know how hug your scars are
but with mental illness people sometimes understemate your suffering
people understemate how severe your depression actually is
people say go get therapy, take anti depressiants but its not a 100% cure it never cured everyone((i myself took pills but it never worked))
actually depression and other disorders
never had a magical cure like we have on flu...yet we dont take it seriously 
and the result? suicide

i really wish depression was like a flu it could get away with some medicine
but no ...its like a curse...once you get it
its gonna never stop hurting you
only if its not too late and only if you got some huge will to live you maybe can get through it ...maybe
its like a snake ...eats you from the inside out
first it eats your will to live and then it eats your ability to enjoy things 
and finally when it really completely took over your mind and body ...it will make you wish for death and later on plan it
this snake feeds on neglect truamatizing events
and deep scars left unhealed...and we can only destroy this cursed snake with care , love and good treatment
not risk truamatize suicidal people with more shit...i swear people could never understand us and only the ones who suffer like us can only understand what if really feels like to have this shitty disorder...
if only people could at least show a bit of understand and care
we would'nt ever get to this point
that idea really makes me hate humanity and myself even more...everything bad happens to us is what we deserve 
we all cold and greedy
we all just take take and take
we never give
we never gave to eachother nor to this poor plant
we all deserve to die 
no one is good
if there is good left in us its only minor
god if you even exist please end us already
please end me...i dont want to see myself living inside this hell forever
the hell is in me and in the world
i can never fix myself nor i can fix the fucked up world
the best i could do is just die

edit : one day and this many upvotes? well i gusse there are a lot of people who get me , wow im not completely misunderstood for being a sick fuck!

18,I don’t want to live without him,It’s been 8 years since my fiancé was murdered in a robbery gone bad and I wish I could say I’m better but I’m not. I’ve hated my life every moment of every day since he left. I hate this world for taking him from me over something so stupid. I was born to a family that doesn’t love me and everyone has treated me like shit except him and now I have to live the rest of my miserable life without him. I’ve prayed for the courage to end it all. I’ve tried every single antidepressant available and it only makes things worse. The worst is discussing it with others because they always try to force me to date someone else and move on but I don’t want anyone else. The thought of being with someone else makes me feel sick. I’m not over my fiancé and I never will be. I think I was pregnant by him around the time he died but miscarried due to stress. I don’t want to live with this pain anymore. I’m never going to love someone like that or be loved like that again. I will never marry or have a family. I will never watch my kids graduate high school or meet my grandchildren.

19,Please read this if you have the time.,"I'm really hoping somebody sees this, even if that seems selfish.

Maybe this isn't the right place for this. I'm new to this whole Reddit thing, so I was pretty shocked when I found this subreddit. the world is pretty crazy these days, I guess. I have no clue how many people will see this, or if anyone will see it, but I just need a place to vent. So, here's a not-so-short summary of my entire life story.

I was born at a very young age in Korea to a woman and a man (who already had another child, my sister) in a crippling amount of debt. I moved to Canada after a couple of years of living in Korea, my father's irresponsible investments and petty crime following us from across the globe.

I was four when my mother hit me for the first time. I don't remember the particular instance, but it was then for sure. To me, it seemed as if my mother would go out of her way to hit me whenever the opportunity arose. ANY opportunity at all. She would beat me senseless for not cleaning my room or eating too slow, or whatever other trivial matter she felt like punishing me for. There have been far too many instances in my life so far, where I, an innocent child, has cowered at the hands of her mother, thinking it was the end. She has made me fear for my life on numerous accounts.

I was in the third grade when I called my mom a bitch for the first and last time. I just remember being so insanely frustrated with the way she treated me, and the way she was so much more accepting and lax when it came to disciplining my older sister. I muttered it with seething anger on my way out the door that day. She called the school I was attending at the time and told them I was ""sick"". She kept me home and beat me with a metal music stand, aiming for my head, my throat, and just about anywhere else she figured she could land a blow. This went on until my barely present father came home from work. I was sent to school the next day, being given a kiss before I left as if the day before had never happened.

My school performance was never awful. in fact, it was more the opposite. I was considered somewhat of a child prodigy. School was the one place I felt I could truly thrive, if ever. I did have what I would consider seriously awful behaviour in school, as I would lash out at other children with the same violent tendencies as my mother. This was not brought to anybody's attention, so for a very long time, which means it was not corrected until much later in my life.

The (abusive?) cycle kept going the way it was, with her beating the shit out of me for the sake of discipline, and then acting if she was some sort of saint the very next day, with not even a hint of guilt or remorse on her face. I remember being in the fourth grade, sick of being ""disciplined"". I picked up our landline and looked her in the eye,

""I'm going to call the police and tell them everything you do to me."" And she said,""Go ahead, nobody is going to help you."" I felt completely defeated. There was no help for me. There was no escape. Even at the tender age of 9, I started to feel as if there was no escape but death. I felt as if I couldn't talk to anyone about this. 'Mom would probably hit me again.' 'Dad is never home.' ' I know she wouldn't get it.' I knew that if I talked about it at school, that legal troubles were sure to ensue, so I kept my mouth shut for a long time.

Another memorable instance happened in the fifth grade, when my mother fell insanely ill out of nowhere. we were at the pool. She seemed to be completely fine just moments before, but now she was seemingly dying in a changing stall, telling me to get her help over and over again. And I didn't. Call me a heathen. I stood right in front of the stall door and prayed with all my heart and soul that she would just die and leave me alone. She didn't. Some days I still wish that she did.

Fast forward just a little more. There I was, a tender 11, resentful and bitter at the world. I didn't give a shit about anything. I just wanted it to be over. My school performance started to slip, I just couldn't understand like I could before. Anything and Everything was insanely distracting, and I took to watching anime and gameplay videos as a means of escape from the world. Somehow, my hungover teacher would still find any excuse to give me a good mark, and I was still considered a prodigy, despite my near fail scores. I couldn't do math to save my life, but because of the way I was treated, I would chant to myself 'at least I'm smart' to make me feel better about it all. I was accepted into an academic challenge program for junior high, which only further inflated my ego.

When I got to my brand new school, I realized a couple of things: 1. Years of being violent towards my peers left me completely unapproachable. 2. I had extreme trust issues. 3. I was fucking stupid compared to my peers. I so badly wanted junior high to be my break, my way out. I wanted so badly for everything to get better. But I couldn't make any new friends (probably because I was terrifying, we're talking descriptive death threats left and right) and my academics were not improving at all. Focusing was near impossible. I couldn't ever shut my mouth. Everyone hated me. I was at an all time low, and I still didn't have a single soul to tell this to. I couldn't trust those kids at school, they'd hand me over to the police like I was nothing. I never wanted that. I desperately wanted to put my past behind me. My mom had stopped beating me (only after figuring that her multiple illnesses made her weaker than I was) but it still felt as if she would strike again at any moment. I was living on edge at home and school. I managed to raise myself a little, teaching myself to trust little by little. Teaching myself what was morally acceptable. Anything to make me even one friend.

Eighth grade was somewhat of a breeze. I had friends, and people seemed to no longer think I was terrifying. But of course, in a cruel world such as this, nothing can ever be completely good. my grades were slipping hard. I procrastinated to the end of my life, and every assignment I handed in was complete shit. Things didn't really improve family wise either. My mom would be pissed at me if I was sick and bedridden, since that's an inconvenience to her. My dad was drunk every single day and my sister was starting to become a second mother. Definitely not ideal, but I would fight my way through it. look at what I had already overcome!

Ninth grade. shit. I realized that people didn't actually like me. To everyone, I was just a background character, nothing more than a forgettable nobody. I felt invisible, like I was talking and people just didn't even care that I was there. This is also the year I was diagnosed with ADHD. Family didn't take it well, or rather they just didn't take it. None of them have really bothered to look into ADHD at all, nobody asked the doctor any questions, none. Zip. Nada. My parents don't give a damn. They've made no means to learn about it. They just pump me full of what's essentially meth as medication and hope I shut the fuck up. They don't reprimand my older sister calling me retarded at any given chance. Nothing. It's awful knowing that because of this, I'll never be normal. Nevertheless, I kept working towards self improvement. I was making good progress. I really thought I had a shot at getting better and fully escaping my past-

nope. quarantine. I'm stuck at home with my family. My mom has definitely calmed down, but I know that deep down she resents me. Now, my sister is my biggest enemy. She truly is my second mother. She belittles me constantly, insulting me and disregarding me. Worst of all, she pretends she's a fucking saint, just like my mother. When I confront her about the things she does, all I get is a

""No I don't, I don't have any idea what you're talking about!"" And then she just keeps on hanging around in my room pretending like we're best friends, as if she didn't call me a defective retard the other day.

And here I am now, washed up at 14, unable to recover from my past. Broken forever. Defective. Stupid. Unmotivated. Invisible to the world. I want to end it all. I have nothing to lose. I am nothing. I purposefully omitted my current age until the end of the post because I didn't want people to think I was a ""sad girl"" or just a typical teenager. The more I read this though, the more I'm starting to think I am just stupid teenager who needs to be disregarded. My feelings are invalid. I hate myself.

If anyone is really out here, and I'm not completely invisible, please say something. I don't want to be alone anymore. I don't think I can do this anymore. I don't want to be alone anymore.

1,"The logistics of killing yourself are so endlessly, frustratingly complicated","I would literally attempt suicide right now if I thought it would work, but I just feel like I would just end up with permanent damage and be accused of being an attention seeker, when in reality, I just want to die quietly without any fuss. 

I hate hearing stuff like, *""if you fail, it's just a parasuicidal gesture""* and *""there are lots of ways to make sure it works,""* because sure-fire suicide methods are obviously not readily available to the vast majority of people. 

* Do I try to poison myself with household products and probably just end up screwing up my organs?
* Do I try to hang myself and risk brain damage? 
* Do I jump off a tall building and freak out a bunch of people who don't deserve it?
* Do I kill myself in the bath/pool and make everyone else feel weird about using it afterwards?
* Do I lie to get a prescription I don't actually need and potentially get someone in trouble?
* Do I gas myself and put others in harm's way?
* If I write a note, would that comfort people, or would it just make them feel like they could've ""done something"" and make it worse?
* Should I ghost my friends before I do it to minimise the casualties? 
* Is it better for my family/friends to find me, or some rando?
* What place/time would be best to prevent me from being interrupted?
* Should I endure the pain and wait until I'm a bit older to kill myself so that I'm not seen as some immature, self-centred kid and people in my life don't blame themselves?
* If I survive, do I lie and say it was impulsive, and not like, years in the making?
* Should I delete my SNS pages and all the messages that I can before doing it?
* Should I try between semesters in case I fail and need to take a break because I've messed up my health?
* Would me killing myself destroy my religious extended family? 
* Should I quit my job beforehand, or do I keep it just in case I survive?

There is no doubt in my mind that I'm going to do it, but I don't want to before I have a proper plan in place. Partly to minimise the damage, but mostly because I'm just so very worried about the consequences of potentially screwing up. I don't even question whether or not this is what I really want anymore, it's just a matter or how and when. 

I wish this self-righteous society didn't censor 99% of helpful information that'll actually let me die instead of end up sick and injured. I wish I didn't have to feel guilty or selfish for wanting this. I wish people would stop spewing their spiritual and philosophical ideologies at me when they have f\*ck all to do with my personal situation. I wish people would admit that it's possible and even sometimes reasonable to want to kill yourself but not be depressed. I wish people would stop changing their tune about whether or not this will get better or worse with age when it's convenient for them. I wish it wasn't so hard and so morally taboo and so painful and so contentious and so risky to choose what I do with my own freaking life that I never even wanted in the first place.",gk7spi,1159,0.99,79,2020-05-15 12:00:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gk7spi/the_logistics_of_killing_yourself_are_so/,False,False,2020,5
2,The hardest part of being suicidal,"The hardest part of being suicidal? At least for me (19 F), it's looking into the eyes of someone who loves you unconditionally and telling them that you're fine when you're having suicidal thoughts.

He has tolerated all my rage attacks, crying episodes, tantrums, and has spoiled and loved me ever since the day I was born. I suffer from bipolar 2 and have been going through a severe depressive episode which usually happens around the same time every year. This year I know exactly what's happening and I want to try my best to get past these thoughts. If not for me, for my dad. I have not known real pain until I saw his eyes water today when he saw me crying. He knows me and what I go through.

3,Wife cheated update,"Edit: So I've been getting a lot of DM's asking how I caught her etc and what I did. So I came back from a late night jog as I find it peaceful and relaxing as the streets are empty, I came back home to have a shower of course as I was sweaty as fuck. I entered the apartment and just headed to the bedroom and there is where I saw her with another man in bed. My god damn silk sheets tainted by them 😔😂, but yeah it's weird cause I thought I would lash out but I was unusually calm about it. I told the guy to leave and he was literally shitting himself and scrambling to pick up his belongings, like this guy is literally tripping everywhere. 

I think he was afraid as I was just very calm and he didn't expect it. Anyway I spoke to my wife asking how long it's been happening and she told me who he is etc, it's a childhood ""friend"". After that I went to the train station which is where the first post came in.

Edit 2: People are also asking how long we were together. So I met my loyal and faithful wife at 14 and we got married at 20. So in total that's 12 years of faithfulness from the amazing wife. 

Edit 3: Holy shit whoever gave the platinum thanks so much???

Edit 4: People are surprised that I'm over this so quick and I'm calm about it, I guess it's down to the fact I live by the rule that is ""the pains compulsory, sufferings optional""

So it's been about 10hours since I posted this and honestly thank you so much everyone for all the support and comments. 

I'm not going to lie when I posted the previous post I was at the train station just waiting to jump infront of one but as stupid as it sounds the comments honestly helped. 

I've now kicked my wife out of our apartment and the bed that she was sleeping with the guy in, I have now burnt. Which kinda sucks as it was a king sized bed with silk sheets and everything but I wouldn't have even been able to sleep in those cheat stained sheets now no matter how much I scrub them. 

It felt good tho to actually burn it cause it was letting things go, I've cleared out all the things that reminded me off her and basically smashed it up so kinda like smash therapy and it felt amazing. 

Her parents know that she cheated on me cause she tried to spin it that I cheated on her however we have cameras in our apartment and I just sent them the videos 🤷🏽‍♂️.

Now her family has pretty much disowned her which I feel like it may be a bit too much even though she is a shitty person but honestly I couldn't care less.

I'm free, feeling a bit shit but I know I'll be happier and honestly if it wasn't for you guys I probably wouldn't be here. 

Thank you so much everyone, especially the dude that was talking about pasta 😂",gtdvnt,1073,0.99,112,2020-05-30 12:57:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gtdvnt/wife_cheated_update/,False,False,2020,5
4,I’m sick and tired of nobody giving a fuck about how you feel unless you’re cutting yourself or want to kill yourself.,"Does anybody understand how incredibly selfish that is?? “Don’t do it there’s so much to live for” like what your sorry ass who doesn’t want me gone so that you’re not sad? Guess fucking what I don’t fucking care if you’re that selfish you deserve to be just as sad as I am. I’ve been suffering all my life and you don’t give a fuck but the SECOND I say I’m gonna kill myself NOW it matters. But if I shut up about wanting to die and just express about how hurt I am you have better things to do you don’t fucking care nobody fucking cares. “Don’t talk to me about suicide it makes me uncomfortable” oh so sorry need me to paint your nails too princess??

And like cutting doesn’t even give me any sort of nice relief it doesn’t do anything for me. Wanna know why I do it? To express how fucking bad I’m hurting because nobody gives a shit unless you cut yourself. People can be suffering WORSE and not cut themselves because it doesn’t do anything for them.

I’m tired of paying bills and I’m tired of living here. People keep saying that this is a free country and you can achieve anything that you want to. But how can you when everything is so hard. Nothing is free here everything has a price tag. Everything is not easy they make life a living hell. I feel so trapped I’m tired of it I want out.

7,My despicable legacy,"Today, as 25th may I've decided to kill myself. Not sure if it's because I've finally gathered enough confidence, or if it's because I finally understand things I didn't before. I do not seek help, however, attention would be nice, to be heard at least one time in my life; to finally show the world my most secret flaws, my archivements, the things I've accomplished, the bad memories, overall: to finally tell my despicable legacy. 

I feel invisible. 

I've been invisible my whole life. While never completely ignored, always felt invisible. 
I feel alone, even when I'm with the ones that are close to me; it is something I've been trying to stop for around 10 years, but finally give up.

At first, I was born as an accident, I've never been told that, nor made feel that way, but is clear that a mother who is 19, and a father who is 21, didn't exactly planned a child outside even a stable relation. 
I was lucky to be born in a somewhat rich family. I lived with my mother, her parents and my uncle until I was 5, then moved to a flat, with my mother and her new husband. 
From 0 to 4 life was decently good, I don't personally recall any bad experiences, but I was told recently from my grandmother that I would usually cry and reject being taken from my home to hers. I don't know why. 
My dad was poor by that time, he was still studying as a ecologist. He was present, to be fair, he was more present when I couldn't remember. 

From 5 to 12 I lived in the flat I mentioned early. I was there alone most of the day. Now I think, what kind of parent would leave a kid alone in a flat at the age of 5? Well, one that clearly didn't care enough. At 6 I joined school, the same monotous hell I assisted for 12 years. I never really fitted with the average person. I wasn't an outcast, or a creep, I had friends. They weren't good friends, but they were friends after all. We would normally go to each other houses and play together, watch movies, etc. 
I never did good in school, I barely did decent. Parents reacted in the only logical way they could think of, by beating me. Luckily my mother and dad broke up when I was around 3, so each of them went their way. 
My father never, ever hit me. He was a rational man who believed in dicipline through love, tho he never showed me love. 
Nothing particulary especial happened from the age of 6 to 12, besides being bullied by some classmates; leading me to bully the ones who were weaker than me, which I completely regret. 

At the age of 10 this odd feeling started in my chest, some kind of void? Some kind of sucking force that was draining my energy, my happiness and somehow, my willing to live. I didn't understand it. I had no idea why it was happening. Suddenly, the world was no more love painted. A great hatred towards this new enviorement grew in me. To see everyone as an enemy. Years later I understood that was when my depression began, my daily prison, the loneliness I feel every day; that was the starting point. 
At 12, I cannot recall what was in especific that made me cut, but something made me look for some kind of redemption in flagellation. I enjoyed it to some degree. I never did it to a serious level, and I stopped fairly quick, it only lasted for around 6 months. Months of carving my hatred and depression in my horrible body. 
I forgot to mention that I've been called, or been made feel ugly my whole life, untill today. So a natural doubt about myself, and my body arise, and it's been here with me since so long... 

At this point I'm a bit drunk. Getting everything ready for my departure, as I listen to There's no beauty left here, amazing album. 

Sadly I never got hug any significant another, let alone kiss. I never felt the love of someone else, never got to cuddle anyone, to trust, to love, to have sex with, to share my thoughts. I've always been by my own, I've always been alone. What saddens me the most, is that I've never been heard. I've always been ignored.

Invisible. That's what I've been feeling like for about 4 years. 

Everyone around me gets talked by others. Others interact with others, but not me. 
It covers many aspects, not only been talked but... I don't know how to explain it. I am a somewhat smart person, but sometimes I believe I'm really invisible? 
Sometimes I talk to people in real life, and they just ignore me? 
Philosophy has been an interesting topic for me, yet I cannot answer myself. If I'm ignored like that, am I even there? Was I part of a community? 

But this is about the good things I did, too. 
I joined the fire brigade. Had a good time there, it filled myself more than any other activity, I helped men, women and children. Tho it was never enough to bury the loneliness and emptiness I felt. 

I also rescued a kitty that was pregnant! I called her Mamou, she had 4 little kitties which I gifted to people I knew who would take good care of them. 

But it's been 2 years since I've been living on my own, Mamou died 3 weeks ago, which made me realize the futily of life. But overall, made something a bit more clear for me. It wasn't hatred what I felt for the world, but disappointment. We've come so far as a species. We have so much potential, but it's been wasted, and me myself I am guilty of this. I haven't done anything remarkable. 
I am disappointed at the selfishness, the antipathy, the greed, and the distancing of humans. 

For those reasons I am sorry for whoever will have to clean my body, or cremate it? I am sure my parents won't want a funeral for me. I mean, even less with whats going on with the world right now 

That leads me to my next point, betrayal, backstabbing and abandon. That's what some of my friends did to me. They ditched me out of their lives like a spent torch, like a used tissue. 
Sure, I did a mistake, I admit it. I did many mistakes. But looking at them in a objective way, is not much different of what our true nature is, in other words, I never did something worth abandoning your friend, and then getting them fired of their job.

Quarantine is fucked up, makes me realize that the little chances I had of meeting someone before, now are completely gone. Tho it hasn't been all bad, I got fit. I lost a lot of weight. I've read hundred of classic and cult books, same for music. 

Anyway, to the last point. The things I most regret in life? Probably not being more myself, that would have probably brought more pain, but it is uncertain. 
I regret never meeting and loving someone, it was harsh seeing everyone around me find someone, everyone but me. 

If you made it this far, I cannot properly explain how much I appreciate the time you dedicated reading this. This is more attention than all the one I've been given through my whole life. It felt really good to open up after so long

I am Tomás Renard, these are the last words I want to say before leaving this world, and venturing into the next one. If anyone is concerned, know I will leave happy that at least read this post.

13,I quit.,"I quit. 

I can’t do this anymore. The world has gone to shit. My life is a mess. I can’t keep going anymore. 

I have no career prospects. No skills. No savings. No real home. No hobbies. No friends. There’s nothing to do and nothing to live for anymore in my life. Nothing to plan or to hope for. I’m not going anywhere and I’m sick of pretending that one day, somehow my hard work will pay off, because it never does and it never will. Fuck it all. 

My partner is a fucking nightmare to be with and is totally self absorbed and unsupportive. And swings wildly between a neurotic stoner who looses it like a skittish racehorse incapable of negating basic daily life or totally callous and cold and removed. No in between. She completely sabotages EVERYTHING I try to do for myself because she’s to fucking lazy and content with living like shit to make a change in her own life and ruins any resemblance of order I try to make for myself. 

I hate my shitty life. I hate the cunts I have to sit on the phone and “play nice with” selling shit they don’t need all day while being screamed at day in day out for less than minimum wage. I am rejected from every “good” job filtered and processed by AI I and pretend I want just so I can have a basic rate of pay that is financially viable enough to live off or god forbid, save. I looked at my CV the other day and I might as well have said, “fuck me up the arse for money” and I would have had better offers. At least then I wouldn’t feel so bad when inevitable some faceless corporation comes to emotionally, physically and financially fist fuck me in the name of profit margins and wildly conflicting agendas. At least I wouldn’t be so fucking surprised.

Everyday of my life is just one big joke. I put one foot forward and it’s just straight into the next biggest pile of dog shit. Constantly wading through piles of the next worst day of my life to the next. Pretending like one day it will be better but one day never comes.

I’m ugly, I’m fat and unemployable and scratch a bare minimum of making do throughout it all. Everything I love fucks up in the end and I hate where it’s gotten me. The vapid swirling vortex of fuck all. The purgatory of wearing this fucking mask, pushing boulders, breaking my back, tearing my nerves to shreds by the handful. Grating my bones to brittle twigs for some fat lazy cunt to get rich off of who doesn’t even know I’m alive. 

Then there’s the fucking world going to fuckkery... Honestly tell me what the point would even be anymore if I carried on and if by some miracle should somehow be falling out of my ass, why bother? Pretty much everyone is dying of this fucking virus or moronically trying to spread it further with their woowoo fucking cunt faced conspiracy shit or out of sheer ignorance desperate to give one another a death sentence via coughing fit. Even if that should somehow be solved within the next 6-8 months, the worlds still fucked and passed the point of no return, waiting for the seas to boil the life out of them, the ice caps to melt, the animals to rot from inside out and the world to goatse itself into a complete inhospitable prolapsed wasteland or, at best to wander around crippled by its change and ravage with mask and life support donned, picking our way through the mess for scraps.

Fuck me, even if the world doesn’t fuck us up, the socio-economic buggery will be the equivalent of throwing a brick into the middle of a crowded bar fight. Police and totalitarianism on the horizon, double speak, riots, food shortages, poverty, fake news, social unrest, the slump of everyday life as we know it cracking its skull on the wall behind and dribbling from its mouth as it sinks to its fucking knees.

I don’t even feel good about having kids anymore... What’s the point? Their lives will probably be worse off than my own. Maybe they too will bemoan and rue my “millennial” generation for their selfish, narsasstic, self-titled “irony”. Maybe they’ll find it in their hearts to forgive a generation of people who’s entire golden existence gave them the gift of the word “selfie” and social media that harvests their data for shady governments. Maybe they can overlook the fact that I cant afford to send them to school or home them in a house and feed them because I simply can’t make enough. 

What will I tell them when the end finally comes and they ask me “What did you do to stop all of this?”... What will I say, “oh yes darling I know we now live in a filthy pile of rags under a bin in a environmental nightmare but we had banksy make up a load of pithy little tee shirts to raise awareness and subtly undermine the futility of the modern world. Isn’t that great?!” And then we can all die from a poison gas cloud melting our lungs into grape jelly.

So what’s the point? 

Honestly? Can anyone give me a fucking reason because at this point, I KNOW it doesn’t get better or easier. I KNOW that my life will just be one lurch of shit to another. I KNOW that none of this can get any better for me, I’m ready to quit. 

I have some beta blockers and a beer, I don’t want to sit around and wait anymore. 

I can’t do this. I can’t hold on. I can’t make it better. It just doesn’t go that way for me and I hate it. I don’t want to suffer anymore and be stuck poor and making do anymore. I can’t. Everyday I am stuck inside and just waiting for the courage to not be a pussy and eat all the meds I have. Who knows I’ll probably fuck that up in the end too.


Edit/Update: 

Hello dear gentle people who heard me and gave me such kindness when I was so low and lost. 

I am alive and yesterday morning I woke up, quit my shitty job and with the day finally to myself, I did something that I didn’t actually ever consider I would do being dyslexic and generally very pessimistic... I wrote a short story. 

Now it’s probably just all purple prose and rambling and dog shit but I was so moved and inspired by all of your sweet remarks of my rants that for once in my miserable little life I believed in me. I finished something, I saw fit to try for once. 

My partner is still an absolute cunt and so completely far up her own arse she might be wearing herself as a hat. I believe now this is probably because of her addictions or her god awful personality that metronomes quickly from toxic, incompetent and dumb to victim mindset mired in lack  of the cursed sickness “melodram-pathetism” and not ever changing. 

For the moment I’m still with her. She’s still emotionally distant and completely unself aware. I will see where this goes but I don’t have a huge amount of hope for her. I have a separate bank account so might indeed save up to get my own place away from everyone including her, even as a temporary measure. I am acutely aware of how little time I have really had all to myself and how little control I have in my life and it has become very clear, almost painfully so, that if she doesn’t care for me then I think she shall not fight for me. 

Until that point. I want to write. I feel like I need to live for something and that my writing can help. If anyone has and tips or pointers for assistance for where and how I can share my work I would be eternally grateful. 

Thank you all for helping me, and to all of those who reached out to me and found themselves in the same curled, gnarled words I put up here; I am only too sorry that there should be others that have to feel in that same way. Which is probably much more saddening than my rant in itself really, that so many more like me feel that way. I’m sorry you have also felt like this. I wish you all the very best and thank you again for your warmth and love.

15,Going from suicidal to very happy all in the same day,"I feel so lonely because I've never found anyone else who feels the same way. I have depression and ever since the really really bad times I've never quite related to any other depressed person. For example fake smiling (never had to do that unless I was on the brink of tears at school) I genuinely felt happy but I was still depressed.

Most of the times I think of suicide when a minor thing bothers me. Like when a friend unconsciously leave me out I think of suicide and I start tearing because of suicidal thoughts. Just minor things. I can be pretty genuinely happy beforehand but a minor thing happens and I'm emotionally unstable. Or one day I can be sure I just want to die and the next I can feel like I'm on top of the world. I also mainly get depressed when I'm on my own and not with friends.

Anyone else feel like that? Or is it just me?

0,It’s extremely messed up that you can’t even go to a psych hospital for help with suicidal thoughts without getting a multi-thousand dollar hospital bill.,"I was in a psych ward once when I was 17. I struggle with suicidal ideation daily. I would totally go back and get treatment at a hospital again if it weren’t for the horrible treatment of patients and the bill that would come along with it. My bill at my psych hospital was about $20,000. All because I wanted to jump off a bridge. You can’t tell anyone that you’re suicidal without them throwing you in a mental hospital, but you can’t go to a mental hospital without owing thousands of dollars and being treated like a prisoner, just making your problems even worse. There’s no good solution. I want to have the right to die. Or at least get free help. The suicidal hotline doesn’t do shit. I want real help. And not to be thrown in a hospital. This system is horrible. We are all victims of it. It’s time for a mental health industry overhaul.",gzuqi3,1853,1.0,136,2020-06-09 19:57:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gzuqi3/its_extremely_messed_up_that_you_cant_even_go_to/,False,False,2020,6
1,“Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem” I hate sayings like this with all my heart.,"People who say these sort of phrases have no fucking idea what it’s like to be in severe pain. They have no clue whatsoever. They’re either not educated on cases where people are in severe pain and don’t respond to treatment or they just don’t believe it. They can’t believe life can be that bad that suicide is the only option. And it’s because they’re basing their views on their OWN experience. Their OWN feelings and thoughts which aren’t the same as people contemplating suicide. 

If people who say these bullshit phrases could just take a step back and think about things logically. For example, a person posts that they are going to kill themselves. They have suffered in pain for years, they are damaged, they’ve tried countless treatments with no response and every day is filled with pain. Without the fortune of not being in their shoes, can they not understand why suicide is a viable option? Even if you can’t feel their pain, surely the facts can speak for themselves. You have to be a fucking idiot to read about a case like that and say to them “suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem” or “we have to play the cards we are dealt”. 

Do they really think that the suicidal person( after years of pain) is going to think “this quote has changed my perspective entirely. I think I’m going to live now’”. Whether the person intends to or not, sayings like this are patronising to people who have spent months or years weighing the options. I’m not saying they should just let them die if they’ve posted something like that. But patronising and bullshit quotes, when you can’t relate, just makes me pissed off. 

Although it’s hard and the person just wants to post to let the pain out, they can’t without receiving responses that make them feel patronised and stupid. In general I just hate sayings and quotes. They shouldn’t be applied to be such a common thing that applies to everyone and every case. There’s no right way to respond to someone suicidal, but saying quotes is not the way. Best way I can think of is just saying ‘I’m here if you need me for anything, if you want to talk”. I’m just a big believer in free will. No one should be confined to a life of pain.",hhpzqn,1476,0.99,150,2020-06-29 00:40:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hhpzqn/suicide_is_a_permanent_solution_to_a_temporary/,False,False,2020,6
2,I just realised that people don't really care about my mental health. They just care that I'm not a whining bitch anymore.,"Ive learned how to supress my emotions. No more crying. No more screaming at the top of my lungs when I'm in pain. No more hitting myself when I'm angry. No more panic attacks in front of others. I'm still in just as much hurt as I was before, now I just know nobody wants to deal with my bullshit. 

And you know what? Fair. Not even I wanna deal with my bullshit. But at least don't act like you do care when you don't. Nobody tried to help me solve my problems. They pretended they did. All they did was get me to a point where my problems were no longer anyone else's problems and called that me ""getting better."" Despite the fact that I am very visibily just as equally as bad as I was before.

6,"Likely won't commit suicide, but if someone pointed a gun at my head, I'd probably let them pull the trigger.","Does anyone else feel this way? I've been depressed for so many years, and I've been suicidal all this time. I've yet to attempt suicide, although I've come very close.

I doubt I'll commit suicide any time soon, partially due to the small spurts of dim hope I feel once in a blue moon. The bigger reason though, is because my sole living direct-family member is having a rough patch, and I fear they'd kill themselves too.

Nevertheless, if someone threatened to shoot me with a gun or I was caught up in a situation that endangered my life, I probably wouldn't mind too much. It would be even better if I could sacrifice my life for someone else—maybe then my life wouldn't have been in vain. I recognize the hypocrisy in that statement; after all, if I were willing to sacrifice my life for someone else, then why not sacrifice myself and live for the sake of my family member's life? I suppose that makes me selfish...

And yet, I can't help but feel drawn to such a death.

7,I just joined reddit. I'm 40 years old and suicidal. I have problems with porn. I've never had sex with a woman.,"At the suggestion of my therapist, he recommended I join reddit.  So, I'm giving this a try.  I'm 40 years old and suicidal.  I live in New Hampshire, USA.  I have been thinking lately, that, it is my time to leave this world.  I am also addicted to porn and have been viewing it for years.  I've never had a girlfriend, nor have I ever had sex with a woman.  I have only seen one escort in Boston, Massachusetts.  I was excited (too excited) about the prospect of having sex that while the escort and I were lying in bed nude (she was caressing my chest up and down) and she put her hand over my d\*ck, my rocket launched unexpectedly - yes, premature ejaculation.  Sometimes it happens.  Needless to say, we didn't have sex.

I am so depressed and lonely.  I have come to the realization that I'm unattractive to women and that there is no point in living anymore.  I hate my job.  I work in a call center for a major Boston-based insurance company.  It's a terrible job.  I get yelled at by people and I'm completely exhausted every day after talking on the phone with customers.  My job has nothing to do with my college degree.  I majored in marine transportation while attending a maritime academy.  I worked as a junior ship's officer aboard oil tankers for 2 years, but eventually I was fired.  The captain who fired me thought that I was incompetent.

My porn use has escalated.  I look at it almost every morning before I have to sign-on to my work computer to take calls from customers.  I'm working from home right now because of COVID-19.  Also, I don't look at porn on my work computer - I'm not that stupid.  I only look at porn on my personal computer.

In 2017, I asked out a woman at work who was older than me.  She was in her early 40s.  A beautiful blonde who had a very sexy face and a beautiful body.  Anyway, I got rejected and sometimes I think she rejected me because she thought I was ugly.

I'm currently seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist and the therapy just doesn't seem to work for me.  I feel so hopeless like nothing will ever get better.  I don't think that I will ever find a woman because I am unattractive and skinny.  I was going to the gym to lift weights, but then I stopped.

I did attempt suicide about a year ago.  After my attempt, my family suggested that I go to the hospital.  So, I went to Portsmouth Regional Hospital in New Hampshire into their Behaivoral Health Unit.  I spent 7 days there.  After I got out of the hospital, I felt better but then later on I started looking at porn again and felt depressed and lonely.

I've tried dating sites like [Match.com](https://Match.com) and [OKCupid.com](https://OKCupid.com) and haven't had any success.  I had a subscription for about 1 1/2 years and decided to unsubscribe recently because I just wasn't getting any responses from women.

The only thing that keeps me going are my two nieces who are 8 and 4 years old whom I enjoy playing with like hide-and-go-seek, ride bikes, play catch, play Monopoly and swimming in a pool.  I just love them so much.

Any advice?  I plan on seeing another escort because my goal is to have sex with a woman.  I just don't I have much of a life left in this world.  My uncle committed suicide at 45 years old and I've been strongly considering the same thing.  Maybe sooner if not later when I reach 45.

you wrote out a note explaining everything. hand written, over and over. hell, it’ll never say it all but it gets the point across. they will get a glimpse into what you were thinking. no more frantic late night texts. no more of them pretending to care. no more troubling the ones you love the most. they’ll be sad at first but in time they’ll remember all the good things about you and thats what they’ll say... she was so sweet. her heart was too big for this world. she had so much potential. we all loved her so much. 

so you’ll tuck into bed, knowing all that. you’ll finally feel at peace. thankful. it’s over. no more pain. get extra comfy, cover up. put the gun to your head and pull the trigger.

10,Killing yourself is selfish.,"That’s what most people would say. But do those people know what you struggle with on a daily basis? How hard it is to get out of bed? How hard it is to look into a mirror? How much pain they have been through? It isn’t fair. I give nothing but love and I get shit in return. I feel as if life isn’t right for me. I know I’d hurt people if I were to die. My mother would be destroyed the most but secretly does she know her child is already dying inside? That her child has no reason, none at all to keep trying. I don’t want to be in pain, but the ones I love the most, hurt me the most. So why keep trying? If I love someone so much to the point where they can hurt me 1,000+ times and I still continue going.. why keep going? They obviously don’t care about me, they love the fact that they’ll never lose me. I don’t want to die.

11,I don't eat or sleep anymore and I hope it'll kill me.,"As of writing this I have not slept for aprox 60 to 70 hours, have consumed no nutrition or water besides miniscule amounts that my primal instincts demanded of me. But I resist and have not eaten for 40 hours i believe.

And while as the pathetic worthless low value man I am, I can not even commit the simple heroic act of removing my inferior genes from the genepool through efficent means. To blow your brains out, jump in front of a train, burn yourself, I could've chosen so many ways.

&#x200B;

But here I am now hoping to perish. Eventually my body has to determine it has to shut down hopefully completely. I don't feel any pain from it anymore, in fact I feel nothing slowly becoming a husk.

I can still think clearly, in fact that is what I wish I couldn't. I can think so clearly that I'm hoping to die even more.

While I write this feel all the futility of existence wrap around me, hugging me lovingly, more than a lover ever could, not that I've ever known what a lover will ever feel like ever in my life, or a hug in general that is, not even from a mother.

&#x200B;

Not eating have saved a great deal of money, I used it on material goods that makes me forget the agony my body tries to remind me of. Though slowly the dopamine will stop producing in my brain, it has already happened somewhat. My passions of creativity has no meaning anymore, they're all just a symbolism of emposing death on myself in a vague form.

&#x200B;

Leaving a legacy is the kind of thing a lot of people tend to think about when they're decide to throw the match of chess with the reaper on purpose. It has been on mind all my life really, but not just a material or symbolic legacy but an actual physical one, a family to go on.

But that is not to be, I've reached the point where it's not possible, there is no hope now. And as I view even my material goods and symbols obscure into the black holes just like everyone elses I realize how little purpose there is in anything at all. I don't wanna be here anymore.

&#x200B;

And meanwhile as you skim over these useless words and symbols, it could be that I might've finally went to sleep.

&#x200B;

Hopefully to never wake up ever again.

12,"If I could exchange my life with someone who needs it more, I would.","I’m failing, I’m a huge disappointment. For all these years, I acted like I don’t give a shit about everything, my parents are extremely carefree, living almost like teenagers the day they got an annulment when I was 4. I didn’t grew up with any of them for my whole grade school and they’ve staggered back into my life when I reach mid-high school, I hate them. They made me feel like a burden, like an excess baggage, like I was holding them back to go on with whatever the fuck they wanted to do. I’m sorry if you made a souvenir from you fucked up marriage, trust me I didn’t want to be born either. I’m sorry if you always see your ex-spouse in my face and all of my mistakes, I’m sorry that I looked like a splitting image between the two of you. I’m sorry if I’m not the daughter you hoped for, I’m not academically smart, I failed my year, I couldn’t tell you. I don’t want to hear your judgement anymore, I already know how much of a waste I am. 

I’ve made my decision since April, I gave myself a small deadline but it kept on extending because luckily schools still have a hard time reopening and I feel pretty shitty leaving the two most important people in my life, my best friends.I don’t want to die, I just don’t want to exist anymore, so they don’t have to grieve and feel like they could’ve done something to save me but I really am just so tired. I can’t tell anyone how I’m feeling, whenever I opened up I’ll get set aside, told to be strong or they say that they’re for me when they’re really not. I dunno why I decided to spill my emotional baggage to a bunch of strangers in the internet but it sucks when I’m more comfortable opening up here than with my friends. 

It didn’t help either that I’m stuck 24/7 inside the house like most people are during quarantine but there had been riots outside and the government being a huge douchebag to it’s citizens. I know I’m being selfish when there are more important matters in the world right now; racism and discrimination, world hunger, poverty, abuse, people who have incurable diseases. I wonder why the world is such a harsh place, I know that life isn’t fair but what the hell?  If I could exchange my life with someone who needs it more, I would. 

I want people to know that I tried. I tried to ask for help, with my family, friends and even try seeking a counselor secretly because apparently, having a mental health problem is considered crazy, an attention seeker or being overly dramatic. My family told me to suck it up, I’ll survive, life isn’t fair. My friends told me they’re there for me but my trust issues says no, suffer on your own, you don’t want to burden them or overshare your sob story, my pride tells me to keep them in the dark with my troubles too because I’ve been perceived as a fighter in our group, I’m always the one who’d they run to when they have a problem, in need of an advice or if there’s a fight amongst us I’m always in the neutral. I don’t want them to see me so vulnerable like this. I reached out to my adviser and then a guidance counselor, I’ve immediately been told that everything between us with be kept confidential UNLESS they see certain signs and they’d immediately tell it to the proper authorities. Yeah, I ghosted him after that message. 

I wonder if those painkillers would really take effect if I swallowed it all. Would it really kill my pain?  

June 25th is my deadline, it sucks coz I’m actually looking a bit forward to my 18th birthday in July 5th but I have to do it. I can’t take anymore humiliation, suffering and disappointment. I’m still a failure.

I was born in a shit city and grew up in shit neighborhoods. Still here, still causing mental issues.

I was born with serious mental issues that caused me to harm people when I was younger.  

Never felt human at all or at least not for too long. Could never ground myself and always fantasized about leaving for another world. 

Ah, also unintelligent, going through school with poor grades, school fucked me up and causes my dreams to be themed around it nearly *every night.* Yet, people think I can make it through college. 

For some reason almost always irritable around family and tired of being constantly asked to do things, just want to be left alone. 

People have this romanticized view of me and contradict the truth that I'm evil and mean-hearted and deserve death. No matter how determined I am and how much I build myself up, I can't escape it. 

Pathetic, unless, unreliable, and a child in their mid-twenties. 

Pandemic has taught me how crazy it can drive you to be the house with people all the time. But I realize this just proves even more how mean I am. 

Considering who and what I am, my family would be lying if they say they wouldn't be better off. Who wouldn't reasonably trade not having to deal with that anymore? Or even for something better.

21,Fuck google,"It pisses me off that when I go searching for information on how to kill myself effectively and without pain all I get are half assed 'don't kill yourself' pages. The internet used to be a source of knowledge and now it's just a bunch of fucking brands and shameless self promoting content creators and seeing it makes me want to kill myself even more.

My fucking mother called the cops on me for saying I had suicidal thoughts once, so no: obviously I'm not going to talk to you about literally anything. Fuck you for making me exist without my consent.

I miss my dead pet. I can't stop picturing her dead, and covered in her own shit.

My fucking wife cheated on me. I read her emails, she was logged in on my PC. He straight up calls her a cunt and a fucking whore. That's who I got left for. I'm a fucking joke, I've been cheated on by everyone I've ever had a relationship with. She took out a credit card in my name and now I'm harassed every single day by people trying to get money from me. I'm in debt and I have no way out. She fucked this dude and now she's producer on his film. Can't wait for that to come out. I feel like everyone is laughing at me, the manlet cuck who got btfo.

I have intrusive thoughts about my genitals being mutilated all the time that cause me to physical wince, that is when I'm not literally spasming, probably from Parkinsons which runs in my family. I say shit out loud unconsciously like: ""Fucking kill myself"" and ""He killed himself"". I jerk myself awake at least once every night.

I cannot see anything getting better from here. It hurts every day and I'm filled with impotent rage. I've worked hard for so many years and I have nothing to show for it, and every day is worse than the last. My brain yearns for lead but this bullshit country wont even allow me the decency of a firearm to end this fucking charade.

23,Fuck the World.," If you kill or harm someone else, you’re scum. 

You are not allowed to kill yourself.

If you die, \*\*WE\*\* have to be the ones to kill you, 

after keeping you alive for fucking decades. 

You deserve to rot in jail. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If you abort, you’re sick. 

That’s a whole fucking life.

Even if it didn’t choose to be here, 

You have to push that shit out your body

And keep it alive for other people. 

Then, that baby, who grew into an adult, 

who didn’t choose to be here

is not allowed to fucking kill itself either. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tell anyone about your illness,

You’re a fucking stigma. 

""We're all here to help""

Until you want to fight for custody

Or defend a court accusation

EVEN if you fixed your shit, 

Then the way you drank you coffee on Tuesday

Plus that old diagnosis

Is a clear sign that you're unfit for ANYTHING. 





People will tell you \*\*TALK\*\* to them

Because it will make them feel better. 

Everything’s fine as long as you respond to 

their fucking messages. 

Just a quick fucking response, 

That’s all fifty fucking people are asking for. 

If you say “I’m OK, it means you’re fine. 

If you say “I’m not feeling good” 

they’ll worry and then call another day 

to rinse, fucking wash and repeat. 








OF FUCKING COURSE

You’ll eventually say “I’m OK”. 

That's what they're waiting for. 

Means they did their fucking job. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

OF COURSE you’ll fucking lie to get people off your back. 

The clearest sign that you are over your mental illness

Is obviously that you don’t talk about it any more.






EDIT 2: 
Marginally better.  

This was a really bad episode, so I thank all of those who responded supportively. Unsupportive, combative comments won't be responded to in the same way I did earlier, but I implore those commenters to respect that normal rules of conversation do not apply here going forward.
You are dealing with unwell human beings, please don't try to ""win"", or ""just say"". This is not about entertaining you. If you feel you might be unhelpful, please just observe, instead of commenting. Thanks. 

EDIT:

**READ BEFORE COMMENTING**

THIS IS A SUICIDE NOTE. DON'T TELL ME WHETHER OR NOT YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE. 

TO ALL THE IDIOTS TRYING TO ANALYSE THIS FUCKING SUICIDE NOTE - STOP. IDGAF IF IT DOESN'T APPLY TO YOU. I WAS NEVER FUCKING PREGNANT - NOR DID I KILL ANYONE ELSE OR TRY TO. NOR AM I FUCKING AMERICAN. 

THE WHOLE FUCKING POINT IS THAT THE WAY THE WORLD IS FUCKING SET UP NO ONE WILL FUCKING ALLOW YOU TO DIE, WHETHER YOU DESERVE TO, WANT TO, OR NEED TO. GENERALLY. IDGAF OF YOUR COUNTRY OR FUCKING TOWN IS AN EXCEPTION. ALL I WANT IS TO SAY A FUCKING GOODBYE TO PEOPLE I LOVE AND NOT BE FUCKING ""SAVED"". 

LIFE HAS TO BE DRAGGED ON IN THIS HELL, NO MATTWR FUCKING WHAT - AND JUST BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE WANT IT TO BE. 

IF A PERSON IS BAD LIKE ME, THEY STILL HAVE TO KEEP LIVING. THERE'S NO SUPPORT OR AT LEAST AN OK TO FUCKING KILL MYSELF. 

I WAS FUCKING CUT DOWN WHEN I WAS HANGING, AND THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A FUCKING VICTORY.

BUT I'M STILL FUCKING HERE SUFFERING BECAUSE OTHER FUCKING PEOPLE THINL I SHOULD FOR THEM. 

AND I DIDN'T FUCKING ASK TO BE BORN.

24,Too Cowardly To Kill Myself But Too Depressed To Keep Living,"This is not going to be an easy post for anyone to read or for me to write. To establish things immediately, no I am not considering s\*\*cide or am I in immediate danger. I would never do that to my mom, the one person in this world who truly knows me and cares about me.

With that said, I think I'm just done with life. It's been building for awhile and it just keeps building. It doesn't have much to do with the Coronavirus or the Riots but those have been the final straws. The Coronavirus has taken away my ability to even attempt to make new friends, try new activities or even do things I enjoyed like traveling and playing tennis. Luckily workouts have resumed in my state so I can do that. The riots have taken away my love for sports and history. It seems like everything I love slowly but surely is being taken away from me by various forces.

Even the activities I enjoy I don't enjoy as much as I used to. I feel like all they do is temporarily dull the mental and physical pain that I now feel constantly.

The Coronavirus has shown me just how hollow and empty my life has become. God is definitely not in my life and I am angry at him for various things (that I'll get into here in a minute). I am single and I have no kids or even pets to keep my company. While others at least had family to keep them company I've had no one. This Coronavirus pandemic has officially isolated me. Most of my family live in another state and I would be hesitant to travel for fear of getting them sick. Plus my nieces wouldn't see me anyway, they've bought into all the fear.

I have failed so often at dating it's become comical. I decided to get back into dating with stuff opening up. I went on a date on Tuesday that I thought was going well. We played mini golf but then, according to her, her perfume started messing with her allergies. We didn't have any food or drinks after the round as she felt like she needed to go home. I contact her Thursday where she tells me that she's been seeing another guy for awhile and that they have decided to be official and she wants to see where it goes. Needless to say I sent a nice little message to her, nothing rude but telling her I thought it was pretty low to have gone on a date with me knowing I had no chance. Like so many other times in my dating life I just felt used.

Besides being single with no kids or no pets I don't have a lot of friends. The few I do have know I struggle with depression at times and really do try to help. They all think I'm a very good guy who's just had bad luck and they truly believe I'm a good guy who deserves love and happiness. I just don't know if it's in my cards at this point.

Besides that my body failed on me pretty early. I'm 35 but my body started failing on me around 30. Always had high blood pressure that was hereditary. Now I'm slightly overweight, have hemorrhoids occasionally and also suffer from allergies and eosinophilic asthma. I was on a flight to Nashville back in 2017 (2 hour flight) where my throat really dried out. I started to panic which then caused my asthma to flare up. No medical emergency but it was a horrible flight. Now my doctor has me take a Xanax 0.25mg tablet before the flight to relax and a Prednisone 50mg tablet to control the Asthma. It's worked but whereas I used to love flying I now dread it. I feel like it's destroyed my ability to travel, I don't want to fly for longer than a few hours. But there's so many places I've wanted to see. I've asked my doctor about it and I've asked a Pulmonologist about it but they don't seem to take it seriously. I think they think it's all mental for me at this point. Ever since I became afraid to fly it's destroyed me a piece at a time.

So besides my body betraying me my mind has betrayed me as well. I know I've suffered from some Anxiety like I mentioned but even my therapist won't officially diagnose me with Depression. My mind is always half empty and I think my physical conditions have caused my mind to deteriorate.

All in all part of me truly wants to believe in reincarnation. That we get multiple chances at this life and that I'll just get another chance. I know Christian religions don't believe in reincarnation but it's one of the few things that gives me hope. I will say this, I think God made a mistake having me be born during this time. I believe I was born in the wrong time.

I have a job that's a good job but it's ultimately a dead end job. I've never been one who had that light click on in terms of a passion. I've always been adrift in terms of what I want to do. Yes I have a Bachelor's Degree with a double major in Management and Marketing. I also have my SHRM Certification as a Certified HR Professional. But if I'm honest I don't have a passion for any of it.

So my personal life is a mess. My physical health s\*cks, my mental health s\*cks. I don't have many friends and my dating life is an absolute failure. I feel like a lot of my passions are being taken away from me one by one. The Coronavirus is going to make it impossible to make new friends. The Riots have shown me that a lot of country hates me for my very existence. They hate me just for being a white conservative male.

I am a walking contradiction. I don't want to die and don't have to guts to but I've lost most of my will to live. I've wasted my youth, my best days are behind me and not in front of me and I no longer have any zest for life. Deep down pretty much nothing makes my happy anymore. Sure some activities dull the pain temporarily but I've lost the ability to feel happy. I've lost the ability to connect with people. I've lost any ability to have empathy or compassion. I just feel like I don't care anymore.

I don't know what I'm asking for out of this, I just had to finally get it out. I really don't know what to do at this point. If I could I really wish there was a ""do over"" button that we could press and start again. I wouldn't make all the mistakes I've made in my life. I would try to not be so da\*n introverted when I was younger which made it hard to make friends. I would've traveled the world before my health made my ability to travel by air an iffy proposition. I would've tried more activities to maybe find a passion.

I don't anymore guys. It just all feels so hopeless. If I had to use one emotion to describe myself at this very moment I think that's the one I would use. Hopeless.

27,I'm a waste,"Tonight I was going to do it. In my parents' home. I was going to lay on my bed and bleed out from my wrists and die. 

My mom walked in when I was just lightly scraping my skin to mark where I'd cut later tonight. She said ""I just wanted to see you."" I had to hide my body under the covers so that I could keep her from seeing what I had done to my arm and my body at that point. She came in and laid down on my bed and rest her head on my lap. ""It's comfortable,"" she said. I tried my best to hold back tears. 

She eventually left and now I'm here, staring at my razorblade, wondering why I'm left here as a sympathetic, pitiful loser. All I can imagine is my mom opening the door to my childhood bedroom and seeing my blood-stained mattress with a lifeless sack of organs on top. I can imagine her crying. 

I feel like a waste of money and time. The thousands of dollars that have been pumped into me for the promise of a successful future is too much. The time that people have invested in me for relationships and friendships is too much time that would've been better spent anywhere else. The only time I enjoy is time wasted on videogames and music. I am less than mediocre at both. 

My whole life has been infested with lies and attention whoring. I've lied about my age online so that guys wouldn't be afraid to talk to me. I've created a whole new person that interacts with me and my friend group online just so I can make my other friends jealous. I lie to my friends to manipulate them into doing what I want them to do. As for the attention whoring, I've done enough of it in my early teens. At 14, I was telling men online that I was 18. Id send them pictures of myself so that I could get validation. I craved the romantic attention that I never got at that age.

It's now 12am and I'm still here, scoring my thighs and spitting on the wounds. I've taken breaks while typing this and I feel like I'm ready. I just need some validation that I'm not the only one that knows that their life is completely fucked from decisions made by themselves. 

So. Speaking of decisions that I made that fucked up my life.
I'm living with 43° scoliosis that gives me severe backpain that (shocker) I have given to myself. I, as the attention whore I was in elementary school, longed for something that would make me different from the other kids at school. I sat in weird postures and slept in strange positions until my spine decided to follow through with my plan. The next scoliosis check that I had, I was told to get checked for scoliosis. Lo and behold, now I'm at a 43° curve that requires a long and painful surgery to fix. 
I also fucked with my eyesight as a child so that I could get glasses. Now I'm stuck with 7mm thick lenses in my glasses that signify that I'm legally blind to anyone that even sees my glasses. 
I AGAIN fucked up my life when I decided to go along with my parents' narrative and pretend to be Christian. Now I've been working at my church for 6 years. I've also been attending and tithing every week. I'm in the worship band and am currently planning a summer retreat. After 14 years of church, I still don't know what the fuck is going on.

I'm tired of being the second child that is happy and creative and spontaneous and yay!!!!

I'm tired of asking for help and never getting any

I'm tired of lying to people

I'm tired of being a waste of time and money

I'm tired of being completely mediocre

I'm so tired 

It is now 1am and I'm going to do it in 3 hours. 

time to write an unorganized essay for a suicide note.

would it be funny if i wrote it like how highschoolers write their essays? idk

thanks for reading my rambling and my unorganized baby-babble

edit: haha im still here. im still here. im still here.

i spent all night last night trying to write a suicide note, trying to justify myself, trying to excuse myself from living. i wrote a crude one and posted it here before i started the one i meant for my parents and friends. i got three pages in and i fell asleep from exhausting myself mentally and physically. a dark, dreamless sleep that has left me contemplating this morning. i look down at my thighs and my wrists and wonder if dying is really what i want. i read the beginning of my note and pity the author. my sheets are bloody from my thighs and i know my mom can already only handle the smallest bit of blood before going queasy. 

am i going insane? i cant follow through on anything, and now i cant follow through on my own suicide attempt. i had it all planned out and scheduled so that i could finally have something that i scheduled correctly. now im 5 hours late to my own death.

i read the comments in this post and I've spent the past 5 minutes trying to figure out a way to tell you I'm still here. i cant tell if what you all have said is something i should be grateful for or if i should despise you. i guess my answer will come in time. 

in the meantime, im still here and I still feel like shit. i felt like this kind of update is needed to this type of situation.",hako4o,490,0.98,43,2020-06-17 05:13:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hako4o/im_a_waste/,False,False,2020,6
28,"Sleeping and dreaming is the only enjoyment I get daily, anymore","Each day I wake up as I near closer to 24, I feel as though little has been felt to be accomplished by myself in my wandering through every new week. 

It’s all too much anymore to accept that my life has led me to where I am now— to simply accept that all of my successes and failures have ultimately left me lost in myself. I have no direction. I have no college education, my job prospects are slim with each one feeling terribly meaningless, giving no joy or sense of accomplishment for having attempted or even succeeded, at times to perform adequately.

I have a relationship, I suppose I am better for it, but each day I wake up, I feel as though every moment I try to engage with my partner, I bring him down in my depression. It seems only too much, the burden of my love; I feel I’m just too heavy a weight on those around me. 

I have lost all of my money and savings attempting to regain a sense of control over my life by spending money on groceries, simple things like helping around the house. 

Perhaps my issue is my mental illness I have yet to be diagnosed with, but my therapist seems to not care about any diagnoses of the sort. 

The crushing debt of sadness I get every day from waking up and not being in the dreams that made me feel purposeful and free from life and worries of financial struggle have left me feeling as though any happiness I can achieve is simply that— a dream.

It is selfish, but I lose my will to live more and more; I care little about actually dying, it seems the only person I am afraid to hurt is my beloved, but I fear I can’t stay suffering like this much longer, worrying about money, my worth, the pain of simply living. It has been months coming that I have been wasting away.

 Exercise only distracts my heart when I have someone with me, and the enjoyment fades all too quickly as soon as it begins, so much so before we finish the outing.

Calling some hotline has only left me feeling worse afterwards, but I try my best to hang on, if only out of love for my fiancé.

I feel as though my place in the world should have been found by now, I am still young, but why does my zeal for life flicker like a candle to the wind? I can’t enlighten myself to give much more, I feel. 
I feel the time is coming for my life to end by my own hand, as I can’t reckon enough willpower to handle the listlessness and longing for joy to come back. 

I don’t know when I will do it, but I try to encourage myself to make it to the end of the year, but I sense as though I may not make it to the end of this month.",gxn9me,456,1.0,33,2020-06-06 08:38:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gxn9me/sleeping_and_dreaming_is_the_only_enjoyment_i_get/,False,False,2020,6

1,Plans foiled by a f**king cat,"So I was going to do it yesterday, had my kit already and was psyching myself up to do it, when this young stray white cat comes up to me and just won't leave me alone. So I brought her inside and fed her. 3 cans of tuna later, she's still hungry and breathing kinda weird, but I'm allergic so I brought her back outside with a tuna can for the road...tonight I was also trying to work up the strength to end it all, when the cat shows up again, but can't eat and breathing is worse. So now I've taken her to an emergency vet and have no idea how long I'll be here, but my plans have been foiled. Goddam cat has no idea what she's done. 

For the record, vet said she's fine, just hungry, so I guess I've got a new neighbor.

Update: she's back in her parking lot where I found her with an extra big of tuna and water, and I know nothing about cats because apparently her ""breathing problem"" was non-stop purring.

Update 2: I'm alive, and a few weeks later the cat is staying with us for the time being until a foster or adopter shows up. Her name is Summer and she loves being part of the family.

Update 3: 5mo later, she follows us on our walks and loves our dog. I'm doing much better now and am going back to school in 4 weeks. Thanks for the love!

Update (10/2/21): Summer spent a wonderful winter with us! She made things brighter and happier. I knew I was slightly allergic all along, but it got so bad that my Dr finally said I couldn't have the cat in the house. This was a while ago, and my throat has permanent scarring from the constant irritation. Summer needs to be with people, so I made the very difficult decision to get her to a rescue group, and I'm glad I did! She was apparently pregnant (I'd thought she was spayed) and her babies were safe and cared for and all of them got fixed and are now ready for adoption. I got to reunite with Summer at the adoption center this last week and she was so excited to see me! Heartbreaking ending, but she helped save my life, and I was able to thank her for that. I'm doing great, my Dr said technically my depression is in full remission!

I'm sorry to the kid who when he god a little older always dreamed of being a doctor or entrepreneur. I'm sorry to the high school student who worked so hard for an impossible dream. How could I ever look you in the eye, how could I ever face you with the way things turned out? My past selves. I'm happy for you. Happy that you got to experience wonder, happiness and joy. And that you always dreamed big. Your dreams were always too big, too much disparity between your skills, and what you wanted. Knowing that those silly dreams thought up by some silly little kid are all but impossible, makes the decision to go a little easier. It's a stark reminder of the cold unforgiving nature of the world. A reality check. I guess you were never really meant for this world, and it turns out stopping the pain is all that really matters now.

16,Update,"2 days ago I had all the necessary ""equipment"" gathered and felt so ready for my exit. I was sitting on the pier watching people in the afternoon, taking it all in, mentally saying goodbye essentially. There was a man playing with his daughter nearby, and I remembered the times my dad would play with me in the snow, at the park, and when he explained why the sky was blue and sunsets red, and how his voice trembles when he talks to me now because they're so worried, and how I haven't called him in days because I'm so ashamed of where I am.

I've felt half dead for 15 years and for 15 years my parents guided me to the surface at every step. How can I do that to them and take their only daughter away? There is no way. No fucking way I'll allow those two people suffer like that. 

I called my parents today, picked up my antidepressants from the pharmacy and made conversation with a lovely stranger over ice cream. I'm here, if anyone was wondering. I'm not going anywhere.

17,"[LONG UPDATE] 16 years old. I went on a walk, and the light was golden on the trees that arched above me. It was like heaven's gates. It was like God telling me to come home.","Linking in my previous post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ht43ep/16\_years\_old\_i\_went\_on\_a\_walk\_and\_the\_light\_was/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ht43ep/16_years_old_i_went_on_a_walk_and_the_light_was/)

I had absolutely no idea that my post would generate such a response. It is 9:32AM here in the UK as I write. I have just woken up and I'm completely blown away.

Evidently, I failed. This is the update I promised. It's long. I hope someone will still read it.

I think I should start earlier on, last afternoon, before I planned to go. I have read every single chat and comment left to me, and it seemed a lot of people related, or were touched in some way, so I think I should offer some of my story in return. Maybe some of you can find yourselves in this update. This is for you.

&#x200B;

I think it was around 3PM yesterday that I decided to end my life. I'd had a relatively uneventful morning. I'd already been on a walk with my mother down to the lake mentioned in my previous post, in efforts to ease some of the emotional tension that had been building for a couple of days. It didn't help. Cutting myself didn't help. I told her I felt trapped.

It was only after the words passed my lips, in the silence of the woods down by the lake, that I realised such language was a hallmark of the suicidal. Trapped. It almost evoked a grin. I hadn't even figured that suicide was already so deeply entrenched in my brain that it was spilling out into my words. I read an excellent book a few years ago where grief was literally a big black bird. It was as if said bird had landed on my scalp and I'd only just realised that its claws were prodding into my brain. What an image.

Afterwards, I got home. Something had finally cracked. I'm not sure what got pills into my brain, but once I'd locked onto the idea, it seemed an obvious choice. I felt a strange sense of clarity and resolution. I knew that it was dangerous to feel that way, but I enjoyed it. I went out into the garden - it was sunny - put my headphones on and listened to the Smiths. I lay down on the grass and crossed my arms over my eyes. I couldn't see, or hear anything (apart from Morrissey). I wondered if this was what it was like to be dead, to have this feeling of being alive but to lack all senses.

The song finished, and I sat up and opened my eyes. Everything was hazy and blue, in that strange way when you've shut your eyes against the sun for too long. It did feel almost heavenly, sat there in the grass. I felt lighter and cleaner than I had in a long time. As stated previously, I'm not a Christian, or any religion for that matter, but it was there in my garden that I first had this sense of God being with me. Everything was beautiful in a way I had never experienced before. It was as if everything had been prepared for me once last time. I felt at peace.

I sat there in the grass until I was called in for dinner. I ate with my family. I couldn't look them in the eyes once. Sticking with the religious theme, it had the same sense of doom as the Last Supper. I almost laughed. I don't know why.

I went out for another walk after dinner, back to the same lake as earlier. I think it had just gone 8PM, so the road through the woods was very empty, and the sun was just low enough in the sky to give that gorgeous golden tint to everything. I have lived in the same house all my life, so I must have walked this road at least a thousand times, but it was as if I was seeing it fresh. The leaves hanging above me looked so light. I saw that golden arch of trees that I mentioned in my other post, just at the end of the road where the woods thickened. It was as if I was being welcomed home. I felt a strange sense of euphoria as I passed through them, like I'd won some sort of prize. I walked past a couple with their dogs. I smiled and said hello. I wonder what the expression was on my face. Did it look as though I was breaking, or was it peaceful?

I got to the lake and sat down on the bench in front of it. The golden light was just skimming the trees - they're tall. It was entirely quiet. I have never known such quiet. The lake was completely still, except for the little circular ripples from the flies hitting the water. The sky had faded into a quiet greyish blue.  It was about 8:30PM. There was nobody else at the lake.

I knew then, in that stillness, that I wanted to go. In that stillness, I felt that every leaf, every pebble, even the rocks at the bottom of the lake had been placed there for me. I don't know whether it was a last-ditch attempt by the universe to get me to stay, or a send off. Like when Simon dies in Lord of the Flies, and all the little silver creatures come to carry his body away on the tide. I think it was a bit of both. It made me feel happy. 

When people freeze to death, they don't feel cold. They feel warm.

I got up, walked back down the road - and the light was fading, but it was still beautiful - and I got home. I messaged a couple of people that I wanted to say goodbye to, just to wish them well. I got changed into my favourite pajamas. I had a cup of tea - how English of me, to have one last cuppa. (I'd never liked this country.) I hugged my mother goodnight and I told her I loved her. I haven't told her I loved her in a decade.

I got into bed - it must have been around 10:30PM by this point - and I wrote my previous post. I'm not sure what I was looking for, by writing it. I didn't expect anyone to respond. I expected it to be the last mark I left on the world. I was okay with that. I hit post. I got a few replies. I responded. It was 11:50PM, I remember it clearly. I turned off my laptop. I went downstairs to get the pills to kill myself.

I barely remember ripping them from the packet. I don't think I felt anything. I was empty as I lined them up. There were only 8, but I'd done my research. One for each year of my life that I'd felt this way. It was enough to die - I don't weigh much - but I realised that it was also enough for me to live. I didn't feel terrible about that. I had responded to one of the comments on my other post about how I was willing to gamble. I had a bottle of water. I was ready.

It was then that I realised my willingness to take a gamble meant that I might want to live. I sat looking at those pills for a long time. I looked at the clock. It was nearly 1AM. I realised I was tired. And the suicide note I'd left was pretty badly written. And there was a party going on, down the street. I figured that even if I took the pills as an act of self harm, not suicide, I'd still have to call an ambulance, and I didn't particularly want that happening in front of a house full of people.

I laughed. It was almost stupid. I wanted to die - I wanted to die so much - but the little things were holding me back. I'd had a perfect send-off from nature. Hell, I'd had a decent last day as a whole. But at the final moment, there were still things that were too amiss for me to go forward. I felt ungrateful. I felt ashamed. I felt empty. But I figured that I could still kill myself another day. It could wait. I went to sleep. I still felt nothing.

&#x200B;

So. I failed, not because I took them, but because I was too afraid to take them. I've been afraid of failure all my life. It's always held me back, but maybe that saved me then.

&#x200B;

I accepted a long time ago that this is just the way it is. Just the way things are. It is the sort of life you might overhear in hushed conversations of the aisles in the supermarket - terribly, terribly sad, and then the conversation is moved on and it is forgotten. Back to the bottles of wine and the crisps.

&#x200B;

But I think there is still a part of me that desperately wants to live. I have so much I want to offer. I write poetry. I want someone to read it sometime. I applied to a summer school. If I killed myself last night, I wouldn't know if I got in. I'm going to refresh my email in a minute, to check.

&#x200B;

I'm here writing this - 11:11AM - and I can still feel that big black bird, sitting on top of my skull. I still want to die. I saved the pills. I put them in a little bag. I understand I might've lost any credibility from my last post - after all, I said I wanted to die and then didn't - but I hope someone is still hearing me. I think I'll take another look at the pills tonight. I hope someone is maybe still holding my hand. I need it so badly.

&#x200B;

But I'm still here, at least for a little while. Maybe a few hours. Maybe days. Maybe years. Maybe just until my 17th birthday. I don't know how long I'll have the courage to hold on for. But I'm still holding on.

I didn't think anyone would listen. This is a really long post - hell, I doubt anyone's reading at this point. But I know I was heard. I woke up to so much love this morning. All I can say is thank you.",htegww,687,0.98,157,2020-07-18 10:27:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/htegww/long_update_16_years_old_i_went_on_a_walk_and_the/,False,False,2020,7

25,"16 years old. I went on a walk, and the light was golden on the trees that arched above me. It was like heaven's gates. It was like God telling me to come home.","Title. I'm thinking of ending it tonight. I went on a walk down to this lake by my house and God, it was beautiful. It was like one final send off from nature - almost as though in that moment, it had been put there for me. The lake was perfectly still, and that golden light was just gracing the tops of the trees. I'm not actually religious, but I think it was the universe's way of telling me to let go, to return to God.

I'm suicidal for a whole range of reasons. Have been for 8 years - half my lifetime. I've never come so close to ending it before. Something suddenly clicked a couple of nights ago and things became too painful to bear. The straw that broke the camel's back. I started cutting again. It didn't help. Nothing makes a dent in this pain and shame.

I can't tell if this handful of pills means I actually want to go, or if it's a cry for help. I know it's pathetic - but I think I'll only take 8, that's in the potential danger zone for people of my weight. It will be in the hands of the universe to decide if it's my time to go.

I just want someone to hear me. There are 690 people online. I hope someone's there to listen. I hope someone will maybe hold my hand over the internet if I go. It's a funny image, those hands reaching through those computer screens, but it makes me tear up.

I hope that if I succeed, someone else fails. Your life is worth something, if you're reading this. Mine isn't.

4,i wish nobody cared about me so i could kill myself without destroying other lives in the process,"hi. i have been struggling with severe depression for almost 2 years now. i don’t really want to get into it but it’s because of something that is no ones fault and just a case of really bad luck. i wish the people who cared about me recognised that i was struggling and that there’s nothing to do to fix it. but i know deep down that if i kill myself they will blame themselves and it could ruin them. 

i don’t want to be here, i’m only here because i don’t want to ruin the lives of the people who care for me. sometimes i think that i can just continue to live on despite being miserable for the sake of other people’s happiness, but i’m not sure whether i’m going to make it. almost every thought i have eventually loops back to suicide, no matter how happy the initial thought. 

i’ve made a plan to stick it out until my siblings finish their exams. after that i’m pretty sure i’m going to kill myself.

6,Today I tried to kill myself,"I got in a nasty fight with my mom. I always said if my mom stopped loving me or died that would be it, nobody would care if I died. I still believe that, but It never should have warranted this. I sat down, cut into my thigh, and took 13 pills. Doesn’t matter of what. This gives me a high and I start feeling stupid and dizzy. I’m texting my friend and joking about all my trauma and i’m just feeling worse. I tell her about what I did and she naturally got worried. She told me to throw up (I couldn’t) and texted my mom and my best friend. It was such a stupid thing to tell her, but over sharing, my biggest fault, saved my life. At this point i’m dizzy, pained, and nauseous. My mom bursts in yelling at me and tells me to sit down. I tell her i took 13. I never told her why. The paramedics come and i’m sitting on the couch. My speech at this point is calm, almost robotic. I get overly polite around authorities because of deep psychological issues. They check me, vital organs are fine. I’m alive. Everyone leaves the room except for the kind paramedic who was taking my blood pressure. He asked me if I was lying, because I swore up and down it was an accident. I told him the truth. About my sexual violations, and my issues with self worth, and my father and brother. I told him how I didn’t want to die deep down. I wish I did. That would make things easy. They left and my mom cried like never before. She told me i’m her only child, she won’t get another chance. That’s when everything hit me. It was like a new chance. A fresh slate. I looked in my room and imagined it empty. Everything had so much meaning. I couldn’t imagine it going to anyone else, me not using it ever again. I just cried. I’m crying now. I’m so fucking happy I only took 13 pills. However i’m not happy it’s an uneven number. I don’t think I’ll ever try to change it though.

Hey, I have an update! I’ve been seeing professionals. I have some jumble of schizophrenia OCD depression and whatever. Today was my first day taking medication. Life is good.

I called 911 on myself because I knew I wasn't gonna die anyway. At least, not for days and days after the overdose of the medication I chose. I was told by my guardian that I did it for attention. Totally not true, for the record. Instead of supporting me like I really needed it, most people turned their back on me or punished me in some way. I spent 2 weeks in a psychiatric hospital. That was my 8th inpatient hospitalization for the same reason.
I was really suicidal. I still kind of am, just not as strongly as I was then. I've tried to move on and not attempt again. I haven't told anyone I'm feeling this way again because I don't want them to think negatively of me again. I'm so tired of being alone.

When I do bring up my feelings and how she hurt me, it always turns into an argument. “Oh so you’re saying I’m just a bad friend?” And then when I don’t tell her it’s “you never tell me anything.” I’m so tired of having to tell her what to do or how to make things up to me. We’ve been friends for 6 years, I wish she just knew to apologize without being contradicting and defensive. When she tells me that she’s hurt I beg her to tell me why. I make sure to sit down with her and get to the bottom of things until she feels better. 
Anyway, all of that is just useless drama and doesn’t have a lot to do with me thinking of killing myself, but it sure doesn’t make it easier to live. Basically it sucks that I hate myself and my friends seem to hate me too.

I've been suicidal for so long that killing myself has become a potential answer to every problem or question or stressor, an advocate for death in the back of my mind. 
Constantly. Even when I've been in better patches, that part of me still breathes these questions into my mind.

""But what if we just stopped existing?"" 
""Is my existence *really* worthwhile?""
""Does your life have any real meaning?""
""Why are you still alive?""

Healthy brains just don't fucking ask those questions incessantly. They don't have existential crises in response to every little task.

There is something so fundamentally wrong with the building blocks of my psyche that makes me hate myself and have no will to exist, and very little seems to touch that basic flaw in my code.

28,Is it normal to think about death all the time?,"I think about death all the time. I think about how, after my mom passes, I’ll die. I think about sending my boyfriend and the dog away to visit his family, and then finding new homes for my cats, and then just ending it. I know there are people other than my mom who love me, who would be sad if I died, but they’d move on eventually. They have other friends and family. They don’t -need- me.

I tried to tell a friend recently how I’ve been feeling, and she told me that she needed me, her best friend, to live for her. Which is a lie. She has a loving fiancé and tons of other friends. She would be sad, but ultimately my death would mean nothing, even to her, after some time. She doesn’t need me.

My boyfriend, he might need me, but I don’t feel like I’m good for him. Not when I spend nearly every waking moment wishing for my own death. How can I support him when I can’t even support myself? He moved very far  away from home to be with me, but he is probably better off back home with his family, in an environment where he is actually comfortable. He might need me, but that doesn’t mean I’m good for him.

I don’t want anyone to need me either. I want it to be okay to die after my mom passes. I don’t want to spend another 30+ years struggling on this earth. I never even imagined I’d make it into my 30s. To make into my 60s? Impossible. What’s the point?

Life just feels so meaningless. Even when I try to find meaning, I always hit roadblock after roadblock. Depression and anxiety always hold me back. I’m so tired of trying, of fighting, of being.

So if you’re wondering if I’m still here yes, yes I am I’m just really fucking bad at killing myself. Next time, when I get out of here I’ll just go straight for the gun.

0,Please remember that NO ACTIVISM of any kind is allowed here. Not today or any day.,"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide *is*, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times.  

Please understand that we're all for well-informed, strategically-savvy activism.  It's essential in the fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and the fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding.  Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL.  

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population.  We used to allow it, until the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming, and, not without regret, we made this rule.  Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our members' wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

**Please report any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's mainly about a cause or an issue rather than a request for personal support.**",iq0w21,2271,1.0,111,2020-09-10 10:39:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/iq0w21/please_remember_that_no_activism_of_any_kind_is/,False,False,2020,9
1,"i told my mum i want to kill myself. she said, “ok, just don’t do it in my house.”","that’s basically it. it hurts. i wish people didn’t romanticise a mother’s love so much because then maybe these words wouldn’t sting as much as they did. how is a teenager supposed to feel when the one person who’s apparently supposed to love them more than anyone and anything, doesn’t?

edit: 
yes, I totally understand that parents are just human beings...but when a relationship, any type of relationship, starts to cause damage to one and the other knows this but refuses to acknowledge it or somehow change for the better, then they simply do not care for the person. I only opened up to my mum about depression very recently though I’ve been dealing with it for a few years now. at first, I used to think the reason I was constantly hurt by her actions and words was because she didn’t know the mental state I was in back then so I never blamed her in anyway. but it all became too much that i impulsively told her everything and she still refused to do anything. she’s not empathetic in the slightest and she made it clear that whether I commit suicide or not doesn’t matter to her as long as, like I said in the og post, I do not do it in her house or say anything in my suicide letter about her that’ll give her a bad rep or get her in any trouble. point is, I thought I was suffering so much because I kept my feelings to myself. I thought sharing them raw with her would help even a little but it didn’t and I feel so defeated. people always say you shouldn’t keep these type of things to yourself but there’s comfort in that. giving myself the illusion that the only reason I hurt is because I keep it to myself hurts less than sharing it with others and realising that that hasn’t changed the way i feel. you don’t suddenly get better. it only stays just as bad or gets worse. 

and to anyone and everyone who’s sharing similar stuff, I’m sorry that some of your most treasured people aroused some of the most negative feelings in you. it’s okay to feel hurt but don’t let someone else’s decision to be a dick affect your own life decisions because in the end, everyone will be looking back at their own life and their own life only. make sure that yours isn’t just a reflection of what others have said and done to you.

i apologise if this is really lengthy I know I keep rambling I just wasn’t expecting this many people to see this. to everyone who’s tried to help or who’s hurting, you have a special place in my heart.

6,I wish I was allowed to commit suicide.,"I hate how suicide is so stigmatized by society, and how much guilt-tripping there is surrounding the issue.

Everything in the whole world dies in the end, and I would rather that end be sooner so as to avoid putting up with all the hardship in between. I can hardly bring myself to be interested in anything anymore, so to me the world is at best boring and at worst painful. I have little interest in ""improving"" either myself or the world, as both things turn to dust in the final analysis, along with any accomplishments I or anyone else might make. I just want this whole pointless existence to be over already, as I see literally no point in it continuing. I am aware that this might hurt people around me, but honestly their entire existence, let alone any pain they might feel, is as fleeting and pointless as my own. I just wish it was socially acceptable to see that suicide can be a rational decision and to act accordingly. Maybe then people would not feel so trapped in a worthless life, and would be able to commit suicide in a relatively safe and painless manner rather than using their own makeshift methods.",j2cmuj,1009,0.99,96,2020-09-30 01:26:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/j2cmuj/i_wish_i_was_allowed_to_commit_suicide/,False,False,2020,9

1,Today I realized that I'm probably going to actually commit suicide sometime in my life.,"It may not be today, tomorrow, or even 10 years from now, but I honestly think there's a 90% chance that the way I will end up dying is by killing myself. I've struggled with depression since I was 14. I've been making significant progress in therapy and I am the happiest I've ever been. But somehow I keep ensing up depressed and coming back to these thoughts.

I have a fear of being elderly and alone. I am divorced, don't have kids, and don't have many friends. I'm afraid of living in an old folks home and just being forgotten about. And then today I realized that I pretty much already am forgotten about. I moved across the country a couple years ago, none of my family or friends ever call me. My mom never calls, my sister doesn't call. The only time my best friwnd messages me is to complain about her life. She never asks me how I'm doing or what's going on with me. I'm always the one calling them, and if I don't we simply don't talk. It's like my fear of being alone has come true, the only difference is I'm younger and able to take care of myself still. I do have an amazing boyfriend, but lately I keep screwing shit up so I wouldn't doubt it if he left me soon too.

So ya. It may not be today or tomorrow, it might even be 10 or 20 years from now. But unless I have an accident of some sort this will probably be how I die.

Edit: Wow I can't believe how many people have the same thoughts and feel the same way. I'll try to reply when I can. It's comforting to know we're in this together. Thanks for the encouragement everyone. It actually brightened my day a little. And please please don't hurt urselves. One thing that has made a huge difference so far for me is EMDR therapy. I've tried all kinds and that one has helped the most. I still do have suicidal thoughts, but they aren't as often as they used to be, so that's good I guess.

3,"I tried to hang myself a few hours ago and failed, now i feel dumb and decided to not do it anymore","A few hours ago, i finally reached my peak and hooked up a noose. But after trying to hang, the hook broke on me and left me shaking, body cold, and my neck feels like it just went through boot camp. I was left with this chilled and frightened feeling, because it was just so new. It had me stare at the ceiling and think about things. But after that i just thought to myself if i really wanted to die or not. It took me a few hours to meditate and contemplate over what i did and now i feel dumb for even doing that.

I would want to share what's up, but I'm already over it. Though I'm not really against opening up, i just don't want to bother too many people.

4,"I attempted suicide, almost died and did *not* regret it. Am I truly doomed","I see many people here talking about their attempts, how they immediately regretted it, and how glad they were when they survived. That has not been my experience.

I tried to hang myself last month. There was no apparent trigger, and I really wasn't thinking about much: no friend/family, no lover, no pet, no future. I was just glad to finally get out, and vaguely confused why I hadn't done it sooner. Within minutes I tied a noose, stepped on top of a box, put my head through the noose, and knocked the box over. I was not sad: I was just calm, and relieved for the first time in many years.

I don't remember what happened immediately after (must have passed out), but I woke up lying on my back, part of the noose still stuck around my neck. Apparently the rope snapped after I lost consciousness.

I remember being overcome by a deep sense of disappointment. When I looked into the mirror my face looked horrible, all purple (almost black) and swollen. I knew I had every reason to be scared, but I felt nothing.

It's been a month, and I thought about doing it again-doing it right-every day. I did not feel lucky that I survived. Instead, during the past month, there were countless times I thought: ""I wouldn't have to be doing this if I were dead.""

I know I'm going through a difficult phase in life. I know things \*might\* get better. But I'm just... disinterested. All these good things life has to offer seem so out of reach, and so abstract that I feel no craving for them. I'm so so exhausted, yet nobody in this world would accept me for just existing. Living has become a chore, a resistance to the temptation of death, while I'm not even sure what's the point.

I would like to live, even if for nothing other than seeing it through. I'm just... so unmotivated to. Maybe it's just laziness.

14,I fucking hate working. Everything is meaningless. I have no motivation and everyone keeps ignoring me.,"My brain is so fucked up that I can’t derive joy out of most things. I try to be a good person but life constantly proves that nothing matters. It’s all so fucking stupid.

I hate working these goddamn meaningless jobs that only serve to ruin my day. New job already is off to a terrible start and I can’t imagine it’ll get better. 

I have constant irrational thoughts about many aspects of my life and it makes me want to puke. I will never know what it’s like to be “normal” and it eats me up inside. How does it feel to not worry about everything, even things that don’t make sense, but my brain convinces me are real?  

Nostalgia is not comforting. I remember parts of the past and only feel pain. 

I am fundamentally broken on many levels and I do not believe repair is possible. The only permanent fix is a bullet to the brain. 

Goodnight.

16,"Early 30s, female, no friends, NO CONNECTIONS, no intellect, no attractive physical features, learning disabilities, mental illness, tons of debt, and no college degree--an impossible rut.","I understand if u want to scream at me to stop whining but I have nowhere else to turn, no way out of this rut. At this point it's slowly becoming a matter of when I kill myself and not if. Any helpful advice out of this rut, (since outright asking for suicide methods isn't allowed, although any suggestions for a painless suicide are much appreciated and welcomed) would be greatly appreciated. 


Currently, receiving  any mental health is near impossible because my health insurance doesn't cover any resources in (or remotely close) to my area, (and I can't afford the funds to travel out if I had to).


  Out of despiration,
I turned to God in my darkest times, who continued to promptly ignore me **and actively made things worse immediately afterward.**    Felt like I prayed to demon or something. So turning to God/faith is absolutely out of the question. I'm done tearfully pleading my case to the ceiling.
 

Living each day is like a chore. It's not living. It's nothing but soul-crushing days followed by sleepless nights. Self confidence? Never heard of her. If I had a clear path out, I'd do anything I could not to be me.

18,"Hey yo, FUCK YOU to whoever tied up their dog inside my chicken coop","I’m so fucking done. I woke up this morning to my dog barking so I looked outside. I didn’t see anything . It was like 8 am and I was still tired so I just went back to bed. Fast forward to about an hour later, my dog hasn’t stopped barking so I’m a bit nervous. It’s about time for his walk so I put him on a leash and head to the back door. Low and behold, THERE IS A FUCKING DOG IN THE CHICKEN COOP. 

If you look at my post history, you know that I fucking loved these chickens, I raised them with the help of my sister and they were our babies. We originally said we were gonna eat them when we got them but the more we hung out with them, the more we realized how smart and kind chickens are. As stupid as it was, they were part of the family. We named them, celebrated their first eggs. Cuddled them, spoiled them. Like I said, they were family. 

Now imagine the absolute horror I felt when I saw some big ass dog eating my babies while they bleed out screaming, knowing I could’ve saved them if I wasn’t a lazy piece of shit. I ran out there as fast as I could screaming in terror. At first I thought it was just a case of a stray dog because there was a hole in the side of the cage but then I started investigating. 

The dog had a knot around his leash connected to one of the perches that were stapled to the ground. 

The lock on the bottom of the door was open but the top was closed. My sister and I always close the top and the bottom. 

After we got the dog out, we found five alive chickens and put them in a dog cage but he had no interest in them.

The hole in the side of the coop was jetting outward, meaning something tried to escape

I think that what happened was that someone waited for my mom to leave to go to the park 7:40 am, grabbed the dog, put it inside the cage, unhooked it to tie the leash to the perch, the dog tried to get out which in turn led to him biting the hole in the chicken wire, and halfway through the dog’s escape the intruder pulled it back in, causing the bloody pieces of dog fur on the rim of the hole, the the intruder made his escape through the door but since the door was jammed he only locked the top lock.
[My poor babies](https://imgur.com/gallery/sWMUy0l)

It’s probably the same person who broke into our cars about two days ago. I don’t understand why I’m being targeted. I called the police but they of course didn’t listen and just took the dog to paws. Someone needs to be in jail for this. I know that if this happened any other year the police would’ve put more effort but they’re probably just trying to make a statement that blue lives matter just cause I’m black. 

Also my parents and I have been arguing like crazy. I came out as trans (ftm) to them maybe like 2 months ago and it’s been downhill from there. My mom was supportive at first and then I told my dad and she suddenly switched to his side?? Now she keeps being passive aggressive about it by constantly saying stuff like “Some girls have guy features but you don’t. You need to embrace how PRETTY you are. YOURE such a PRETTY GIRL.” My dad finally let me cut my hair but he constantly bashes on trans people saying stuff like “Trans people don’t deserve rights because they’re mentally ill” despite me being not only trans but also schizophrenic. And he also threatens to take away my internet every time I respect anyone’s pronouns. They’ve also been arguing between each other a lot more. Nothing physical but they get really loud and it freaks me out because I have really bad noise sensitivity.

I want to get out of here so bad. Not like my home but this entire existence. I could rant on and on about how much I would enjoy an eternal slumber but I’ve already been typing for like 2.5 hours so I should stop here

9,“You’re not alone” doesn’t help me and I don’t know why anybody thinks it will,"I don’t understand why people say shit like this, along with lines like “other people have it worse” “things always get better” “you don’t have it so bad”

Like, how do people not understand that this shit makes me feel WORSE? I already know I don’t have it as bad as other people! That just makes me feel even shittier because I should be seizing the opportunities I have, but I don’t. Keeping myself from spiraling down even further is like a full time job, leaving me no time or motivation to do anything else. 

I don’t see how I can possibly move past this when I can’t even bring myself to have a basic daily self care routine. I feel like I’m working my ass off and moving literally nowhere. I’m 30 with no job, no money, no girlfriend (or friends in general), and no self esteem. 

I’m a fucking manchild who still has to be supported by his parents. I constantly see and feel the judgement of people when they start to piece together my life and realize I’m just a fucking loser. I was never as smart or capable as I thought, I was just really good at faking it. But now people can see that I’m really just a pathetic piece of shit and nobody wants to be around me anymore.

The one thing I had left was my looks and now that I’m going bald, that will fade away soon too. I’m so lucky to have parents who offer to help, but they’ve already spent so much on me that I just feel fucking pathetic making them do anything else for me. I can’t stand leaving the house now and I’ll put off simple tasks like getting groceries for weeks, rationing my food and sorta starving myself until it becomes unbearable and I work up the courage to go outside.

Everyone I get close to fucking leaves me and I’m sick of building up relationships just to be broken down over and over again. This shit is fucking dumb and I really don’t see the point in putting myself through all this suffering just to inevitably end up with a mediocre life. This wasn’t how shit was supposed to go down.

I just wish my parents weren’t around so I didn’t feel so bad about killing myself. They’ve already lost their only other kid, and I can’t put them through that pain again, especially when I have a choice. But I just don’t see how things will get better. I’ve been spending fucking years trying to improve myself and I feel like I’ve only gotten worse.",jwlwoj,960,1.0,74,2020-11-18 19:00:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jwlwoj/youre_not_alone_doesnt_help_me_and_i_dont_know/,False,False,2020,11
10,My sister tried to kill herself two days ago.,"So. 

So. Friday night, my sister took a whole bottle, 60 pills worth, of her antidepressants. Beforehand, she had called around and apologized to a few people about things that I'm not privy to. This set off alarm bells, and somebody called emergency responders to the scene. 

When they arrived, they found her with a note, and... well, she survived. They took her to the hospital, but now she is in a behavioral health clinic. A state away. And we can't go see her. 

I am at a loss. I. Don't even know if this is the right place to come with my story. Or even what I want by telling said story. I just. 

I almost lost my sister. I was *this* close and had no idea. None. I hate this feeling. And I can't even go to her. I don't know. I don't know where to go, or what to think. 

Mainly I'm just talking I guess. Then you for reading.

11,Wish someone would thank me for staying alive,"Made the mistake 2 years ago of showing a close boyfriend all my suicidal moments.
Turned very toxic, obviously, and now I learned to keep my mouth shut.

Current boyfriend sees my fresh cuts, doesn’t say much but look sad.

Would never kill myself for my mom’s sake. But 3 times a week for four years I have been at the lowest lows, and I hide it so well every other moment, and I am exhausted.

I’m alive so my death doesn’t hurt anyone around me. I hide it so it doesn’t hurt anyone around me. There is no reward for not killing yourself every day. no thank you for spiraling by myself, cutting by myself, getting drunk by myself so no one sees. 

I am successful, pretty, young, happy, and loved. And the pain continues. I don’t think anyone will believe how crushing it is.

30,All my affairs are in order. Just wanted to say goodbye to internet strangers.,"Hi everyone.

Don't worry, I'm not looking for any help.  I'm only here to get this off my chest.  

31yr old male here in the U.S.  My fiancé had an affair, and took our 4year son.  I only get to see him on Wednesdays and every other weekend.  I'm a very ""all or nothing"" kind of person. Same as my parents. As shitty as this may seem, I'd rather be gone that deal with the pain. 

I've spent the last 5 months setting this up, and I'm completely come to terms with my decision.  I always plan ahead, and I have set up a trust account for my son, an email address for him, a 529 account for college, etc.  My Will & last testament has been completed, and letters have been written, all photos have been transferred to hard drive and my apartment packed up and cleaned (lease up in 3 months).  I was even able to cross a few things off my bucket list in the last few months which was nice.

I've got a very discrete spot picked out that me and some friends would go camping at in college, and I've gathered all materials. (A ridiculous amount of heavy pain pills, 3 bottles of prescribed codeine/promethazine cough syrup to prevent throwing up, my favorite alcohol, and old car, and a gun just in case.  A little extreme I know, but I'm not afraid of dying....I'm afraid of surviving. 

I just wanted to thank reddit for always being there.  I'll most likely be painlessly surfing reddit and listening to a few of my favorite songs in my last moments in my car waiting for the carbon monoxide to do its job.

4,The fact that suicidal ideation is so normalized makes it impossible to get help,"My friends joke about wanting to kill themselves constantly. “Haha if I get below a 60 on that test I’m actually gonna kill myself.” “Omg my new teacher makes me want to kill myself.” “My mom is so annoying I wanna die.” 

So every time I try to express that I’m genuinely suffering, they don’t take me seriously. It’s like everyone either thinks I’m an attention seeker or kidding. Even my psychiatrist just looks at me blankly, raises my medication dosage and says “try not to do anything until next week” every single session. The only reason I’m not dead yet is because I can’t find a reliable and minimally painful method.

I’ve been waiting for the right time and the right method but honestly I don’t even fucking care anymore. Next time I get the chance, I’m gone.

EDIT: 
First of all, thank you to everyone giving me support and awards! It genuinely means so much. You’re all such wonderful souls and I’m sending you all the love you need to get through whatever it is you’re going through :) <3

Secondly, I feel like this post is getting misconstrued a bit so I want to clear some things up. I totally get that I wasn’t very articulate - It was just sort of an angry vent and I didn’t imagine it would get so much attention. Anyway, My point in the original post is NOT that people aren’t allowed cope with humour - I even cope with humour myself sometimes. My point is that it’s frustrating that wanting to die has become the punchline to half of the jokes on the internet, so even when you’re trying to talk about being suicidal in a serious manner, people treat you as if you’re kidding. 

I also understand that absolutely no one’s obligated to listen to me. I always make sure that my friends are okay with me venting to them before I say anything even remotely emotional. If they’re not, I totally understand and they have every right to ignore me or tell me that they don’t feel comfortable with that. But responding to my “I’m struggling really bad right now” with a laugh and a joke is hurtful and unnecessary.

I also know that people might joke but actually be serious and coping through humour, but there’s just no need to turn what could be a meaningful conversation into a joke. If I come to someone about something and they respond with “I feel that way too, I’m sorry,” that’s absolutely valid. I have no issue at all with that. Just please don’t laugh at me. 

Anyways, hope you all have a great day. Keep fighting.",k5j3qa,1555,0.99,84,2020-12-02 21:40:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/k5j3qa/the_fact_that_suicidal_ideation_is_so_normalized/,False,False,2020,12

Yesterday night, around 3 am/4 am I was cutting myself in the bathroom... that was my 2° time doing it. My cat entered in. He looked at me with his pure and innocent eyes. 

I can't...

I started crying. I grabbed him and hugged him. Everytime I look at him, I think ""who will feed him if I'm not here? He would die"", ""I'm the only one who cares about him (my parents don't)"". So I promised to my cat (I KNOW that this is stupid) that I'll live just for him, and maybe I'll try get some friends/help...

15,Passive suicidal thoughts are taking over my life.,"I’m 21, just graduated from college, and I am so ready to stop existing. I think about suicide pretty much all day everyday.

20,I tried to hang myself today. I need a reason to not try again tomorrow.,"Woke up at noon. Stared at the ceiling, slept again, woke up again and stared at the ceiling for a while once more. Took a thick cloth belt from the closet, tied one end around the bookshelf, put the loop around my neck. 

First thing I noticed was the pressure. My face felt like it was pulsing and expanding, like I could feel myself turning red. Then a loud ringing in my ears drowning out everything else. Then choking and sputtering as I breathed in and couldn’t. Arms and legs spasmed, took a conscious effort to not reach for the belt. Twice I tried to die, but both times I couldn't help but struggle to ease the belt off my neck. Strangling myself made my being alive feel so much more immediate, which was nauseating compared to the dissociative sad stasis preceding my decision to die. Which is ironic because I had previously believed I'd want to be conscious when I die, but it would be so much easier to just slip away silently in my sleep or something. I now have petechial hemorrhage all over my face, and some on my neck. My throat perpetually feels like it has a lump in it. I have a persistent bad headache, nausea, I feel like I can't think more than one looping thought per minute, I can barely focus on any coherent train of thought nor input from the physical world. It has taken me hours to write this. Honestly, not a good time. 

This is not the first time I've tried to kill myself and frankly, I am seriously worried it won't be the last. Somehow I feel both like I want to end my life and also like I don't, and in those fleeting moments of unsuicidal lucidity (madness?) I try to find ways to save or at least prevent myself from what I might do. I've heard that stuff about people who survived jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge saying right after they jumped they realized all their problems were solvable and they shouldn't have jumped, but for me that wasn't really the case. After the second try didn't succeed I kinda just sat there for a while feeling nothing. It was oddly soothing, feeling totally blank when usually my mind and emotions spiral incessantly in a depressive pattern. I wasn't relieved to be alive, I felt no new resolve to live my life to the fullest or even at all, and most of all, the things that made me want to die are just as present and real as they were before I strung the belt around my neck. In fact, the biggest thing that made me decide to die feels itself immortal and unkillable:

Evil. The world is evil, pervasively and ubiquitously so. I have been on the receiving end of it in more ways and more times than I care to remember, and I know I've contributed to it through my own thoughts and actions. Yes there is beauty and love and joy in the world, and such things are real and important, but in my experience they are fickle and pale in comparison to the omnipotent, omnipresent capacity of human evil. They don't make life worthwhile to me, and it follows that I don't feel as though life is inherently worthwhile either. To find happiness is fortunate and fleeting, because evil is the backdrop, the default. You are guaranteed to find evil, and you never need to look far.

Since I was a child, I would cry for hours on end, heartbroken at the suffering and horror caused by the evil humans do to each other. Why do people suffer, and make others suffer? How can such a world, and a life in such a world be worthwhile? I am 25 now and in that regard, I haven't changed much at all. If anything, it's more unbearable now. I have searched my entire life for something to make it make sense. I've read novels and poetry, I've read and listened to various religious and spiritual teachings, I spent years studying philosophy, I've listened to and made music, I've seen and made art, I've talked to people who seem able to cope, desperately trying to find something to redeem this shithole of a world. And I'm still as empty handed as I was years ago, but it feels worse now because I'm surrounded by failed explanations and justifications and it feels like I've run out of new ones to consider. Being surrounded by the husks of failed answers to that eternal, painful question feels somehow more desolate than being in a void of none.

Frankly, I don't want to live in a world plagued by the sadistic, broken darkness of the human soul. It feels maudlin and perhaps naive to say that the bottomless evil of humanity is what made me decide to take my life, but it's the honest reason. And it's not going anywhere anytime soon. The final words of Nicolas Chamfort in his suicide note have always resonated with me: ""And so I leave this world, where the heart must either break or turn to lead."" 

Right now, I don't want to try and kill myself again. But I don't know what to do to make sure that doesn't happen. I don't know that I won't attempt it again tomorrow. It's highly unlikely that I'm going to have a transformative experience that reveals god and purpose that solves it all in the next few hours a la Cat Stevens or something. I feel that perhaps this is the kind of situation where one should check themselves into the hospital, but the thought of being isolated and constantly monitored for several days is straight up terrifying and sickening, on top of the worry of medical costs and not wanting to strain medical services further as they struggle in the current pandemic. I need an answer. I need something, anything that makes it less horrible. What makes life worth living, in spite of all the evil? How? How does anyone face this and manage to live, to find meaning in life, to wake up and feel like it's worth it? Why shouldn't I try to kill myself again, when evil springs eternal, when I contribute to it myself? Why should I try to go on living in an evil, broken, disappointing world?",kl157u,899,0.99,77,2020-12-27 09:54:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kl157u/i_tried_to_hang_myself_today_i_need_a_reason_to/,False,False,2020,12

Edit to Add:
Thank you for your support. My therapist deserves the time off (particularly from me) but is such a compassionate man, he has offered/insisted to still see me if I need to none the less but I’ll be damned if I’m going to bother him when he is so accomodating to me and always makes time to see me whenever I need. He is not the problem. 

I am taking this opportunity away from him while I will feel zero guilt and getting it “done” to stop this neverending hell of isolation, loneliness, severe depression, and zero social support likely to go on for another YEAR due to Covid. I had pretty severe issues pre-pandemic also.

I appreciate ever one of your comments, *all of you* who took time to say anything at all... I know many of you are in the same boat. I hooe you can all join together during this time to help each other. You are all the best.

I’ve reached a point of no return and uncovered levels of hopelessness I never knew possible. I’m unable to communicate directly with people at all at this point, I have not spoken to anyone except my therapist (also my psychiatrist) since March due to trust issues.

This sub has been so amazing and it continues to be. I’m sorry to disappoint, I just can’t...

30,I love my kitty,"I've been suicidal for years, but I got a cat a couple months ago in the middle of the worst time in my life and now I can't keep her anymore
While I was sewing yesterday my cat swallowed a sewing pin and now has to get surgery and my mom won't let me keep her anymore.
We can't afford her surgery so we had to call my father who is rich but also a drug addict and tried to rape me less than five months ago.
Ive been holding on just so I can take care of her and now I failed at that and will probably never see her again after today. I'll have no reason to live anymore.
edit: I fell asleep and my mom gave her to my dad while I was sleeping. i already feel so empty walking around the apartment without her.
edit 2: my cat is now out of surgery and will be staying with my father for 15-20 day for her recovery.

32,Police officer struggling with suicidal thoughts I cannot openly talk about.,"This is a throw-away but I intend on reading responses. I think I just mostly want to type and get things off my chest.

(TLDR; Who can I talk to about my strong desire to kill myself without there being an fear of repercussions?  Every outlet I find wants to know my location or my contact info before they'll talk to me.  I just want to call a suicide hotline who won't trace my call.)

I am 35 years old and live and work in Southern California as a Deputy for the last 10 years; I am no spring chicken.  My wife of 7 years and I have been struggling with infertility for 4 years now. lots of surgery and medication but no end in sight.  The stress of scheduled sex lives has absolutely taken a toll on us.  We're still very much in love, but its not the same.

In July of 2020 I had a fairly ""routine"" call involving child abuse that kind of pushed me over the edge. after the call I had a mental breakdown and I have been out of work since then.

I take 45mg a day of Buspar (my wife says it doesn't help me... I am not sure), Xanax as needed as prescribed by my DO (I originally took....alprazam? but had a rare side effect and had to stop).  He has asked that I see a psychiatrist but the next avail appointment is mid-January. 

I digress...

Because of my line of work, if I talk about suicide it can be... well... career suicide (no pun intended).  So I keep all these thoughts absolutely bottled up inside and have to act like I am not having them when my therapists asks about it.  My therapist is provided by work and specializes in law enforcement issues, which is nice at times.

I think about killing myself... hourly? I usually wake up 1-3 a night in the middle of a panic attack.  I cannot get away from this pain; its almost a physical pain. I have specific plans on how I would kill myself; the works.  I think about the entire process in detail often.  When I drink I usually come so close to actually doing it that I really fear its only a matter of time until it happens. Which is so ironic to type out.  Clearly I have reservations about killing myself when I am in the right state of mind... but when I am in the wrong state of mind it sounds like a realistic idea. I am physically exhausted from all of this I genuinely want the pain to end and I not seeing any answers on how to make it happen.

I want to talk to someone about this WITHOUT putting my job on the line (being put on a 5150 hold in CA means I cannot carry a gun and therefore... yeah...).  I am so heartbroken and frustrated I just don't know what to do anymore.  Every day seems like groundhog day.  I desperately want my wife to leave me because she deserves better; it would make it a lot easier to end my life if she hated me.  I have completely gotten rid of social media and blocked my parents out of my life for no really good reason.  What a downward spiral the last few months has been.

Who can I talk to about my strong desire to kill myself without there being an fear of repercussions?  Every outlet I find wants to know my location or my contact info before they'll talk to me.  I just want to call a suicide hotline who won't trace my call.  I really think I will end up killing myself within the next few months, but ironically I don't want to talk to anyone who might be able to stop me. This is so backwards.

Just typing this out if very exhausting and I might go to bed for the night.  Thank you for listening.",kfdi92,622,0.96,60,2020-12-18 03:52:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kfdi92/police_officer_struggling_with_suicidal_thoughts/,False,False,2020,12

34,Planning my suicide makes me feel almost euphoric,"I feel like I am completely losing my mind now. I have been dealing with so much resurfacing childhood trauma lately and I am dissociating heavily. Last night I went to bed praying for God to kill me in my sleep, and the thought of it actually happening made me feel so calm and content. I woke up multiple times during the night in complete panic and everytime I woke up I just started praying for God to kill me when I fall asleep again. 

I almost did it myself a few months ago, but I was able to resist the urge and stick around a little longer. I planned everything and I still have that exact same plan in my mind. I have the equipment and I can do it whenever, but I seriously am trying to fight the urge. It's tough. 

I felt better in the morning but during the day I have started to dissociate more and more, and right now as I am writing this, I have no clue what the fuck is even going on. I don't even know if what I'm writing makes sense, but I am trying my hardest. All I can think of right now is death. The thought of taking my own life gets me full of excitement and makes me feel almost complete euphoria. I held the rope in my hand today and just couldn't stop smiling. I tried tying the rope around my neck and adding a little pressure, and I loved the feeling of not being able to breathe and my ears starting to ring. Not being able to think. I have a red mark around my neck from it. I have been suicidal since I was a kid ( my mom even told me that she once found a suicide note I wrote when I was 7-8 years old ) but I have never been this close to actually doing it. I have swallowed some pills in the past but nobody knows about it and I know that I really wasn't ready to die back then so I wasn't trying seriously. 

The more the years pass, the more suicidal and unstable I become. Taking my own life doesn't feel like a fantasy anymore, it feels like a reality that is going to happen sooner or later. It doesn't even scare me in the slightest anymore, I have just come to accept it.",kn1ffx,597,1.0,47,2020-12-30 12:30:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kn1ffx/planning_my_suicide_makes_me_feel_almost_euphoric/,False,False,2020,12
35,My mom threw a knife at me.,"Context:  We were having an argument about consent. I always wear shorts at home and our house is pretty conservative and packed with family members, with a few older men such as my cousins and uncle. I always get anxious so I have this habit of bouncing my leg up and down. My mom scolded me about it multiple times, telling me to not do it because it means “attracting people to have sex with me” ( I am 16 by the way, the youngest in our household with the exception of my nephew). This time she was in a bad mood and unfortunately caught me bouncing my leg while wearing shorts which means my upper thigh is a bit shown. We were upstairs in the bedroom and she was using a small knife to cut off the straw from a box of groceries. The moment she caught me she fucking yelled at me saying that I was being a whore and stuff like that. I tried reasoning with her calmly and told her it was because I’m anxious about my school but she didn’t budge. She kept blabbering about what might happen if one my cousins or uncle saw what I was doing or the way I was dressed, they’d think I’m inviting them to have sex. I told her that just because I’m doing this does not mean I want to have sex because my neither my actions nor my clothing mean consent. She continued arguing about how they may be my relatives but they’re still “men” and added that she hopes I get raped so I’ll learn my lesson. I tried to counter one last time but then she fucking flung the knife right at me. She obviously missed on purpose but at that moment, my whole life fucking froze. She was fuming at me and said that next time I say things about consent and shit like that she won’t miss anymore.

Now, before I had been doing self harm and once even attempted to commit suicide. In those times, my mom was so hurt for me and kept telling me that my life mattered and all that shit. When I realized how much I was hurting her before I stopped no matter how depressive my state was. But now, my own fucking mother wanted me to die and hell, get raped. You know, I’m thinking, maybe I was right before. About just dying. Everyday I think about dying but I try so hard to stop myself from having these thoughts because I love my mama. But just when I’m starting to recover, my own mother wants me dead and literally fucking flung a knife at me. Sure, she missed but what if she didn’t? What if it didn’t kill me but left me fucking incapacitated? What if did really kill me? I was happy that I’m slowly getting better but right now, I might as well be better off gone.


Edit: Hi, so I just want to let you guys know that this was the first time I’ve ever talked about my problems at home. I don’t talk about it to literally anyone, even my friends and I do not have a therapist. I just wanna say thank you for all the support and I promise I’ll try my best to stay here. :D

Edit 2: Just wanna inform you guys that my mom has high blood pressure which might explain her explosive attitude but most certainly won’t excuse them. From now on, I’ll refrain from arguing with her for the sake of both of our health. Also, for everyone telling to hit up CPS, I appreciate your advices but our country’s CPS here is mostly for juveniles (correct me of I’m wrong) and like, rebellious kids I think and kinda treats them badly so I don’t think they’d do my mental health any better. Strange as it may be, my mom is the only parent I have left since my dad’s out the picture (another reason why I stopped trying to kill myself, I didn’t want my mom to be alone). She’s all I have right now and basically, all I can do right now is try to keep things as smooth as possible to avoid any more trouble in the future.",kg6ta5,526,0.98,99,2020-12-19 12:20:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kg6ta5/my_mom_threw_a_knife_at_me/,False,False,2020,12

37,"My BF thinks suicidal people are all weak, cowards and he has zero empathy for anyone who either wants to, attempts to, or has committed suicide (spoiler alert: I am sometimes suicidal)","This is really just a rant I have to get off my chest. I don’t even care of no one reads it. 

So quick background: I was clinically diagnosis with major depression, general anxiety disorder and OCD two years ago. Things got so bad I had my first psychosis episode and was hospitalized. I didn’t believe I had any of those illnesses and initially thought the doctors were all stupid and diagnosing me with BS. But at the encouragement of my boyfriend (who I live with) and parents, also later realizing myself the doctors were probably right - upon discharge, I agreed to obtain outpatient services and have been treated ever since with weekly psychotherapy and daily medication.

Flash forward two years - I’m much better - no longer having suicidal thoughts, can hold down a job again, intrusive thoughts are much less frequent and am starting to feel joyful again. 

One of the suggestions of my therapist was to try to communicate with my boyfriend more - it’s clear that we have some major unresolved conflicts and that may be a part of the reason why I have stress, depressive thoughts, and/or unhealthy anxiety. So I’ve been trying to have more conversations so we can work through major disagreements - but of course my boyfriend is resistive and isn’t fond of difficult conservations. (I mean, who is?)

I won’t go through every disagreement lol this would be a novel. But one of the biggest one came up (again) last night. I mentioned (off hand) that I’m glad I don’t have suicidal thoughts anymore. 

__Him:__ erm...that’s good but you had no reason to have suicidal thoughts in the first place.

__Me:__ well first of all I did have reasons...secondly I literally couldn’t control those thoughts - they were intrusive and I couldn’t not have them. 

__Him:__ can we not talk about suicide or bad/negative thoughts? I’m really uncomfortable with this topic. 

__Me:__ ok I know but that’s why I haven’t talked to you about this pretty much ever - and I haven’t even brought up suicide in two years with you.

__Him:__ ok so why bring it up now?

__Me:__ because you’re my partner you said we can talk to each other about everything. Also earlier you said you’re 100% emotionally supportive but I can’t talk to you about mental health and negative thoughts?

__Him:__ I _am _completely supportive but some topics are off limits for some people.

__Me:__ but this is important to me and a part of my recovery process is to talk to close loved ones about my mental health - my parents and most of my close friends also are uncomfortable with this, so you’re one of the few people left I could talk to.

__Him:__ so now your mental health is _my_ responsibility?

__Me:__ no I never said that, but you’re just not a supportive partner if you refuse to even let me say one word about it.

__Him:__ What? So now you’re judging me and calling me a bad partner because I don’t want to talk about a very sensitive topic??

__Me:__ well not in those exact words but... kinda.

__Him:__ Excuuuuse me??? After all we went through? After everything I did for you for the past few years? Cooking for you? Trying to calm you down? After me being supportive the whole time in the hospital and even after?? _I’m_ a bad partner?!

__Me:__ well actually two years ago you actively discouraged me from going to the hospital and said “there’s nothing wrong with you you’re not depressed.”

__Him:__ _how_ could I have known??!! I’m not a doctor!!

__Me:__ you could have encouraged me to go see one?

__Him:__ I thought you were just having a bad day!

__Me:__ I had a bad 12 months and I said I’m not sad I’ve had highly negative thoughts for over 6 months. I told you this before I was diagnosed.

__Him:__ Again, I didn’t know that was a cause for concern.

__Me:__ what about now? You’ve supposedly learned a lot about mental health in the last couple years you say - if a friend of yours told you they’ve been feeling depressive  for 6 months, would you encourage them to go see a doctor?

__Him:__ I don’t know. Depends on who.

__Me:__ Bob (good friend of his, not his real name)

__Him:__ umm probably not, Bob’s a pretty positive person and probably just having a bad period with work or something.

__Me:__ so...you wouldn’t even recommend he talks to a doctor. What’s the harm in that?

__Him:__ I’m not a doctor, and it’s his responsibility to go see one.

__Me:__ but you can at least be a supportive friend.

__Him:__ _How_ am I not supportive?

__Me:__ earlier you said I can talk to you another _anything._ I guess not actually _anything._

__Him:__ of course you can talk to me about anything, _ANYthing_ and _EVERYthing_ in the whole world!

__Me:__ except negative thoughts and suicide?

__Him:__ WHY do you want to talk to me about suicide? WHY? Are you suicidal right now? Do I need to take you to the hospital again?

__Me:__ uhh no...this whole conservation started with me saying I don’t really have those thoughts anymore.

__Him:__ So WHY are you talking about it THEN???

__Me:__ because my doctor said it’s important to talk about past trauma and talking about what it was like for me to be in a downward spiral. It helps me get even better.

__Him:__ ....

__Me:__ so...can I talk about bad thoughts and suicide?

__Him:__ ...

__Me:__ ok so two years ago I really wanted to kill myself.

__Him:__ see right there you lost me. Why? You had no reason to - you were a really positive person and super resilient to challenges you could work through anything.

__Me:__ it was an intrusive thought I couldn’t control. 

__Him:__ do you have suicidal thoughts right now?

__Me:__ no.

__Him:__ then stop talking about it. Talk to me when you do have suicidal thoughts. Then I’ll take you to the hospital.

__Me:__ okay...can I talk to you about negative thoughts that are not suicidal?

__Him:__ no because you should be talking to a medical professional.

__Me:__ okay but my appointment is not for another week, it would make me feel better if I talked to someone now.

__Him:__ you want to know my opinion? __Suicidal thoughts and actions are a sign of weakness. And i _despise_ weakness. It’s wrong and I have no empathy, zero empathy for those types of thoughts or actions.__

__Me:__ actually I’d didn’t ask for your opinion. I want you to listen to me talk about my experiences and just listen like a supportive partner would. You don’t have to give any thoughts or opinions. But since you did - so you think I’m weak, you despise me and I deserve no empathy?

__Him:__ no I didn’t say that.

__Me:__ ok so - you despise all weak suicidal people except me?

__Him:__ no you’re putting words in my mouth.

__Me:__ literally what you said.

__Him:__ see? This is why I didn’t want to talk about it. 

__Me:__ okay I get it. Talk to you about anything - except for negative mental health topics.

__Him:__ No!!! I never said that!!!

Anyway this went on for a while. Then I of course got angry and annoyed and said some not nice stuff I didn’t mean. As of this morning he is still mad at me. And just now he said - I harassed him all night, was cruel, intentionally tried to hurt him by calling him not supportive and trying to blame my depression on him. Also I need to learn to drop things, know what types of topics to not bring up with someone but oh btw - I can talk to him about _anything._

__Me:__ so can i talk to you about suicide now?

__Him:__ OMG! When someone says “you can talk to me about anything” you should know to just say “ok, thanks.” You’re not supposed to IMMEDIATELY bring up something they ALREADY said they’re uncomfortable talking about!

__Me:__ lol.

I’ve suggested couples counselling to him many times, and for years. He refuses. He says the problem is almost 100% with me and I’m the only one who needs counselling.

Honestly - suicidal thoughts from two years ago - mostly caused by being a horrible work place with a terrible boss, along with arguing with an unsupportive partner at home, with my parents who are also verbally abusive and dismissive of my health concerns, and only one friend who even remotely believed I was depressed. Plus some other stuff I wasn’t conscious of and couldn’t control.

I know at the end of the day my mental health is no one else’s responsibility and it’s up to me to seek help and treatment - which I did - I was the first person to think to go to the hospital initially even though I was skeptical. But I’d ideally just like a friend or family I’m close with who I can talk to about this stuff on occasion. But I guess you can’t always depend on that. Strangers on the internet sometimes will - but it’s still nice to have someone you’re already close with be supportive of you. 

For anyone who wants to say - you should just break up with your boyfriend. Let me just tell you that’s not the first option. We’ve been together for more than 10 years, living together for most of that time, and are common law which is legally the same as married in my country (i.e. may need lawyers to help split). Plus i know for a fact because of this pandemic and loss of hours at work - he can’t afford to live on his own. For me, I could move in with my parents - but they’re sometimes very abusive and it could be an even worse situation for me to be in. 

Anyway rant over. Sorry that was so long. __tl;dr__ just read the title lol. Thanks for listening.",kgaidi,487,0.97,136,2020-12-19 16:11:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kgaidi/my_bf_thinks_suicidal_people_are_all_weak_cowards/,False,False,2020,12

39,I've grown to despise life and people.,"I'm Thirty-seven. I have autism the supposed high functioning kind but that's a load of shit. There is no such thing. There's fucked and slightly less fucked.

The cherry on top? It was preventable. My 'wonderful' mother couldn't stop puffing her cancer sticks for nine months. So I get a lifetime subscription to the shit show that is my brain.

It gets better though. In gradeschool I was abused. My lovely aunt and grandmother buried it because , I don't know. Reasons. This escalated my behavioral issues in school and at home immensely. Rage doesn't even begin to describe it.

.

School was boring as hell. I had autisim I wasn't retarded. But the lovely school system couldn't tell the difference. So I was stuck in Special Ed, not being challenged at all. By all rights I should've been three grades above where I was. Public schools like uniformity. Different is anathema to them.

So my second year of middle school I said fuck it and quit going. I wasn't getting anything out of it anyway. Contrary to what most adults and parents think...you can't make a child do anything they don't want to do. They tried to make me go back. I refused. When my father hit me with the belt I called the police on him.

It was the last time that ever happened.

At fifteen or sixteen I got my highschool deploma from a by mail school. Mostly out of spite. It was a waste of time and money.

My general anexity and inability to be what society deems normal kept me from getting a job. Well almost.

I worked for the family construction business starting at age 15 to 21 where I had wrecked my back. 0/10. Would not recommend. Money was great however it destroyed my developing body. I suffer from chromic pain now. Which on good days can be described as an icepick twisting in my hip and a baseball bat smashing into my back...and on bad sees me unable to walk from my bedroom to the bathroom without suffering from muscle spasms.

I digress.

At twenty-five(I think)  I moved across the entire US to get away from them. With my then girlfriend/fiance. In retrospect it was a doomed relationship. While I cared for her my desire to get away from my family mattered more. I had grown to hate them.

I had to come home two years later due to irreconcilable differences. I left again a short time later to be with another girl. At age thirty no less. I've been with this one since. If not for the disability laws we'd be married now.

My life had finally come together. We moved back to help tend to my ailing father. Stage four cancer. It was in 'remission'. or supressed. Whatever they do to keep it undercontrol.

I was healthier. Until I was forced to deal with my toxic wastedump of a family again.

My mother hated my 'wife' and mother inlaw. She resented me for not being there to help with my father. (Yeah fuck you too bitch.) When he first took ill. Mm. She made no secret of that in how she treated me.

In the amidst of all that my grandmother, one who helped raise me...and also swept the abuse under the rug. Died.

When I finally confronted my mother and aunt...my aunt claimed no such thing ever happened to me. So the options are casual indifference or malicious stupidity. The rage I had came back two fold.

Luckily I lived across town. I could be there for my dad...help get him to this appointments and visit...yet I was isolated enough that I didn't have to deal with the excess family shit I tried to escape.

Until 2020.

In this godawful hellscape of a year... I lost my uncle in july. He was one of two male rolemodels I had. He helped instill morals in me and helped raise me.

I lost my house(A rental), because the phrase 'caregiver' went in one ear and out the other. My priority was my dad. So sometimes the lawn wouldn't be cut as often as they would like. Or sometimes the house wouldn't be as clean. Sorry I have priorities. The shitbag landlord told us the neighborhood was becoming gentrified and he wouldn't be renewing our lease at the end of the year.

So unpleasantly I had to move back home with my wife and mother in law. Where my mother finds fault in everything.

Lovely.

A month after I move in my father dies.

Its at this juncture I begin to despise pretty much everyone and everything. I could not, in my wildest dreams imagine life being this goddamned cruel. I thought I'd get another year with him. Instead I got a middle finger.

A week or so before his birthday.

Then the petty fights started over bullshit. They are too numerous to even bother recounting here. Everyday some minor drama.

As if that wasn't enough... One of the kittens I hand raised and tamed had to be put to sleep due to cancer. After I spent 350 dollars I didn't fucking have to try and save her life. It wasn't my cat though. It was my dads. So another kick in the nuts.

This has been my life for the last three months. One blow after another with selfish ignorant people who continue to be absolute douchebags. Fighting over inconsequential shit that no sane person would give a damn about.

The cat dying was the last straw for me. I went off my meds. I was tried of playing peace keeper or being 'the man of the house.'

If I'm going to be miserable, I'm going to be miserable. I'm not going to keep pumping chemical bullshit into me to give me an artificial happy only to have it destroyed by selfish ignorant fucks.

TO make matters worse, the constant snark directed at my wife has her in such a state she doesn't want to do anything. So cleaning, the litterboxes all of it falls on me now. This enviroment is destroying  the one healthy relationship I have. I'm growing to hate her too.

Oh did I mention I'm a firearm owner? I had to stay away from them for years until I trusted myself enough to use them responsibly again. The entire experience has destroyed that. I can't even enjoy one of the few hobbies my dad and I shared.

Years of healing unraveled in a few short months.

I'm a prisoner inside my own mind(And home it feels like)  half the time and the other half Well....I'm getting yelled at for leaving to go buy mcdonals at 11 at night or treated like I'm still a child because apperently I'm supposed to ask permission before leaving.. HAHAHA No.

I've just about had my fill of other peoples bullshit. Though don't mistake me. I'm far too spiteful to actively harm anyone but myself. See if I opt out of this, the people who did nothing but make me miserable will have the guilt of my suicide on their minds. That thought alone makes me smile.

I find myself looking at my dad's 1911 which I carry everyday...wondering why I don't stick the thing in my mouth and pull the trigger.

Even at my lowest I used to have reasons why I wouldn't. Now the reasons why I should vastly out weigh the reasons why I shouldn't.

Now that I have the text here, looking at it... I suppose the only reason I haven't is I'm not convinced the damn thing would actually kill me. The way this shitfuck of a year has gone I'd survive and be wheelchair bound or more mentally damaged than I already am.  There's always the shotgun I suppose...but it doesn't have the same sense of poetic irony to it.

So yeah. Merry Christmas to me.

3,"Just been notified that the cancer in my dad has spread and that he is about to die. I dont want to be an orphan. I lost my mom to cancer five years ago, my uncle in december 2020 and half my family is already dead. I cant. I will kill myself when he dies. Tha pain is too much. Not again.","In 2015 I lost my mom in a heartbreaking battle against leukemia and only refrained of killing myself, because my dad and friends were there. At the beginning of 2020 my Dad started another cancer treatment over the course of several months, just after finishing one treatment before. After the treatment, the tumor was removed and he had other complications afterwards which were resolved over Christmas. But he came back weakened and underweight from the hospital. Then he we got infected with Covid-19. Today he was picked up by an ambulance, because he got weaker and weaker. When I spoke with the Doctor over the phoned, he mentioned that the cancer has spread and that they can only stop its spreading even further - something my Dad kept secret from me. It all makes sense now. He suddenly started buying me expensive presents, despite me not wanting them, stopped talking about next Christmas and suddenly mentioning back up plans and so on. Even the thought alone makes me want to rip out my heart, as the pain is paralysing my body and mind. I dont want to be alone. I no longer have friends. My Aunt is old and sick aswell. My Uncle just died of Covid. Why is everyone dying in my family. I cant anymore. My family is small and taken so fast.

This is it. When he dies I will kill myself as I am about to be alone and that thought freightens me. Only my memories will remain of a happier time and even those a fading.

5,"My wife committed suicide, i want to follow her","We got into an argument in early 2020 and it came to light she had cheated on me, and wanted to again. I couldn’t forgive but because i already had depression and knew that i decided to start taking medication because I have never cared about any one or thing half as much as I cared about her.

By December we had both tried to take our lives multiple times and after she found me overdosed in our apartment she promised me she wouldn’t kill herself so I promised i wouldn’t try again. But she had to travel for work and found out she was pregnant while away. 

She immediately canceled the trip and came home to have an abortion but got quarantined and i don’t even remember how many days into quarantine before we had an argument and i wasn’t staying there because i needed to be able to bring her food, the last thing my reason for living said was she wasn’t going to mill herself but wanted to sleep, i said ok. Then she wouldn’t respond realized she was in a dark place and went there as fast as i could but in 20 minutes she had died.

I gave her cpr and called everyone who could help hoping i could save her but felt her body go cold under my hands but i was stupid and hopeful i couldn’t be anything else in the moment, the paramedics got her heart started but she was gone already, i didn’t know and spent the next two nights sleeping in the lobby waiting for news then got told harshly by a nurse who didn’t know that I didn’t know she was legally dead already and i tried hitting my head into a wall to die but all i got was a split skull and a dislocated wrist. Was under suicide watch for a time was there when my wife passed but am not on such tight suicide watch anymore and am trying not to care about how everyone else feels but just kill my self.

i dont know if I should before or after her funeral.


Add on, the last thing her parents said was I killed her and that i hurt her memory by living as a liar saying i was ever good to her. I made videos for my family and friends to explain I don’t want them to be blamed, i have a lot of benzodiazepines left from being in the hospital, and got a bottle of vodka.

As in, I wanna kill myself most days, but I only ever brought it up when I wanted attention and affection and people didn't want to give it. I've ruined plenty a relationship and friendship that way, no sense in doing it again. It makes them so sad, and hurt, and afraid when I tell them, and usually they can't do anything anyway.

11,Being disabled has ruined my life,"I’m pretty badly autistic, I have dyspraxia/dyslexia/dyscalculia, I have ADHD, I got the neurological full house when I was born it seems. My parents (divorced and separated) used to abuse me (independently of one another as they didn’t talk), it got to the point where my mom was trying to murder me for quite a while. This left me severely mentally I’ll. Boarderline personality disorder, skitzo-affective disorder, bipolar 1, and C-PTSD. I’ve been assessed 3 times so each doctor has a slightly different opinion, but those are the words they chose to diagnose me with. Irregardless of what they say, the symptoms are absolute hell. Delusions, rapid violent mood swings, auditory and visual hallucinations, I hear voices, fully immersive flash backs of my trauma, break downs, anxiety attacks, self-harm (I do it automatically in my sleep), night terrors, lack of self-control, black outs, lack of impulse control. I could go on. It has crippled my life. I have no job. No family. No friends. I have my dog and a collection of ant colonies. What kind of life is this? What kind of future do I have waiting for me? I get worse every year, how long does my mind have left? Will I ever find love? Will I ever have friends? I just don’t know. I don’t want to die, I just don’t want to be trapped inside of this system anymore. I worry that one day I won’t even be aware I’ve killed myself because I won’t have been present during the moment that event carries out. It’s a very strange fear to have to carry around - looking over your shoulder, looking for yourself. Some times I think death would be a mercy. I just don’t know what the future holds, all I know is that I’m trying. I’m trying to be a good person. I’m trying to be likeable. I’m trying to be funny. I’m trying to be loveable. I’m trying to be human. I’m trying to make something of myself. I just wish that I hadn’t been given Mt. Everest on my first Rodeo.

13,My gf made an attempt,"She has had the toughest life of anyone I've ever known, and yet she's the kindest, most loving person I've ever known. We fit together in so many ways we've never come close to before. We make each other feel normal when the rest of the world does the opposite.

Recently, her anxiety skyrocketed, and she had been a bit more receptive to discussing getting some help (past trauma included incidents related to therapy and psych treatment). I asked again Wednesday night when she started getting antsy again after a calm, positive day. She said she would ""get there,"" she would be ready soon.

Her anxiety spiked a little later that night, and she got upset with me over a very minor misunderstanding. It threw me at first, but I realized it was her anxiety talking and did what I could to help her calm down. The anxiety didn't seem as bad at it had been in nights leading up to that.

We snuggled up in bed and went to sleep. I woke up in the night and noticed she was very tightly holding onto me. She didn't move much when I got up, just kinda rolled over. Same thing when I came back to bed.

I got up for work later, and she apologized for being mean the night before. I apologized for not realizing what was going on at first. Nothing seemed amiss, but she's tough, and mornings are hectic.

She sent the usual sweet message while I was on my way in. Then right after my work day started (and she knew I couldn't get messages for a while), she messaged that she needed to be committed. When I got the message, I asked if she was in danger and messaged our trusted friends near the house. She had reached out to them already, and they were there.

They took her to the ER, she went from there to inpatient.

She took 2500 mg of benadryl. I'm not sure how she woke up. She didn't mean to wake up.

The misunderstanding and everything happened later the night before, and she took the pills before that.

Anyway. She has been receiving inpatient treatment for a couple days. She just got cleared to receive the clothes I dropped off her first night in there. She got a fork at dinner tonight.

We've been able to talk a handful of times. She sounds better and more hopeful each time. I'm so proud of her for finally agreeing to get the help she needs, and I cannot fathom how hard this is for her.

Due to COVID restrictions, no one can have visitors, so she has short phone calls, and she has the photos and books I dropped off. And she has time. She is doing the work and going to sessions and everything (confirmed by her nurses). She is feeling hopeful. She said she was really happy about today.

I'm so glad she's getting help. I know she's in good hands. The facility she's at is local, and I have friends who gave family who've been greatly helped by then, too. I'm also feeling lost being less than a mile from her but unable to give her a hug or even look into her eyes.

We have a small but tight support network of friends, and I don't feel like harming myself. I just don't feel like doing anything other than calling her. 

Sorry if this is the wrong sub. I looked a bit and couldn't find a better fit, and I needed to get this out there.

Update: I just got word that she's been cleared to come home. She has medications to be picked up at the pharmacy, and she has follow up sessions scheduled.

I can't thank you all enough for the kindness and support you've sent our way here. Each night of this has been rough, but last night felt particularly miry. I posted here because, although I have good friends whom I can talk to admit this, and who came through the other day and got her to help while I was gone, I felt a need to just say the story to people who didn't know, who don't know, what was going on or don't know us, etc.

I am so happy she is coming home, and I am so hopeful for the future. I know the struggle is not over, and it's one that will likely go on as long as we're alive (just like my own struggles with mental health), but I am supremely optimistic at the change in her demeanor and her willingness to continue on the path to health and happiness. Together.

My family is okay, had some arguing here and there but nothing abusive. I'm currently in uni with decent grades but also a whole lot of stress.

I've had suicidal thoughts for at least 8 years now, most of the times they come and go, but recently I've been starting to feel like things are pointless. I don't want to end up in a low paying job in this broken economy, doing the same thing from day till night, rinse and repeat. I hate having to deal with expectations of people and myself. I hate feeling like a fucking failure who can't get a job because of volatile emotions. I hate dealing with people who expect everything but pay you sheckels.

I don't see the point of carrying on anymore. Sure, there will be good times, but even during the good times I can't feel anything anymore. All I can feel is just neutral or depressed, and all I can do is pretend to be alright, all smiles, maybe play a fucking idiot to put on the act that all is well and I'm an upbeat cheerful person, or I'll just get into more trouble and even more depression. I feel like nobody I talk to will understand, and the people I've talked to all just say ""I've been through worse and I'm fine"", and I'm sick and tired of hearing that.

I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to fall into a coma, but that won't happen anytime soon. Sometimes I just wish my brain wasn't this volatile and would take a chill pill, but a therapist is out of the option since they're very expensive and because of the whole covid situation.

I don't want to be a burden to anyone anymore. But I don't know what to do.

I don't know. Thank you for reading though. Deep down I still wish that everything will be okay, even though I hate holding on to false hope.

22,I really really don’t want to but I don’t know what to do,"I’m not sure this is an appropriate subreddit for me to post in about this. 

I don’t want to die or end my life but I feel like I don’t have another option. I constantly think about it. I just want to be free and released. 

I am 30F. My parents are in their mid to late 60s. I lost my job back in March because of corona. My mother had a stroke last year and needs constant help with everything. She’s also always been codependent. My father has Parkinson’s and is getting worse slowly. He has always been and continues to be belligerent, verbally and light physical abuse. I am the oldest of 3. My siblings also live at home but one is physically disabled and one is very mentally ill. 

I barely get 5 hours of sleep everyday. I constantly go back and forth between taking care of my mom and dad and brother (mentally ill disabled). All bills are on me. Our house is at risk for foreclosure. The house is in my fathers name and I can’t do much because of that. I can’t get him to stand long enough to go to the dmv to renew his ID so he can go to a notary. 

I also have an auto immune disease that degenerates your spine slowly but thankfully it’s very slow and I’m still able to do a lot just with chronic pain. I just wish so badly that I can just live for myself. I want to wake up and just solve my own problems. Worry about only myself and feeding myself etc. I’ve never had a chance to live life for myself. I’ve had to help my parents since I was a teenager. 

I can only see things getting better once my parents both die but that’s not happening for at least 15 years. I love my mother and don’t want her to die or feel like a burden. She’s trying to do physical therapy and recover. I get so jealous when I see other people my age just being their age. Living on their own, only having to worry about themselves. Only cooking for themselves. Able to do self care and able to go to work. Even if I got a job I will probably lose it because I would have to call out a lot to take care of my family. 

We cannot afford a home health aid. I’ve tried with the insurance they won’t cover it. I’ve tried to get paid as my mothers home health aid; they won’t cover that. I have constant anxiety. I just want to be able to worry about my own problems and take care of myself. I just want my own life. If I’m lucky maybe I’ll be able to start living when I’m almost 50 years old. 

I don’t want to commit suicide because I know of the beauty in life. I know it’s possible for me to be happy. I just don’t see a way out alive right now. I didn’t know where else to post. Anywhere else I’ve posted I haven’t had any replies. If you’ve read this, thank you. I wish you a good 2021. 

I appreciate any replies.


EDIT: I just wanted to edit this post in case anyone checks back. First off, thank you so much for all of the awards and replies. The response has overwhelmed me and made me feel less alone. I hate that other people are going through what I am but it makes me feel like I am not alone. 

Second, just to answer a few common replies. My family has been through social security and disability. My parents are literally dollars over the line set by the government for SNAP and other assistance. We have been denied many times. My sister receives disability but it took many denials and paying a lawyer in order to get it. It’s also a very small amount. My brother was also denied and a lawyer says mental health disabilities are harder to get approved. If anyone has info or has been through getting disability for mental health reasons (my brother has schizophrenia), please reach out to me.  

Recently we applied for disability for my mother and she was denied because of my father’s pension and not having enough working credits. My mom turns 62 in June so we are looking forward to her early basic social security and maybe being able to get her on Medicare. Her private insurance through my dads old work (he’s retired) doesn’t cover paying me as a home health aid or even hiring a professional home health aid. I am hoping that’s something I can do through Medicare when my mom can get it.


My father recently got Medicare but after doing a screening with a nurse and everything they say he doesn’t qualify to pay for a home health aid. My father has his good days still and loves to hide his abusive and weak side. I tried to get my father into a nursing home but he doesn’t meet the criteria. In may my father stayed at a inpatient rehab after a fall, for about 2 weeks. I told the social worker all the issues going on. I told the doctor who asked why he was on psych meds, that he was abusive and I didn’t want him to come home. That I didn’t want to and couldn’t care for him AND my mother. That his moods were unstable. The doctor offered nothing, wouldn’t even change his meds or offer a plan for discharge. No one flinched at me saying I can’t care for him or that he’s abusive. They simply didn’t see it as their problem to help. Even the social worker. 

I have tried getting snap benefits for myself but because I live with my parents they’re included in the household. I also forgot to mention I live just outside of NYC. So our mortgage is very expensive as you can imagine. 

I am sorry if I rambled. I’m trying to get out and remember all of the details. The most important thing I have to say is THANK YOU. To everyone that awarded, replied, messaged, and even just read my post. I promise you I am NOT going to kill my self. I don’t have plans or ever make or think about plans. I just felt hopeless and felt like no one else was listening.

1,i drank bleach,"i attempted suicide 8 to 7 hours ago, by drinking bleach. not exactly an ideal experience, i wasn’t put into inpatient because of covid luckily (not for covid, but me being able to go home) my throat burns, and i cant taste anything. i also vomited a lot... i also had to drink some horrible white medicine that numbed my intestines. it was a very long process. my doctor also made me promise not to drink bleach anymore, and rather something more tasty like the gatorade that i had next to me. (made me smile) it feels horrible though when your plan doesn’t succeed and instead you have to deal with the consequences. i really don’t feel like attending school, or doing anything right now. i’m not going to lie, i do feel a bit better after my attempt (emotionally, not physically, i’m still in a bit of discomfort and pain) i do think i’m getting my medicine dosage higher. my friends probably didn’t even notice my absence, i wish i could tell someone how much i’m struggling. but it’s not like i could just pour all this information on someone who has no clue about this... it’s just horrible. i’m just going to sleep off the dreadful feelings. anyone thinking of drinking bleach 0/10 dont recommend, you will feel horrible.",lr6oqf,1536,0.99,152,2021-02-24 07:27:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lr6oqf/i_drank_bleach/,False,False,2021,2

3,I hate the misconception that people who are suicidal don't think about how their family and friends will be impacted.,"I've had several people bring this up to me when I've opened up to them about my suicidal thoughts and honestly I'm tired of hearing it. I know I've thought about my family's reactions a lot when I've been considering a plan for killing myself, so I'm tired of people thinking that we're all just selfish for being suicidal. Not only did I put heavy consideration into my family's reaction, I also thought they probably just wouldn't care or would be better off without me even if they did care. Depression and suicidal thoughts can literally warp your thinking and make it hard to think rationally about these types of things. 
I don't personally think that people who have never been suicidal have any right trying to shame us or make us feel guilty for being this way when I'm sure most of us would do anything to enjoy life and not want to die.",lqpncu,1376,0.99,88,2021-02-23 18:42:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lqpncu/i_hate_the_misconception_that_people_who_are/,False,False,2021,2

Mental health support reminds me of this post I saw a year or so ago:

>That's the thing about any of these people they get to talk to you; therapists, counselors, any of them. There is a limit to how much of your issues you're allowed to show before you're deemed out of hand. They can handle the conventional issues that they were taught in Psych 1 but anything beyond that gets you thrown in a mental cell and a combination of pills shoved down your throat.

I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to keep a full time job. I feel like I’m just weak and not made for this world. In school, we learned about how the less adapted animals don’t make it, and I feel like I’m one of those. Everything feels foggy right now. I think I’m the guy in the neighborhood that everyone talks about. I’m the one who did fine in school but it just didn’t pan out. I’m my sister’s alcoholic brother (I’ve been sober for a while, but still). I’m my parents’ son who never left the nest. I don’t know how long I can keep up this “everything is okay. I’ll tough it out” act for. If I just stopped existing today, I’d be fine with it. Best case, I move on to something new in an afterlife. Worst case, there’s nothingness so at least this pain would stop. I know I’d be missed, but I feel like they’d get over it. Eventually, I’d just be a distant memory. I don’t know how I’ll ever get to 30 or if I even want to.

Edit 1: still no reply from them. It’s been ~10 hours since I’ve first reached out to them. I was able to find what I assume their address. Attempted to call their local PD for a welfare check but they are closed on the weekends. No social media of theirs was found.

20,It’s so fucking frustrating that so many people that have zero experience with mental illness think they know what constitutes an “attention seeker” vs “reaching out”,"When I start panicking, I can’t think straight at all, and I start reaching out for support in any way I can. If my therapy wasn’t helpful to me the day prior, no shit I’m going to reach out to people other than him if I’m really upset. All help lines ive tried are also shit, so I’ve resorted to reaching out online and sometimes to people I know in real life. 

Sometimes when I’m panicking I’ll tell someone that I want to kill myself in the hopes that they’ll respond with something that will make me feel better. Usually I’m told that I’m looking for attention, because if I really wanted to kill myself id just do it right? 

Half of the day I feel like screaming out that I want to kill myself so someone will make me feel better and make me not want to kill myself. I know the reaction I’ll get though. I wish people would use their brains and think through what it might be like to be someone with a  severe mental illness, it’s fucking torture. Like yes, we we don’t deserve to be put on a pedestal above you obviously, but maybe we do deserve a little special treatment, to be told that we deserve to live, to be given support, a hug, anything. You owe it to someone if they’re struggling and they reach out to you to not be an asshole and to give them at least an ounce of support",lh2wux,688,0.99,33,2021-02-10 20:25:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lh2wux/its_so_fucking_frustrating_that_so_many_people/,False,False,2021,2

25,I'm so embarrassed that I genuinely am considering suicide.,"First of all: I know I am overreacting, that's what I'm excepting to hear in the replies. So, don't worry, I know. I just want to make it clear that I am diagnosed with Severe Anxiety and I cannot handle embarrassment at all. I normally wouldn't go as far as to say I want to kill myself, but this is a different occasion. 

\[Little NSFW Warning\]

&#x200B;

Last night, I had decided to try masturbation for the first time, normally, I am absolutely revolted by even the thought of it, I am convinced I am Asexual, but I don't want to be. I want to be a normal teenage girl. So, I desperately tried it in hopes it would unlock my ability to feel sexual desire and attraction. I didn't get too far in, being very, VERY hesitant, when my Mom barged in my room to check if I was asleep. I hear her yell ""WHAT WERE \*YOU\* DOING?"", her loud reaction caused my little sister to rush in and also see me, and I'll save the other details.

&#x200B;

We talked after that, and I told her my story of how I was only trying it because I was scared I couldn't feel any sexual feelings, I wish I had've come out as Ace to her right there and then, but I was worried she'd think it was fake. She was so very kind about it, telling me what I tried was normal and that I shouldn't be ashamed that I don't want to do anything like that, and that it was okay. 

&#x200B;

But ever since then, I've been so depressed. It embarrassed me so much, my little sister won't look me in the eyes anymore, and I've felt like utter shit around my mother. I feel so sick that that's forever going to be in her memories, and that she will probably never see me as the innocent girl I expressed I was. The embarrassment and knowing that I cannot change the past weighs me down so much that I just want to fucking kill myself so I don't have to deal with it anymore. I can't sit on my bed without remembering it. This has genuinely made me want to kill myself, and again, I know I'm overreacting. I've tried telling myself that in a few months, maybe even just ***a*** month that this won't matter, but it doesn't work. I feel sick. I don't want to leave my room anymore, I don't want to eat, I don't want to take showers anymore, I don't want to care for myself anymore, because I'm afraid she'll think I'm doing it again (even though I expressed to her that the thought of it was repulsing.)

&#x200B;

I'm sorry, I know no one cares about my weird story, I just wanted to get it off my chest and also ask if anyone knows any tactics to forget memories quicker. Could I just pretend it was a dream? I don't want to feel like this anymore.",liuy9r,628,0.98,59,2021-02-13 06:23:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/liuy9r/im_so_embarrassed_that_i_genuinely_am_considering/,False,False,2021,2

30,My partner tried to kill herself yesterday,"It has been a tough few weeks. 

About a month ago my partner of 20 years told me that she thinks she’s gay. We have kids, a life, a hoped-for future. Now she wants to consider an open relationship initially and that long term thinks her future will be with a woman.

Then a week later she quit the professional training she’s been doing. Her whole life she has only managed to get short-term low paid jobs. She was 2 1/2 years into a 3 year process to be qualified in a professional career path. She would have qualified in May and been able to start getting paid work in that specialism. We’re left with the debt of the studies without the financial opportunity of the qualification. 

And then yesterday she tried to kill herself. She researched online how to prepare a noose and bought the kit. She went for a walk to a secluded wooded area near us. She had everything in place but stopped just short of the jump. 

Then she went and stood by a fast moving road planned to step in front of one of the large trucks that thunder along it. But again, couldn’t do it. 

Then she came home, got in the bath and started cutting her wrists. Drew blood but stopped before it was fatal. 

I was unaware of all this until this morning when she showed me her wrist and then told me about the other two attempts. I had to unpack the belt and rope from her bag. Untie the noose and hide it somewhere. 

I’m devastated. Numb. Terrified. I love her deeply. We have teenage children. We have a good life. 

I’m upset and sad for her that she’s so ill. Mental illness has attacked her for years. She’s on meds and has a therapist. 

And I feel guilty for feeling so angry. I know that what she needs right now is kindness, compassion and support. And yet I also feel a boiling rage at the shit that has been dropped on me. I know she needs the opposite of anger right now. 

I don’t know what to do. 

I know you can’t fix it. I just wanted to be heard.",lipdhb,528,0.98,61,2021-02-13 00:51:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lipdhb/my_partner_tried_to_kill_herself_yesterday/,False,False,2021,2

I was yelling at him trying to explaining why college isn't for me. And the last thing he says to me is ""I'm very disappointed in you Danny."" Go fuck yourself dad.

The other day my mom invited her friend over. They were sitting in the kitchen drinking wine, nothing unusual. I'm on the stairs eavesdropping as I hear my mom's friend mentioning her daughter's plans for college. She's gotten scholarships, applied to many different schools, scored pretty well on the SAT, and wants to major in Nursing. And my mom's response? ""I wish my son could be like that.""

I want to fucking run away. I hate my fucking parents. I can't believe there are people out there with actual supportive parents. If you've got supportive parents and you love them, and you can talk to them about anything, you don't realize how insanely privileged you are. I'd give up an arm and leg to have your parents. Instead, I had to be born to a shitty Korean American family that doesn't give a flying fuck about anything except for school. I'd rather fucking die than live with my shitty family any longer.

backstory: throughout the ages of 7-10 my sister was physically and sexually violent towards me. she used to cut me in my pubic area, till i was bleeding for days. shed hit me almost every day and she would tell me i am useless (etc...). whenever i told my mom about the things she did, she never tried helping me. throughout the years, i asked her why she never stopped it, she called me a liar at times, but also said she doesnt recall any of it happening

due to being stuck at home (lockdown), these memories came back up, and i realized that it was child abuse. i am 16 years old now. i have been seeing a therapist eversince i was 12 because i once 'tried' to commit suicide.

today my mother asked me if i am getting my sister anything for her birthday, i said no, and my mother asked me why im not going to do that. i told her that i do not support an abuser, and then i brought up the cutting that she did. and i asked her once again why she never did anything about it. she stayed silent this time, but said she was going to ask my sister about it because she doesnt remember it.

I don't know how to be different. I don't want to hate myself, but I don't know how to be any other way. I would do anything to be happy for you. I am doing everything I can. I am working so hard.

14,Last night I dreamt that I was happy. I'd forgotten what it felt like.,"It's a curious thing, really. Waking up and realizing just what your life has become. Opening your eyes and looking around a room full of the stuff that used to excite you. After years and years of being just barely aware of the passage of time, coming to the stark realization that you have nothing left.

I suppose I should be thankful. I have lived a life overflowing with privilege, and have been just handed over opportunities that most people would have to fight for, and that many never get to have anyway. My parents love me deeply, that I know for a fact. Never in my life have I ever had to wonder where my next meal was gonna come from, or whether I would still have a home when the bills came. I've always had it all, and from this treasured oasis of opportunity I have built nothing but this small room filled with broken toys and half forgotten dreams.

I used to feel angry about the life I've wasted. When the anger ran out and I realized there was no one to blame but myself, I felt sad. Now the decades have slipped by without ever realizing it, what was supposed to be the best time of my life is now behind me, And now I feel nothing. Nothing but a hollow certainty that, just as I longed in my childhood to reach for the stars, now I just long for a quiet funeral, where the very few that cared will mourn and the many that knew my name will soon forget.

18,id kill myself for a hug,"im 15 years old, introvert, i have a christian family, and we live in my grandmother's house.

i have an abusive father, who i always feared ever since i was born because of how he reacts on things. it feels like he could kill me at any moment. just hearing him talk gives me goosebumbs. he beats me up for being lazy and stupid at chores while my mother just watch as these things happen.

i don't see him as a father figure to me because of what he is. he is lazier than me, he doesn't have a job and he always ask my mother for money. he wants me to work, he's such an asshole. he isn't alcohic but he is a drug addict. and going to rehab didn't really didn't change that much to him.

i never thought of being depressed, but growing up made me to. i am a lights operator in our church but they don't really care about knowing me. they just want my skills which makes me want to leave. going to church and having fellowship with my fellow teens makes all that sadness go away. but everytime the fellowship stops, being lonely and sad takes over me again. i only have a few friends to talk to in church and i don't think anyone wants to talk to me. not everyone even the pastor talks to me.

i have a few friends at school and a best friend but going to school is so boring.

my cousins in my mother's side, live in a different house and they are just always there for me. we watched tons of movie franchises, introduced me to a lot of games and whenever they come on vacation they want me to come with them. they know how abusive my father is and they want me to leave home and live with them. but the fact that they always yell at each other and they always fight is just so annoying and it drives me insane.

in the looks of it, this year 2020 got me trapped with my family for 1 whole year. i never thought it's going to be fun, there no church service and being trapped with an abusive father drives me insane and it's making my depression so much worse.. my family including my aunts and cousin always fight and they always yell.. i cant sleep very well. and fuck i cant even do my homework. i don't want to talk to my friends about what i feel just because i don't trust them.

there is alot of times in a middle of a lockdown where i was left at home with my father, and he kicks me out of the house for waking up late and being lazy and i dont know where to go in the middle of the pandemic. there was no one there to defend me, my mother was at work and i don't want to go to cousins house because they drive me insane.

well its not his house we why the fuck kick me out.
my mom knows how abusive he is and she also knows about him kicking me out. but she doesn't even bother to do anything. my mother is so kind to this idiot and that's where i thought she'd pick his husband rather than his children, and there is nothing i can do about that.

just how toxic and messed up this life is.

things are so messed up.

i never thought i would ever do this but i just wanna leave, leave my family behind. disappear forever. never comeback. no one knows i felt this way. not literally anyone. not even me. 

i kept asking my self why the fuck is everyone so fucking toxic!!! it just hurts me so much. so much pain id rather kill myself than leave.. because i am nothing without them. they are my family, but they also let me down. but i'll still do it, even if how hard it is. 

i must have a lot of money when that time comes 3 years from now.. i'll pack all of the things that i bought myself. meet with my best friend. maybe kiss her goodbye for a good friendship she gave me. and leave forever and never comeback. maybe find another love. maybe find a job.. maybe fulfill my dreams.. 

or just kill myself.

my thoughts: i hate how people say they want to end their life because of how miserable their life is but read this and think straight if you are going through this much pain as me. no one, not even my best friend and family knows about this. only you, me and the next person reading this. i hope i have someone to talk to about my feelings. i don't know what to do. i feel like i could end me any second now. im not afraid of dying because i'm already living in hell. 

this is very tough for me, the whole world has a problem right now and this is happening to me all at the same time.

it's too much.

no one is serious enough to talk to me and so if you reached this far,

i love you.😢❤️

It just reminds me of how fucking terrible this life is, that you need to be a fucking slave for money becuse money is everything and if you don't have, you're a subhuman or something like that. Like, it doesn't even matter if you are a good person, if you donate blood, if you are a volunteer or if have talents or abilities, all that people care about in this fucking doomed planet is about some imaginary numbers on a fucking screen. They decide if you are worth something if you have ""X"" number of this metal or paper or code. Like, you can't just trade something you have or something you can do for rice and eggs, no, you need to use this currency that some powerful people have the control over and if you don't like, ""FUCK YOU"", go die in the forest or some shit.

i'm tired of needing to think 24/7 about money/materialistic possessions because that is what society will judge if you are worth something or not. i just want to put a bullet in my brain.",n77bnn,2704,0.99,191,2021-05-07 19:52:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n77bnn/i_fucking_hatedespiseloathe_how_money_is/,False,False,2021,5
1,I wanted to commit suicide today but then I got Taco Bell instead,"Has anyone tried those chalupas lately? They’re amazing. I also am happy that they have vegetarian options because to me the black beans taste fine even though it isn’t meat. I do eat meat but I try not to when I can. 

This is a serious post though. The only way I can think of suicide successfully is by jumping off a cliff. Like everyone else here I am on medication and I have been to the mental hospital several times. 

I really am terrified of the pain to go through in order to pass away. I also believe in astrology and idk I’m kind of scared of being reincarnated into a life that is even worse than my current one. 

Either way.. I’m almost 29 so I’m going through my Saturn Return. I really don’t want to get older. And I don’t have 1 friend because I am mildly autistic so I ruin friendships with my bad social skills 

I don’t have a job right now I was working at Amazon but the 14 hour days after 8 months was killing me.

2,I am so scared of the future.,"I don't want to grow up.

I am afraid of making decisions on my own.

I am afraid of working a 9-5 job with a wage that won't get me anywhere.

I am afraid of finally reaching a point where everyday is an endless cycle of sleeping, waking up, working, sleeping.

If I can, I'd age backwards.

I want to go back to feeling like an actual kid again.

I hate having all these priorities .. I sincerely hate living for the future: theres always another task, another assignment, another opportunity that I must pursue for the sake of my future.

I don't even have time to live in the present moment anymore - everything is so fast-paced, so quick to change, it feels like I'm living for a nonexistent timeline.

I just want to stay where I am.

3,I'm fucked. Oh so fucked.,"Using a throwaway account because my friends have access to my main account and I really do not want to burden them with my issues - they have their own shit to go through.

The thoughts of suicide have been overwhelming me recently. I either drink, sleep or self-harm just to simply get through the day. Every day I cut a little deeper or sleep a little longer or drink a little more, I hope it kills me.

Every day I wake up and I wish that I hadn't, I'm a fucking parasite to everyone who knows me. I'm failing in school and can't land a job - hell, you'd be fucking lucky if you saw me outside of my room, let alone my fucking house.

I lost almost all my friends, and those who still talk to me only communicate through text and calls. I'm a mean person too and I don't blame those who left me.

I can't talk to anyone about this shit, my family thinks I'm a lazy asshole and honestly, they're right. All of my problems were caused by myself, I would've lived a fantastic life if I didn't screw it up.

But I did screw it up.

I don't know if I'll kill myself, the thoughts in my head beg me to but every time I go to do it I'm too much of a fucking coward.

16,Suicidal Thoughts after I gave myself permanent nerve damage in my penis.,"Around 7 months ago, I found websites and forums that promised penis size increase and attempted to do these techniques and failed horribly. I have lost so much sensitivity for no reason. Everywhere on my penis has arounf 10% sensitivity left and my scrotum's sensitivity is almost all gone aswell. Morning wood is super soft, erections are super soft. I'm only 19 and damaged my penis for life. I'm heading to the doctors next friday, but read all on the internet that nerve damage is permanent. In the last 7 months there have been zero improvement in my penis. I can't sleep anymore and can't tell anyone in my life because this is so embarrassing. I've dropped all my college classes except one and failed that class. This has taken a mental toll in my life and I don't think I can continue any longer. The first time I went to the doctors, they just gave me cialis, if they do it again I think I'm done with life. I can't continue life like this, every time I pee, take a shower, wake up with a weak erection, every time I walk I get reminded with the lack of sensations from my groin, I get reminded that I fucked everything up due to my insecurities. I have shut myself off from the world in the last 7 months. I just stay in bed all day or watch this livestreamer xqc which helps me forget until he ends stream.  I went dead silent in my friend's groupchat ever since this happened, I can't just pop in like I have havent been gone for little over half a year.

I know some will say ""you're an idiot for doing this"" and you are correct. I wasn't even small, I'm 6 in long with 4.3 in girth . But how can I feel good about my size when I was hit all my life with that I have a small penis stereotype because I am an asian american. The first time I was hit with that stereotype was in 5th grade I remember that girl that said I didn't have a penis because i was asian. That terrified 9 or 10 year old me. Yeah and of course i get hit that stereotype in middle school as well with more stuff like I eat dog and what not. Flash forward to highschool, I'm in the football locker room with my teammates, went to take a piss at the urinals, my douche of a teammate stares at my dick while pissing says I have a pencil dick and tells my other teammates and make more racist jokes. Now flash forward to college during the corona virus shit. Asians getting blamed and shit, I was filling up my gas and this dude yells at me ""these small dicked asians ruin everything"". I can't say shit except ""shut the fuck up bitch"". Later stumbled upon penis enlargement exercises and gave myself nerve damage. Your penis is fine they way it is, if it gets hard thats all you need. You shouldn't be turned down by a life partner over your penis size. I've dated 3 girls and none of them complained. I should have felt satisfied from that. If a girl denies you for your size, you dodged a massive bullet, a missile maybe.

If you are self concious about your size, please do not do what I did it's not worth it at all.",nnsbv7,615,0.98,106,2021-05-29 17:35:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nnsbv7/suicidal_thoughts_after_i_gave_myself_permanent/,False,False,2021,5

But even by paying for it, I couldn't have an intercourse. 

I fucking hate my body. I hate being a man. I hate all of this. I'm a living failure as a male.

2,"My mom is dying, and i'm killing myself when it happens","I never thought i'd make an account here but i think i need this.
I'm 24 my mom is 47, the cancer is winning, it's over. 

Her doctor said she has 2 months to live.
I never thought that this day would ever come, i have so many regrets in life, the things i could've done but never ended up doing... it's all coming back to me now.. all the good times i had with my mom when i was younger, the times we went to the beach,the playground..every single bad thing i ever said to her is just excruciatingly painful now, ranging from even the smallest of things, how i always laughed at her baking skills, all the times i ignored her or yelled back at her.. i just wanna hug her and never let go.
If i could go back in time i would change everything, i would hug her, tell her how much i love her every single night and spend so much more time with her. I took everything for granted, and now i can't do anything to change that.

She means everything to me, she's the only person that's always been there for me, the only person that always belived in me.
Nothing could have prepared me for this moment, that constant gut wrenching feeling i have knowing full well it's gonna happen soon, and there is nothing i can do about it.

My sleeping schedule is all messed up, every night begins with me crying then calming down and then crying again, i wish i could just take her place.

I'm doing everything i can to make her as happy as possible, i wanna talk to her for hours but she can't, i don't even care about what we talk about i just wanna cherish every single second i have left with her.

Being there with her feels like a blessing and a curse, the pain never goes away.. but she's still here with me she's still alive, hearing her voice and telling her how much i love her feels so special ...but i feel like i'm not doing enough.. something is always missing.
I can't imagine my life without her.

Got a nice scar on my right thigh. My mental health has been suffering bad this year dealing with an injury for 6 months from broken bones in ankle and a completely shredded ligament.  I get surgery on it in a couple weeks. I went to bed last night telling myself if I woke up sad I'd finish what I started 4 yrs ago. But I'm still here. My cat is curled up next to my injured ankle and I'm trying to be strong. Trauma memories get the best of me this time of year from a lifetime of abuse but I'm thankful for the positive people I do have in my life. I'm thankful for my cat. I'm still here. For today. I'm here.

Golden hour and boyhood dreams, waiting for that ‘lucky’ person. I mourn the moments of sibling rivalry and parently hugs, I mourn our happiness. I mourn our innocence.

I’m sorry that you are lonely, you’ve pushed them away. You regret it, don't you? You seek love in the bite of a blade, and the kiss of a lit flame.

12,I wish I had killed myself when I was a teenager,"I have never actually been actively suicidal, but the thought has been there ever since my early teens when something pretty traumatic happened to me. It was sort of a back door, you know? But never something I considered going through with in a near future. I didn't have a plan or anything really, but the thought of having a way out was comfort enough. Really, the simple thought that ""this won't last forever, it will all end some day"" was usually enough to keep me from feeling panicked and claustrophobic for simply being alive.

And growing up I naïvely thought that life would just automatically get better without me actually putting in the time and effort to make it so. The prospect of becoming an unemployed, depressed and washed up adult didn't even occur to me. I was convinced that by this time I would either be dead or having gotten my shit together, have a decent job and maybe even a steady relationship. This in-between sad existence was something I didn't expect. 13 year old me would be so disappointed.

Now I'm at a stage in life where I'm still young, but I've managed to ruin basically everything I had going for me in life. If I had put in the effort I could have gone places. But here I am, borderline-alcoholic, depressed, used up and hating myself. Through my careless, self destructive lifestyle I've gotten myself a bad reputation, allowed people to take advantage of me and used and abused other people and more or less hurt myself in every way possible, physically and mentally. I'm scarred and damaged inside and out. I'm a shell. I've gone out of my way to make sure I get to see the very worst of human kind by spending my time with others who hate themselves and life as much as I do. I've destroyed so much I don't even know if I have more to lose. I feel like a bottomless hole of hatred, rage and contempt for myself and everyone else. I can't feel happiness, I can't love. I can't feel anything but shame, regret and anger. I resent myself for allowing life to get this bad.

15,I’m going to end my life in December.,"I know exactly the day I’m going to do it. There are several reasons why I’ve chosen this date. First, my best friend of 12 years is getting married and I will be his best man in November. Second, I want to see my family for Christmas one last time. I’m going to drive myself somewhere relatively far and shoot myself in the head while in my car. I carry the suicide note I’ve already written in my wallet. I break down and cry every day. I think about dying almost every minute of the day. I do not sleep well, I won’t eat for days at a time. I’ve lost all motivation and hope for the future. I’m 24 years old and I have no desire to continue to live. I am only afraid that I will end my life before this date. I’ve spoken with suicide hotline several times this month. Only to keep myself alive until the end of December. I think about my plan everyday and it’s the only kind of mental relief I feel. I hope to die leaving my loved ones with good memories of me. It’s hard to fake being okay. I’m only staying alive for them. Unfortunately they are not enough to keep me going. I am certain I will end my life.


Edit: First off i’d like to say thank you to everyone that has reached out to me privately and in the comments. I did not expect any of that. Also, I’ll share my story for those that have asked. 

When I was a child I was abused mentally and physically by my parents and grandmother. Despite the abuse I loved my parents and looked up to them, they divorced when i was 7 and I was completely devastated by the fact that my father was never going to come back home. The abuse did not stop however until I was in my early teens. In high school I was extremely depressed, had few friends and never a significant other. Never any aspirations for the future. When I graduated I went to live with my dad, that experience ended when we had physical altercation which resulted in him having a broken finger. He and I do not have a good relationship to this day. In the 7 years since, I have tired but have failed many times to get through college. Ive had many failed relationships that ended because I was always lied to and cheated on. Ive been addicted to various drugs over the years and I feel that my brain has turned to mush. Though now I only smoke weed and drink often. Recently I’ve gone through a break up that I feel has tipped me over the edge. We used to live together and we were happy for a while. For the first time in my life I felt that I had a purpose. I thought I could build a future with her, which is something I was never able to visualize with anyone else. For the first time in my life, I saw a future that wasn’t grim and full of failure. Unfortunately I could not meet her expectations and she ended the relationship. We’ve been sleeping together almost weekly and each time I feel that there’s a chance i can fix things. But she shoots me down each time. About a week ago she told me she’s taking a job that will require her to travel for 13 weeks at a time. She will be leaving in late August. Before I even got this news I was already planning on ending my life. I had my suicide note ready. I’ve been packing things away and trashing other things. So that my loved ones won’t have to. But now I’m afraid that when she leaves I will not have the strength to push through until December.",ot4tq6,586,0.99,122,2021-07-28 07:08:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ot4tq6/im_going_to_end_my_life_in_december/,False,False,2021,7

I took a beating last Thursday that left me bloody and another Friday early morning that fucked me up pretty good. I decided next time I’d just let him finish me off. 

Catch you on the other side. Remember me when you see the news article, it’s just a matter of time.

1,I find it kinda funny that “normal” people see suicide as unimaginable or something that you’d “never do”.,"It hits me every once in a while that normal people don’t think about suicide as often as I do. I’m not even actively suicidal right now, but I consider it often enough for me to realize that I’m one of the outliers in society. So, over the years suicide has become more and more realistic, and has almost become a part of my daily life.

What gets me though is how that’s *totally* not the case for everyone else. If you mention suicide, people either freak out or just play it off as a joke as if the concept of “suicide” only exists in movies and books. And while it is sad, I actually find that kind of funny.

For example, I hate working. I fucking hate getting up early to sit at a desk doing shit I don’t want to do for 8 hours straight. But if I tell anyone about that feeling, guess how the conversation will go?

Me: man, I really don’t want a job. I wish I could just sit around doing nothing all day.

Them: well you need money, don’t you?

Me: yeah but I don’t want to get a job.

Them: tough, that’s the way the world works, you lazy fuck. You’ve gotta work if you wanna live.

Me: well technically I don’t *have* to, because i could just kill myself and not have to deal with it.

Them: seriously? You’d rather commit suicide than get a job? That’s pathetic.

Me: yep, I’m pathetic. Thanks for reminding me, that’s another reason why I should just kill myself.

Them: wait, you’re serious? Nooooo don’t kill yourself you’re loved and you have so much to live for!!!!

I just find it funny that people don’t consider how all of this bullshit could just stop immediately If I put a gun in my mouth. They’re like “if you don’t want to live by the world’s rules, you don’t get to live at all >:(“

But when I decide “yeah that sounds fair enough, guess I’ll just off myself then :)” their tune changes and they can’t fathom that anyone would choose to not live in this vicious cycle of suffering and guilt.

Of course I can’t say any of this shit in real life, because I don’t think this attitude helps in the slightest. It’s nice to think and rant about online, but if I started telling people how I really feel I’d get thrown back into the psych ward. Or worse, people I care about would get tired of my moping around and they’d cut me off, and then I’d *have* to go through with it.

Everything’s fucked, and the only *”real”* solution I can come up with is just opting out of life. And if I bring it up before actually going through with it, I can only expect to be mocked or bombarded with insincere attempts at “helping”.

13,Thinking about this kid,"I guess he’s not a kid but when you’re 46 years old you still picture 25 year olds as kids.

Got the page at like 4am this morning.  Trauma activation.  25 year old male.  Gun shot wound to head.

Couple minutes later it updates to CPR in progress.  

Maybe 30 minutes later we pronounced him dead.  But his body is still trying to breath after we shut off the vent.  Could palpate a carotid pulse.  So I hooked the BVM up to his ET tube while the resident called the trauma attending back.  We tried again but called time of death (again) like 10-20 minutes later.

He was a beautiful young man.  I mean, other than the gun shot wound to his temple.  But it just made me think.  About that moment.  When the idea becomes reality.  What is it that makes someone think that this is my only way out?

I’ve been thinking more about it, lately.  In general, before this morning.  What would I do.  What would others think or say.  

I feel trapped.  I can’t possibly express this to anyone.  How could you?  How could anyone possibly understand?

So here I lay in bed.  Thinking about this young man.  And having to return tonight for another shift.

I really wish I could sleep.  I’m tired but sleep will not come.

Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL. 

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. 

Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

**tl;dr** Any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's about any cause or issue (rather than a request for personal support) is not allowed here.  Please report everything of the nature that you see.",pl9suy,712,0.99,43,2021-09-10 00:01:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pl9suy/please_remember_that_no_activism_of_any_kind_is/,False,False,2021,9

All for what? So we have money to put a roof over our heads, food on the table, and maybe a couple of beers on the weekend.

That's bullshit. How fucking boring is that, that's not the life I want. Yet that's probably the life most of us will have. What a waste of time, money and energy, it's all so pointless. No one's gonna remember us a 100 years from now, it'll be like we never existed.

12,I think porn is destroying my life.,"I know the whole “post nut clarity” thing is common, but after I’m done I feel truly terrible.

My self esteem and confidence have been ruined and every time I look at porn I feel worse every time. My “size” probably doesn’t help my confidence either. That’s probably why the porn I look at has been getting more and more depraved and confidence busting. I feel like have no value as a man. As a person. I’m sure porn isn’t the sole reason I want to die, but I feel like it’s contributed more and more to my issues these past few years. I don’t really know how much longer I can hold on. Chasing these pipe dreams of some semblance of a happy life with a person I love. I don’t look to the future and I’m blind to the present. I only ever look to the past when I was actually happy and innocent. 

Innocence. 

I miss being innocent. I miss not caring (or knowing) about sex, attraction, and whatnot. I just want to be the happy little kid who had a very active imagination, pretending to be a power ranger while running around the house. 

I don’t exactly remember the day I lost my innocence, but I feel like it was too soon. I feel like I was too young to be introduced to porn.

14,I choose death,"I give myself a year to tie up loose ends. I’ve been battling treatment-resistant depression & C-PTSD from multiple trauma & abuse for 20 years. I tried my best. 

I completed 6+ years individual therapy (ongoing), group therapy, hypnotherapy, intensive outpatient program, partial hospitalization, rehabilitation, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, internal family systems, holistic treatment, multiple medications, ketamine therapy, the public psych ward, meditation, exercise, diet, journaling and recently 36 rounds of deep TMS, I got multiple painful laser treatments on my self-harm scars.

What more do people expect me to do? I tried choosing life for a long time. I have no regrets. Why keep trying to live longer? My death is inevitable either way. 

By finally choosing death, I can live out the rest of my days peacefully, no longer battling for my life every waking second.

UPDATE EDIT (a long letter, but also a response to everyone who has unexpectedly reached out):

Someone deleted a comment saying I’d be committing “murder” and it’s an “immoral act.” If you die by suicide, you are not doing anything immoral. You are not a murderer. You died from an illness. Depression is called the “silent killer” for a reason. Many, many- too many- people worldwide die from suicide daily. I am not supporting anyone else to die by suicide, merely expressing my own personal thoughts- and perhaps people who can unfortunately relate to me, can find solace & feel less alone realizing I am fighting this battle with them, hearing their own similar feelings reflected in the void.

We must do tremendously better to help those ailing from mental illness, a sickness primarily devastating the most important organ of the human body, the brain.

No matter what, I will advocate for the de-stigmatization of mental health. Telling someone suicidal that they are justifying an “immoral murder” casts further shame, alienation and gross misunderstanding + oversimplification upon a serious illness. 

Educate yourself and please avoid using someone’s personal pain & suffering to have a debate on your projected willfully ignorant “morality.” I’ve been condemned to “go straight to hell” when I was a child, by my own father, for feeling suicidal. I’ve heard it all. For fellow people battling mental health issues, you are strong. I know from personal experience, society attacks those with mental illness. It’s like kicking a dog that’s already down x1000, and it’s pathetic how others can condescend, judge and mistreat those with mental health issues. I know we already feel worse than anyone could ever imagine. 

I appreciate anyone who greets this post with empathy & thoughtfulness. 

But if you want to preach at me, ask yourself: why are you the kind of person who wants to criticize and condemn someone in extreme pain? Are you a sadist? Ask yourself about your own unhealed issues and why a stranger’s suicidal feelings gives you the urge to name them a “murderer” and “immoral,” etc, ask yourself why you attempt passing personal judgment on their soul? 

Although I battle suicidal ideation 24/7, I hold no hatred in my heart for others, no self-righteousness, and understand everyone is fighting their own personal battle, and I am not so egocentric as to think I can condemn & judge those suffering in their mental health. 

My greatest strength is empathy; I hear and see everyone who is offering help in some way. You are good souls. I am so empathetic I believe the person calling me a “murderer” was trying to help in their own twisted way, they just aren’t educated on mental health issues. I thank everyone who has responded with good intentions. You do make a difference- if you hold such empathy for a mere stranger on reddit, I am sure your loved ones are blessed by your presence in their lives. If my post upsets you in any way, I suggest avoiding this subreddit if you feel fragile. Please protect yourself- you deserve healthy boundaries, including on the internet.",qnaw2k,449,0.99,39,2021-11-05 13:15:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qnaw2k/i_choose_death/,False,False,2021,11
0,Can't die yet. Gotta wait for my Amazon package.,"I've spent the last month or so thinking about being dead. But of course I couldn't just up and die. Christmas was around the corner, and I had so much shit to wrap, so many appetizers and cookies to make. Plus dying before Christmas is kinda rude. Death doesn't make for good dinner conversation. So I didn't die.

And now it's after Christmas, but I still can't die. I have an Amazon order for my stepdad's retirement dinner. It's just a $8 coffee mug, but I have to wait for it to arrive so I can fill it with jelly beans and give it to him this weekend.

Then the weekend after that is my brother's 21 birthday. Sure as fuck can't die before that. What a shitty way to spend your 21st birthday. And the weekend AFTER THAT my other brother and sister (the twins) are turning 18. I planned on making my sister some cute jewelry, so I still really don't have time to die if I actually intend on getting that made.

And then it'll be my birthday. The big 3-0.
Thirty years of being, well, me.
Thirty years of waking up each morning, stumbling through the menial tasks of living, the mundane gruntwork of keeping body and soul together, of maintaining healthy relationships, of planning for the future, of eating, breathing, shitting, and going to sleep each night.
Thirty years of fuck-all. 

But I can't die today. I have to pick up orange juice and bread from the store after work. There's still laundry to do. The dishes are still soaking in the sink. And my Amazon package hasn't arrived yet.


EDIT: Y'all have been wildly supportive, and I just want to say that I'm grateful for all of the people in this sub who are willing and able to be vulnerable about their mental states. It often feels like drowning in deep water, and I'm glad that everyone here today is still fighting the undertow. Keep treading. Grab onto any lifeline you can find.

1,Widowed by suicide on Christmas,"UPDATE 2

Today is harder than, not easier. This pain is unbearable. There is one family who are friends with my family, but also my husband’s family. They didn’t comfort me at all on Christmas Day, but today I heard from two of them. They said my husband is so proud of me. He told them. He was proud of me for leaving him to become my own person. He told me, but to swallow his price and tell others means so much to me. 

Update 1

I just got his name tattooed on my ring finger. We always talked about doing it, but never did. 

TRIGGER 

I so badly want to die. I found my husband dead Christmas Day. He shot himself in the head. They dragged me off his body. I called his mom to let her know and his family came and accused me of killing him to my face. 

I didn’t shoot him, but he did it bc of me. I spent all day Christmas with his blood still on me. I don’t know what is worse, being dragged off of him or being accused of killing this man I loved so deeply. 

This pain and loneliness is breaking my heart and I wish I could just do the same, but we have children. I can’t leave them without a parent.",rrwu9i,1005,0.98,203,2021-12-30 08:35:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/rrwu9i/widowed_by_suicide_on_christmas/,False,False,2021,12

His sister said that he was ""too sensitive for this harsh world"" – and you know what, so am I.

Or Jack London.

Osamu Dazai – “I want to die more than ever before. There's no chance now of a recovery. No matter what sort of thing I do, no matter what I do, it's sure to be a failure, just a final coating applied to my shame.”

Ryunosuke Akutagawa – ""I am living now in the unhappiest happiness imaginable. Yet, strangely, I have no regrets. I just feel sorry for anyone unfortunate enough to have had a bad husband, a bad son, or a bad father like me. So goodbye, then ...""

Luigi Tenco.

Dalida – ""Life is unbearable for me. Forgive me.""

Kurt Cobain.

Anna Kavan – “I haven't felt anything for 20 years.”

Alejandra Pizarnik.

Vsevolod Garshin.

Steve Cash.

Mark Linkous.

George Sanders – “Dear World, I am leaving because I am bored. I feel I have lived long enough. I am leaving you with your worries in this sweet cesspool. Good luck.”

And countless more.

5,"My final suicide note, goodbye","  

I don’t think I can do this anymore. Everywhere I go, it all feels so grey. I’d often try to make myself upset, because at least it was a feeling in and of itself.  Objectively speaking, my life's been great. I’ve had a plethora of friends and romantic partners, I’ve had nothing short of an amazing, loving, and dedicated family. So why do I feel so empty inside? Why is it that I can clearly remember the last time I felt true happiness? A random fleeting moment outside of a gym in 2017, it was but a fleeting moment, but I felt as if a warm cascade blanketed my soul, I felt a feeling of positive emotion radiate through me. It may have only lasted seconds, but it was sobering. It showed me what I lacked, no matter how hard I tried, that feeling never came back. It would be appropriate to say I’ve thought about suicide for quite a long time. The cold sinking feeling that stands your hair on end, the feeling of being sucked into a bottomless void of negative emotion. It felt comforting, because I felt something.  My life isn’t a prototypical tragedy, its just devoid of a fundamental element of what a life should consist of. I’d probably be more satisfied if I had a better reason to do this, sometimes I long for a tragic life as a justification for my suffering. 

I truly am defective.

To my friends and family: It should go without saying that this isn’t your fault. You could have never known. No, you shouldn’t of reached out, I didn’t want the help. Please, don’t blame yourselves. I have no interest in psychiatric treatment, I’ve read a multitude of papers on the efficacy or lack thereof when it comes to pharmacological treatments along with their intolerability. Despite being unable to register the feeling, objectively I know I was loved, and for that, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm sorry I couldn’t stick around any longer, I just can’t imagine decades more of this. 

I hereby leave all of my belongings and finances to the whim of my Mother, Father, and Sibling.

5,The emergency room treats people with mental health issues like shit.,"I was admitted last night to the ER for a suicide attempt. I was very upset and had multiple panick attacks.

I know I needed help. Yet the doctor send me away. In the next hour I was rushed in by ambulance for a more serious attempt. Which could have been avoided if the doctor actually would have listend to me. 

The attempt caused me to have surgery. Note, I’m extremely anxious about anesthesia etc. So I tried to walk away, the nurses forced me back in bed. After a couple of minutes i tried to walk away again, this time they put me into seclusion. I told them i didn’t want to take off my pants because of a recent rape, they proceeded to push me to the ground and forced them of me. This made me have a severe panick attack. I was left alone.

After a while I got out of seclusion, still visibly upset. They wanted to put the saturation thiny on my finger but I didn’t give it straight away because i was wiping my tears. I got dragged to seclusion because of this. 

This morning I got the surgery, i tried to comply as much as possible. The surgery went well and i got into a recovery room. The doctor came and told me I was free to go. I told him I will try to kill myself again. He said that thats a risk he’s willing to take. 

Right now I’m sitting on my bathroom floor in tears not knowing what I should do next.

Oh and btw, they called my parents. Eventhough I told them i don’t want that. I am 18, so they can’t share information without my consent

This is just a fraction of what happend. Don’t wamt to share all the details because i don’t want to trigger anyone.",t884uw,554,0.99,92,2022-03-06 20:53:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/t884uw/the_emergency_room_treats_people_with_mental/,False,False,2022,3
6,I fucked up and told somebody,"I swore to myself to never tell anybody of my plans and keep up a normal facade until the very end. I thoughtlessly let it slip to SOMEONE IN GRIEF WHOSE FRIEND HAD OFFED HIMSELF that I did not have long to live. They picked up on it immediately unfortunately. I am such a nuisance on everybody. This person is such a heartful guy and had a talk with me, apparently trying to change my plan. FUCK I hate myself. I just want to make my preparations and quietly end this shit existence.",td995c,501,0.98,38,2022-03-13 15:28:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/td995c/i_fucked_up_and_told_somebody/,False,False,2022,3
7,Two people had sex in the 90s and somehow that's my fucking problem,"God damn it mom and dad, I know you didn't plan things to go this way but there's not really anyone else at fault for my existence. You really couldn't have just adopted a dog or something? You already had kids just put a mirror next to one and now you've got twins instead of making me exist and wish you hadn't",tvqlv6,494,0.99,46,2022-04-04 02:14:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tvqlv6/two_people_had_sex_in_the_90s_and_somehow_thats/,False,False,2022,4
8,So this is my final goodbye,"Ive been on this subreddit for about 5 years and this is my last throwaway account and my last message. I may be talking to the void here but I want to personally thank everyone on this subreddit for being so kind, for talking me out of my attempts, for making me feel like i was a person.

unfortunately though this is the end for me, it’s too late to go back now but i want everyone to know that i am grateful for everything they’ve done, thank you for helping people like me, thank you for being this caring because most of us have never felt cared for our entire lives. 

thank you and goodbye, i can peacefully go knowing there is someone who at least tried for someone like me",teo64j,486,0.99,75,2022-03-15 12:44:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/teo64j/so_this_is_my_final_goodbye/,False,False,2022,3
9,I hate when someone tells you to “just get help”,How many of us have tried to get help? Sometimes it just doesn’t fucking work. It’s even worse when you don’t have a support system and have to deal with everything on your own. I don’t even know what the point of typing all this out is.. I’m just tired of making an effort to get nothing in return.,tplhim,484,0.99,70,2022-03-27 14:50:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tplhim/i_hate_when_someone_tells_you_to_just_get_help/,False,False,2022,3
