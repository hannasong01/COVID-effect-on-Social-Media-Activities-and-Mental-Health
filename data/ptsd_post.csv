5,"People have such burning hatred for poor people, and it's extremely..... upsetting","I suffer from PTSD from mutiple different things in my life, but one of the most intense and horrifying to remember is when I was homeless for a year. 

In America at least (though Im sure in other places as well), once you become homeless or in poverty, you're no longer a part of ""society"". You're not a ""member of society"", you're a Burden. A 'leech', for needing anything, anything at all, even something as small as a listening ear or breadcrumb. It's an offense to even suggest you may need help, to suggest that anyone should even consider helping you. Because in their eyes, you must have done something to ""deserve"" poverty, or homeless. It's like a moral branding to them. It doesn't matter how you became severely poor/homeless, and it doesnt matter how desperately you're fighting to survive/escape your circumstances. ""Poor/homeless"" is all they need to know to ""know"" that you're unworthy of help, or of compassion. You're the scum beneath their feet. You're not even human.

Even after being homeless and tormented for a year, and then in poverty for 4, I still feel myself become crushed under the weight of people's disgust for poor/homeless people. It utterly shocks me. It steals the breath from my lungs. 

The internet is full of cruelty and anger, obviously, but..... it's not just on the internet, anyways, not by a longshot. People are not shy about their disgust for poor people, and if you haven't been in extreme poverty you may not have even noticed how bad it is. You may have some deeply rooted hatred and judgement inside you, too. 

It's. horrifying. And it brings me back to the most horrifying days/experiences of my life. I think i had a conclusion to this, but i feel like a child again, starving and absolitely terrified and being proven to that even the mostly seemly compassionate or kind people will turn on you the moment you have no money. The moment you become """"worthless"""". 

Here's a conclusion i guess,,, Anyone else traumatized by poverty/homelessness, or more specifically, how people treated you because you were in poverty/homeless",f6zhl4,252,0.98,59,2020-02-20 20:49:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/f6zhl4/people_have_such_burning_hatred_for_poor_people/,False,False,2020,2

I used to be someone who was in tune and quite sharp and had amazing memory and was a good thinker. 

I have noticed since I witnessed many traumatic events that I am not myself and seem to act ""stupid"" and ditzy.  I do Biosciences in a Level 5 HND and I can do it but I just can't seem to grasp the information like I used to and people think I am stupid (and have told me to my face).

12,The way men look at women,"I want to start by saying I am not gloating here. I am an average looking woman. I‚Äôm also not here to play the victim. Nor am I saying all men do this. 

I hate how some men look at women sometimes. For example, when I‚Äôm walking around the store, I‚Äôll see a man (sometimes even with his significant other) check out me or other women. And it disturbs me. It‚Äôs so obvious their thoughts are sexual. Every time a man looks at me with those sexual eyes, I get triggered. I end up having an episode soon after. I hate it. Why can‚Äôt men control the way they look at women?

13,Never Ask A Survivor Why They Didn't Leave Sooner,"If you‚Äôre a survivor, chances are you have been victim blamed/shamed. In the past when it came to sexual assault, it was often the woman that was blamed for ‚Äúasking for it.‚Äù I recall reading a book called ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Buy My Love‚Äù that talked about the influence of advertisements. There was a specific rape case where the judge ruled that the woman asked for it simply because the brand of her underwear was Victoria‚Äôs Secret. Now, we are finally holding men accountable for sexual assault, but why not for abuse? There is a stereotype that low income or minority females are too ‚Äúuneducated‚Äù to not leave. This is false. Abuse can happen to ANYONE of any social class or ethnicity. Abuse is rarely shown right away. I‚Äôm sure if we saw it in the first week we would have run but that simply isn‚Äôt how it works, especially in narcissistic abuse. There is a ‚Äúlove bombing‚Äù or ‚Äúgolden period‚Äù that can last up to a year or more where the narc acts perfectly, the change in their behavior starts slowly and is a brainwash process that has us hold onto the love bomb period in the hopes of them being capable of being that way again. Once brainwash is complete, abuse is the new normal and the voice in your head telling you something wrong is still there but yet you feel trapped to leave. I‚Äôve learned a lot about this type of abuse from this account \*\*@he\_never\_hit\_me\_but\*\* dedicated narcissistic abuse survivors. The handle alone makes me feel validated since I was never hit. Never let anyone judge you for not leaving right away. Leaving is a process and often involves extensive planning to be able to do it safely. No one understands your reality unless they‚Äôve been through it themselves.

17,Who else had to unlearn normalizing and being flattered by men creepily leering and sexualizing you?,"Who else had to unlearn normalizing and being flattered by men creepily leering and sexualizing you?

I thought the way men showed they liked me was when they leered and sexualized me. I was groomed due to child sexual abuse and our sexist society... I thought this behavior was normal. I was flattered, turned on (traumatic bonding and brain changes), and was attracted to creeps. It didn‚Äôt feel like love or like a guy liked me enough if they didn‚Äôt sexualize me.

Now as I have been processing my past trauma, I realize how much I hate and fear being sexualized. I don‚Äôt want to be sexualized at all and get grossed out when men do. I don‚Äôt want to do anything sexual or even date for that matter. I now see how wrong it is for men to minimize me to a sexual body!

I was so offended recently when I went to an educational discussion and at the end of the meeting the men were leering at my body.. how horrible that sex was the only thing that was on their mind instead of my intellect and what I could bring to help them!!!

So this is progress for me to realize how wrong sexism is because in the past, I never saw myself as a feminist. I still struggle with my body being turned on by creepiness because it was what was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for so long. I am actually afraid of my sexuality right now and feel shame and disgust about it especially when I become turned on by violating sex. 

However, I‚Äôm also noticing When I watch movies or see pictures of women getting sexualized, I get grossed out and triggered More than I ever have. I am now allowing myself to get grossed out by the creepers and being mean to them when I wasn‚Äôt able to for most of my life. I still have a part of me that gets turned on by creepiness and sexualization but I can confidently say it is starting to fade away especially as I continue processing my trauma and become more of a feminist. I was brainwashed by society and the abusers in my life. It is so bizarre to now see the truth and how what I was told was a lie about the sexualization and abuse of women to be normal and flattering.

 I know with time and therapy, I will be able to retrain my brain to be turned on by healthy sex with consent and boundaries completely. I am already noticing that I am being drawn to these types of healthy relationships which I am very proud of myself for.

You have to remember, PTSD is a serious illness, and it can be just as dangerous and deadly as any virus. We're going to be dealing with these issues for a lot longer than coronavirus is going to be a daily headline. 
You need to ask yourself, if you're in a difficult or dangerous situation if it is really worth it, and if it would be worth the long-term damage to your mental health?

They introduced me to my all-time favorite band Glass Animals. I fucking adore them, but for almost a year after the abuse I couldn't listen to them. And it hurt more than other triggers because they mutilated something I love. And that is really shitty of them.

Within a very short time of me being awake, he put his mouth on me in a silly, affectionate way (I think he maybe pretended to bite my arm or something similar) and I cringed away from him SO HARD. It was like I could feel the ""other person's"" mouth on me and I just couldn't handle it. Then I felt like such a dick because my reaction hurt my partner's feelings since there was zero context and I wasn't in a space to be able to verbalize anything in that moment other than ""I don't like that right now.""

Twice last week guys I know & get along with threw things at me to get my attention instead of walking over, using the chat on our computers, or just rolling their chair over 4ft & tapping on my shoulder or desk. Both rank higher than I, but I don't report to either. This triggered me, especially the second time when I was struck in the back of the head. It didn't hurt, but both times it set off my symptoms & I had to hide it & carry on with what they wanted to discuss. 

I haven't reported my PTSD to HR under the ADA, because so far I haven't needed accommodations. But I almost flipped out into defensive ""fight"" mode both times this happened & would have definitely gotten in trouble for it if I had.

Thoughts on my sign idea?

Edit update: thank you so much everyone! I put a note saying ""Please don't throw stuff at me, I startle easily. Thanks!"" on my dry-erase board & the guys that were throwing stuff came over & proactively apologized. Now they just come tap on my desk in my field of view.

3,"Abuse victims with PTSD, have you guys also noticed how abuse is used for comedy in media?","It's kinda painful to see what causes me so much heartache used in comic relief. I've mostly seen this with emotional and physical abuse. For example, i remember seeing good luck Charlie as a kid and seeing how neglected Gabe was. He was the 3rd out of 5 siblings, but the parents treat the other 4 kids with more love and attention than him. Causing him to act out and be a delinquent. (And Disney loves to copy this dynamic into other shows)
A more recent example I've seen is in my favorite game Persona 5 the Royal, the character Ryuji had already been physically abused by his dad and coach, then his friends casually called him ""stupid"" and beat up on him. There's even a controversial scene in the original Persona 5 where Ryuji is implied to get assaulted by two stereotypical gay men. And this isn't the first example of a character abused for comedy in the history of Atlus games.
As a domestic violence victim who's abuse was treated as comedy or punishment in real life, it brings me back to a time where my pain was used as a punchline. My abuser and his friend thought it was funny when I got upset in response to abuse.

Once I sent her the link, she texted me immediately swearing at me saying F words. 
She must really hate Jesus. 

I hear her go to her mom, I think she is complaining about my message I sent her. Next, her mom comes to my room to talk to me. Then my daughter comes to my room swearing at me . Calling me fucking idiot . Fuck u . Etc. 

Next thing I know she became fully possessed by devil. collapsed to the floor , yelling at the top of her lungs, crying, swearing, kicking walls.

Satan is alive in her. 

Her face looks red , red bruises around her eyes and forehead. 
Further proof, 
Satan possessed her.

My religious, idiot father sent me a text message of Jesus dying on the cross . A very graphic one with the look of torture on his face and blood dripping all over his head and body. 

I immediately text him..
‚ÄúWhat the fuck ! Why are you sending me graphic images for !!! I‚Äôm blocking you! I‚Äôm not even Christian for fucks sake! ‚Äú 

As I‚Äôm in the process of blocking him, he sends me that picture AGAIN.

I show my mom, she goes to his room to talk to him.

I walk pass by raising my voice ..‚Äù stop sending me that shit! Do you think I want to see blood like that ?! Do you think I want to see blood like ?!!!!! U fucking idiot ! U think I don‚Äôt remember ?!! I remember every-fucking-day !!! Fuck u !!! ‚Äú

( btw , I never swear especially at my parents ^ but I was really upset ^ )

Next thing,  I‚Äôm collapsed on the floor having a full blown panic attack . It lasts almost 30 mins. I couldn‚Äôt get up, so I crawled to my room to look for a bottle of Ativan. Took 1 to calm down.

After, I looked in the mirror, the blood vessels burst around the skin of my eyes, temples &amp;amp; on my forehead.

Note : if my father wasn‚Äôt an inconsiderate, self-righteous, bigoted idiot, maybe he‚Äôd remember that I lost my cousin (whom I was closest to) along with her unborn son, 4 years ago from an extremely, graphic homicide committed by her husband. 

It‚Äôs been 2 years since my last panic attack, each panic attack I‚Äôve had was triggered by the subject or any reminder of my cousin. My father witnessed almost all my panic attacks.

8,"I want to be a psychologist, but I'm sick of what people say behind closed doors.","Hi Sorry for the long post, ive not really made a post before and my thoughts are all over the place at the moment.

Not many people I know professionally know that I have PTSD. It's something I've been made to be ashamed about after working on a psychiatric ward and now while I study my Msc.

I was on a 1:1 with a patient who was in the midst of a breakdown and was performing similar (and very distressing) behaviours as my abuser. When I asked my co-workers for help they told me they would come and assist. I was left waiting for 4 hours, (even though I was only supposed to be on 1:1 for an hour, as trust policy dictates). I told them that was not ok and to not do that again. They did it again the next shift I was with them.

At the next staff meeting I told the team about this incidence and how it should not be happening, if a staff member needs to tap out, they should be able to tap out. The manager said I was right to tell everyone and she would have words with the staff on shift that day. I was really happy to have had that conversation and to have it out in the air.

Fast forward to handover straight after the meeting, where there were 10 nurses in the nurses office, I was sitting down while everyone was standing around me. The manager walks in and says are we looking after \*my name\* or are we looking after the patients? Everyone, apart form one nurse who saw me burst out laughing. Another nurse said I shouldn't be in the job. I coughed loudly and everyone went quiet. I walked out and kept myself busy looking after my patients.

Another time my colleagues said they could never be friends with/date someone who has mental health issues.

Whilst studying my masters a student in my cohort noted how PTSD is a disease and that those with PTSD have deformed brains. Well yeah I have a deformed brain but its not my fault, I went through shit, and that effected my neurology as it would anyone.

&#x200B;

* Am I just being really sensitive?
* Is there anyone else out there who works in mental health that has experienced the same?
* Those who look after others are humans themselves, surely we're allowed to have mental health issues aswell?

&#x200B;

I think going through my own mental health issues actually made me a better nurse because I know the *depths* patients are talking about.

I'm just frustrated, I'm largely ok now, I have the occasional wobble here and there but I pick myself up and carry on fighting. I don't even know if I should carry on trying to be a psychologist. But I don't want the career I've always wanted to be another thing he has robbed from me

&#x200B;

p.s. **Please please please** reach out for help if you need it, don't be put off by a few vile creatures I've worked with.

I ran up with a tryna kit I keep in the car and he was stuck in the truck. I had to break through his windshield to get him out . 

After 2 minutes I got in and pulled him out . He had glass in his face and blood was Everywhere. Looking at him I realized I went to school with him and he was my teachers kid. I layed him down and looked for DNR signs (do not resuscitate) and he didn't have any so I proceeded to begin CPR. He woke up to tell me to call his dad and as I called the EMT came in to get him.  .

2,Shoutout to all of the people with PTSD that have horrible memories,"My memory has been deteriorating a lot over the last few months, and I recently learned that it probably stems from trauma. Apparently PTSD can wreak long-term havoc on the brain (which makes sense, I just hadn‚Äôt thought about it before) and has a particularly nasty effect on the hippocampus.

I‚Äôm young, maybe younger than most people on the sub, and memory loss has always been one of my biggest fears. So to learn that PTSD can permanently effect my memory and double my chance of developing dementia later on, is taking a toll on me. 

If anyone else has been affected like this, hi, you‚Äôre not alone. Shit sucks but we‚Äôll all get through it.

Edit: I didn't expect this to even hit Hot, but I'm so glad so many of us can relate, and all in different stages of it.

8,I realised today that I like myself!,"For the first time, in.. well, ever.

I'm not sure exactly what changed or when. But today, after I did something dumb (I don't remember what, something insignificant like walking into the door frame), the inner monologue said something like 'it's okay, I like myself'. 

It stopped me in my tracks - I don't remember ever thinking that before. I took a moment to look in the mirror and see myself from a positive, more objective perspective; not just in my appearance, but in the person I am.

And I am here to tell you, kids, that I saw it all, and I liked it. I didn't see some dumb, fat, dropout loser like my brain tries to portray me as. 

Instead I saw beauty. I saw a compassionate, weird, creative, fierce woman, who suffered trauma upon trauma but somehow overcame. Who even in the lowest points of her own life has never turned away a person in need. Who continues to grow and evolve into better versions of herself every day.

I'm telling you this partly because I'm proud of myself and wanna show off a little, but mostly because I want anyone and everyone out there who's struggling with themselves, to know that it's possible. It's not just something people say to make you feel better; it's real and it's attainable.

To other folk this would probably sound like the ramblings of a madman, but I feel like I've just raised Atlantis or some shit, and I knew you guys would get it.

11,"People diagnosed with PTSD, are you ever inexplicably drawn to or aroused by the type of abuse you went through? Do any of you purposefully trigger yourselves? What is your reaction to the triggering usually like when you do that? (TW)","(Im a survivor of sexual abuse in my childhood  but don‚Äôt have PTSD). It was an absolutely horrible thing which I have all kinds of complicated feelings towards. But even though my experiences were bad, I still am drawn to the abuse, almost aroused by it. Not in action of course, but only in my thoughts. After reading some threads here, I realised how common it is to almost fetishise your abuse as a way of coping, and how a lot of us feel ashamed for that too. Sometimes the abusers do things in a way that their victim‚Äôs body ‚Äúresponds.‚Äù 

In one thread here a woman was saying that when she was 5, her abuser was extremely patient and gentle and performed things in a way that her body responded and was aroused (and it‚Äôs of course still very traumatising nonetheless). But there was no ‚Äúviolence.‚Äù But isn‚Äôt that a criterion for PTSD? Is it possible to have PTSD from those kinds of experiences?


Also, as a survivor of sexual abuse, I know I seek out fictional material with sexual abuse or other kinds of dark subjects as it draws me strongly, and perhaps even arouses me. It ashames me that I‚Äôm this way but it‚Äôs a fact. Is this a way we purposefully trigger ourselves I wonder?

Are any of you who purposefully seek out things similar to your abuse, do you get triggered by it? What kinds of things do you seek out? If you aren‚Äôt triggered by it, then what triggers you? 

Second part of the question, do any of you purposefully trigger yourselves? How do you react to the triggering? 

I was reading some old threads on here about how people purposefully trigger themselves and that‚Äôs what had got me thinking. If you search ‚Äútrigger on purpose‚Äù you‚Äôll get some topics. Here are some examples of that: [#1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/fbkpjm/ptsd_triggers_on_purpose/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), [#2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/f3ocvn/i_trigger_myself_on_purpose/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), [#3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/g0lhbw/selftriggering/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). 

And also [this article](https://psychcentral.com/ask-the-therapist/2015/07/03/ptsd-cant-stop-purposely-triggering-myself/) is a more through and interesting example of that. 

A recap of the questions:

1. Are you sometimes drawn to or aroused by the abuse you went through? 

2. Do you seek those things out in a simulated way? Either by reading, watching, fantasising, role play, etc.? 

3. Do you get triggered when you do these things? If not, what tends to trigger you? If yes, what is your response like? 

4. Do you ever purposefully trigger yourself?(similar to what this woman explained [here](https://psychcentral.com/ask-the-therapist/2015/07/03/ptsd-cant-stop-purposely-triggering-myself/)). How do you react to this triggering? Is it milder than usual? Stronger?

I ask these questions because I was reading an article here about how those suffering from PTSD will go to ANY LENGTH whatsoever to AVOID that experience and anything that triggers them at all costs, whereas those suffering from some form of anxiety and who have past trauma will feel a very strong emotional response and discomfort instead, and that *that* is a distinction between both of these disorders.

That sounded a little different from what I‚Äôve read from people‚Äôs experiences on here. Is this that these people were not diagnosed with PTSD? That those suffering from PTSD will always try to avoid those experiences at any cost?

Thanks for the answers guys. Sorry if you found it intrusive or offensive in any way.

12,Witnessed my girlfriend having a PTSD episode for the first time,"Using a throwaway account for privacy reasons.

So I've been dating this girl for about two months, and I love everything about her. As cliche' as this sounds, she's been the greatest thing to ever happen in my life and I wouldn't trade her for anything. We're college aged lovebirds enjoying every moment together.

I've been staying at her place for about a week and tonight was the first time I've witnessed her PTSD episode come to fruition. Now, I already know about her condition and that she's had flashbacks and episodes before. This all stemmed from growing up with a mother who had multiple personality disorder to where during her mother's bad days she was abused heavily to the point of trauma. As of recent, my GF's episodes have been far less frequent and a lot better, and I personally have never seen it happen. 

Until tonight.

Earlier in the day, she mentioned about having hallucinations and seeing the wall turn from white to purple wavy colors. She mentioned it was really nothing and not bad at all. I put it in the back of my mind and paid no further heed, as the rest of the day was very much a happy one, albeit I did notice her seemingly tired a bit more. 

Tonight, we were laying in bed and after some merrymaking we were chilling and resting in silence. However, soon I started noticing tears form. She claimed it was nothing, but I knew better. I hugged her and held her close, then she started balling in my shoulder. As I have no experience, I did what I best thought I could do: I kept telling her everything is alright, I'm here, and I'll protect and be with her always no matter what, hugging her as tight as I could.

She continued for about thirty minutes in my arms, then seemed to have calmed down. She was less audible but she said she felt better. I turned on all the lights and currently have some of her favorite songs playing and get her comfortable enough to get some good sleep. 

I haven't had a deep conversation concerning the specifics of how her episodes manifest, what they're like, and how best to deal with them due to not wanting to instigate a possible episode. I've entered in this relationship knowing full well about her condition and I still love her anyways and want to be there even more and help her the best way possible. She's been seeing a therapist near our college since last year, until COVID-19 happened and we moved back to our respective homes from college. She said she dissociated a lot in the past and she's had a mental breakdown episode that lasted for two weeks last year that prompted her to start therapy. 

Anyhow, as someone who can say they don't have much experience with PTSD, how can I best help her as her boyfriend? As of now, I cannot physically be with her 24/7, so I'd love to know tips for long distance help as well. Just anything in general to help her through this condition and help her be as happy and feel as safe as possible.",glwwd3,150,1.0,26,2020-05-18 07:30:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/glwwd3/witnessed_my_girlfriend_having_a_ptsd_episode_for/,False,False,2020,5

16,does anyone else get overwhelmed/feel weird during sex scenes in movies?,"cw: parental abuse implication, porn mention

i'm a 20 going on 21 year old man and i'm really embarrassed to admit this, but whenever there's a sex scene in a movie or even a really raunchy one (like in the lewd rom-coms, y'know? i can't explain it), i feel really... weird, like i want to crawl out of my skin. 

my parents like unwinding in the evenings with netflix and hulu, which is totally cool and natural-- but they always seem to gravitate to these kinds of movies. (both of them being sexual in front of me, my father in particular, is a separate issue that i won't get into here, mostly for the sake of brevity) my mom likes horror movies, and a lot of them have some pretty weird/fucked up sexual scenes. it's kind of a nightmare living in the same house as two people who always blare movies like this, if i'm being honest.

i also have a hard time watching porn because of this. this wasn't really a problem until earlier this year, and it doesn't really affect me as negatively as the stuff i mentioned in the previous paragraph, but i still thought it was worth mentioning.

something about watching people be sexual with each other just makes me feel gross all over.

edit: forgot to mention that i don't care about sex jokes or sexual lyrics in music, nor do i consider myself an asexual. it's just the visuals that i'm not a fan of.",gpi2p6,132,0.99,26,2020-05-24 02:50:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/gpi2p6/does_anyone_else_get_overwhelmedfeel_weird_during/,False,False,2020,5

18,Crazy neighbour doesn't beleive me about my child!!! TRIGGER WARNING!!!," 

**backstory: so, i was r\*p\*d when i was 13 by my step-dad, i got pregnant and i chose to keep the baby. i moved in with my girlfriend and her parents. I am now 16 and my son Logan is now 19 months. It was not my choice to have him, but it was my choice to keep him. and he is the best thing that has ever happened to me.**

**story: My girlfriend's parents (who I live with) moved into a house which is two 4 bedroom houses connected together by a small door downstairs. Me and my girlfriend live together in one of the houses, and her parents live in the other. in our house we each have our own bedrooms, but tend to sleep in the same room, with Logan. he has his room which is more of a playroom at the moment because he still sleeps in a cot in our room. my gf takes pride in the fact that she always keeps the house clean and loves to clean. also, we still technically live with her parents.**

**we have regular social services visits to make sure that we are all OK because we are so young, she is 16 as well. our neighbours (not her parents but the ones next to us on our side) are entitled parents. and this week came to our house about 10 minutes before a social service visit. they started screaming at us for having a child so young. i have extreme social anxiety and ptsd from when i got pregnant with him. I don't tell anyone that i don't trust completely about his father. so our neighbours don't know about the circumstances about him.**

**on this particular day she sees me and my gf playing with our son in the garden. he is only wearing his underwear because it is a hot day and he is in the pool. and he has plenty of sun-cream on. she comes knocking on my gfs parents door. her parents tell her that we live next-door not with them. she comes and knocks on our door and is shouting about how we shouldn't be living on our own, and we should have a responsible adult in the house. she then starts shouting about how we probably abuse Logan. she then asks how old i am and i tell her i'm 16, she slaps me and tells me that i am way too young to have a child and that i'm lying to her about him being my son. i tell her that he is my son and i was just young when i had him. she slaps me again and calls the police telling them that I've kidnapped a child. i start having a flashback because it was a very triggering situation. she then starts saying that our house is a mess. my gf was so angry but at this point is focusing on my more than the woman. then she sees my son and accuses us of sexually abusing him because he is only wearing his underwear! this is too much for me and i pass out because that can happen in ptsd. once I had come around and calmed down the woman started telling me i was overreacting. so i just turned around and told her the truth ""I WAS RAPED, I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO DO IT! IT WASN'T MY FAULT"" remember i'm 16 so this was a pretty scary situation for me in this moment. the crazy neighbour looks horrified and starts calling me all sorts of racial and religious slurred. ( which doesn't make sense because i am white french living in England!) also, i am still in my wheelchair because i was using it in the garden, so she kicks my wheelchair and breaks it!**

**i turn around and the social worker had seen it all. the social worker explained to them woman that i was a teen parent, and then the police arrested the crazy neighbour! social services took her kids off of her during the trial! i pressed chargers and she was fined. she did get her kids back but she never bothered us again after that. all is going well now and social services were very happy about how we handled the situation!**",gcn5e0,131,0.91,43,2020-05-03 08:28:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/gcn5e0/crazy_neighbour_doesnt_beleive_me_about_my_child/,False,False,2020,5

However this is also a big time for me. I'm trying to quit self harm, trying to get a job and eventually move out. All of which are incredibly stressful. When I'm out on my own I'll not be able to afford a trauma therapist, at least not for a long while. So it's now or never. 

The difficult bit is that even lightly touching it is enough to put me out of commission for basically a day to two, sometimes more.

22,I blocked someone who causes me triggers and I feel better.,"Man. I told this person to leave me alone. Why?

She was a callous idiot after my accident. She broke my heart, and made me feel  so miserable just 2 days after my accident.  I cried even more because of that and i really wanted to die in that moment. 

After that, i was an idiot. I tried to forget that and give her another chance. 

Let's just say that she took advantage of my affected mental state and made me into a person who did what she wanted for a little comfort from her. But anyway. Half year later, i realized what she was doing to me, and how she even physically hurt me. So, i left her. And I made it clear to her to leave me alone. Thanks to the quarantine, now i could be away in all ways from her. 

Almost. Tonight she started following me on Instagram. I had a little trigger about the accident when i sawed the notification. I wasn't in panic, but it felt bad. So i decided to block her.

3,Think the stigma ever goes away? Think again.,"Two nights ago I had a pretty uncomfortable conversation with one of my best friends. I‚Äôm not sure if this necessarily has changed our friendship but it just reinforces that there is a long way to go with society‚Äôs view of mental health issues - especially in healthcare where they are ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to at least show some compassion in treatment.

But anyways, my friend is an ER nurse and no lie she works in a pretty rough spot. I know she‚Äôs got to see some shit every hour. I get that. I‚Äôm a school teacher at a rough school too. I get frustrated with shit. I know with my ptsd, I might have something in common with the harder students. So I keep an open mind and heart.

Anyways, that‚Äôs why it was hard when my friend started laughing and talking about one of the patients that came in. She gave me details, it was basically a man who was suffering at first what they thought was hallucinations/paranoia. Turns out he was a war veteran and experiencing severe flashbacks, talking to himself, screaming, flailing, you get the picture. 

I was shocked at her tone and how she was laughing, I suppose out of shock herself because she had to help restrain the man and called the cops to transport him to a different psych hospital. At the end of her story, I just said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think that could‚Äôve been me? What‚Äôs so funny about that?‚Äù

I could tell immediately she was thrown off and she just started insisting that no, mine was different and blah, blah, blah. Like no. That man and I might have different symptoms/circumstances but we‚Äôre still in the same boat. How am I supposed to feel when a health care professional has that attitude - and when that person knows the delicate details of my own condition? 

Sorry for this rant but I suppose I needed to get it off my chest. As I‚Äôm wondering how far we have to go in order to get people to understand us, have sympathy.

6,Trauma Is Like A Mold,"This analogy was told me to me when I was in an inpatient treatment facility for ptsd and it really helped me understand trauma, shame, ptsd etc. 

Trauma -and the shame it comes with- is like a mold. It grows and thrives in the dark, in closed off, damp places. Imagine mold growing in a closet in your home. You can close the door, and you won‚Äôt have to look at it or even really deal with it at all. 

The thing is, when you come back to check on it a year later, two years later, 20 years later, it won‚Äôt be the same as when you left it. It will have grown. A lot. 

Trauma is the same way. A lot of people understandably want to put off facing their trauma through therapy/treatment etc until they‚Äôre in a better place in their lives. It‚Äôs inconvenient and most people want to wait until they‚Äôre done with school or more comfortable at their new job etc etc. So a lot of people close the closet door and tell themselves it‚Äôs fine and they can look at it later when they‚Äôre more ready. 

When you come back to look at trauma later, it won‚Äôt be the same as you left it. It will have grown, a lot.

Shame and suffering grows when we hide it. It thrives off secrecy and alone-ness. The burden of hiding our pain from ourselves and others multiplies it. The burden of protecting others from our reality multiplies our shame. You will see people on this sub and in other areas of treatment who are just beginning their journey and they will say ‚ÄúI wish I dealt with this 20 years ago‚Äù. 

The way to begin addressing trauma is the same way we can begin addressing mold. We need to air it out. Open the closet and leave the door open. Let sunlight shine onto your trauma and let it be seen. We don‚Äôt have to keep it a secret anymore to protect ourselves or other people. I‚Äôve found that speaking the truth about what happened to us is the most terrifying thing in the world until it actually comes out of our mouths. The more we talk about it, the more we let the day light fall on it, the less power it will have over us.",hcmgw1,183,0.99,24,2020-06-20 13:41:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/hcmgw1/trauma_is_like_a_mold/,False,False,2020,6

10,Does anyone else feel attached to their trauma?,"trigger warning: violence

A little over five months ago, I was on a bus that crashed into a bus stop, killing four people. I wasn't injured myself but I tried to help two people on the bus, one of whom I watched bleed out in a very violent way and another who was panicking while I stayed with her for several minutes. I've since been diagnosed with acute PTSD. My trauma counselor and me recently arrived at the conclusion that I might actually be attached to my trauma--that I'm resistant to getting over it and that losing the feeling of urgency and intensity would feel like losing a part of myself.

Does anybody else feel a similar sense of attachment to their trauma, especially if it was acute/a specific event?

12,Anyone else have trauma resulting from inpatient mental hospital stays?,"Mental hospitals are fucking abhorrent environments, even in the 21st century. They cause far more harm than good toward most of their patients. I had the misfortune of being sent to two of them in 2018, and the second time was far worse (not that the first one was a picnic, mind you).

In August of that year I suffered a crippling nervous breakdown that was triggered by a myriad of factors, a breakdown that a now-ex-friend called a ""manic episode"". This resulted in me being cruelly misdiagnosed with Bipolar Disorder ""wItH pSyChOtIc FeAtUrEs"", which is a fucking crock of shit if ever I've heard one. I don't run around the streets naked screaming ""I'm God"", I don't smear my own shit on the walls, and I've never fucking hallucinated in my life. Yet still I am officially branded a psychopath. The only delusion I was under during this period was that I thought I actually *was* going insane. I went along with my torture because I was too weakened to advocate for myself.

If you want a detailed account of just what made my sentence in a nuthouse so abhorrent, look for a post I made entitled ""My trial by fire at Backwoods"" on the subreddit r/psychwardchronicles. I don't care to revisit all the gory details, you can see them for yourself on that post.

I will say right off the bat that these fucking cancerous institutions are committing a human rights violation by confiscating their patients' phones and music players. I know that sounds hyperbolic and whiny, but blasting music has always been a way to silence (or at least muffle) all the screams in my head. I mainly gravitate toward extreme metal because it screams for me when I can't scream myself. To deprive me of that in my most vulnerable and fragile moments is like breaking someone's legs and then kicking their crutches out from under them.

Oh, and not to mention witnessing daily brawls between patients, being surrounded by whackjobs who were way further off the deep end than myself, being forced to take zombifying doses of so-called ""anti-psychotic"" meds as a condition of your release, and patients getting forcibly injected in the asshole with Halidol. Those things weren't exactly pleasant. 

I still get frequent PTSD flashbacks to that Godforsaken shithole. I would like to go back there with my boyfriend though, just once, to take a piss on the grounds and smoke a joint and blow smoke in the useless amateur piece of shit p-doc's face. I think that would give me closure.

I don't believe in inpatient care. Only if a person is a credible threat to themself or another, and all other means of outpatient treatment have been exhausted, should sending a person to one of those places even be considered. 

I vow that I will never let myself be sent to another one of those ghettos of the soul for the rest of my life.

Anyone else unable to remember the majority of their childhood?","I just, can‚Äôt remember it. I know it happened obviously, but I have very scattered memories just kinda sprinkled throughout ages. I remember practically nothing from up to around age 8. One really horrific memory from around 8 or 9. Then scattered blips of memories till around 16.

14,I did something different last night.,"Bad memories often come up when I try to go to sleep. Instead of crying by myself like I usually do, I took a risk. I went to my mom's room where she was already sleeping and crawled into her bed.

Why is this a risk? Well, in years past, she's not been very understanding when I cry or get bothered over past events. The most devastating memory I have of her is her yelling at me for crying so loud to bother the neighbors. This was a couple months after my dad / her husband passed away. She often asked why I was so depressed when she was the one who lost everything. After that, I lost trust in her to show her my feelings. I would just cry alone at night whenever the feelings became overwhelming.

Slowly over the past couple years since I've moved back home, I've been working things out with her and she's reflected and apologized for not understanding how to help me. It's improved a lot, but I still never asked her for support whenever I cry at night.

Tonight, after a decade, my mother hugged me the way I wanted her to while I sobbed my heart out. 

It took some coaching to get here, but she did it. It felt like my hole inside heart started to mend. After I got all the crying out, she said she wished she could have helped me more.

We ended up chatted even more about random things, even ended up laughing during the conversation.

do you guys ever overshare? about your trauma specifically? sometimes i find that i can't help but talk about it. something mildly related will come up and i'll blurt out a ptsd joke or something (which usually falls flat, lol). it's always on my mind and i talk about it almost compulsively. i always feel really bad and sick afterward, because i honestly hate people knowing about it, and i'm sure they'll hate me now that i dumped something like that on them. but then i go and do the same thing a few days later. 

idk maybe this is just a me thing??

17,I am starting to get angry at him,"I was violently raped 20 yrs ago and pushed it away for nearly 20 yrs. I barely felt anything about it or about him.

I always thought that he  didn‚Äôt realize how badly he was harming me, even though there was blood, even though I was saying, stop, you are hurting me. Even though he was lifting my body up off the couch with every blow of his fist. 

Two days ago I was triggered and had to ride out some horrendous flashbacks.  And for the first time, as I felt myself back in the bathroom where I had gotten away from him, where I was trying to stop the slow of blood, I felt anger toward him. I realized: this man knew EXACTLY what he was doing. He knew he was being violent, he knew he was harming me. And I was probably not the only woman he raped so viciously. For the first time I wanted to kick down that bathroom door and come back at him... I wanted to kick him and pummel him and claw his face and scream until he heard me. I wanted to beat him bloody. For the first time I did not excuse him.

**He has** ***nothing*** **left**.

He has forfeited a high-paying licensed career, almost a decade of life outside prison now, his well-known local reputation, and probably his marriage. And, let's be real: the rest of his future.

And now he has to live out the rest of his life in the wreckage of everything he used to have. Plus 5-10 *extra* years in lockup.

""I'm going to end this man's whole career,"" I seethed ten years ago, helpless and blinded by untreated PTSD.

""It's okay, I'll ruin my own whole life,"" was his reply, apparently.

Life is pretty good nowadays on my end. I don't wake up screaming or begging anymore. I have a lot worth living for. Most days, I'm pretty happy.

Meanwhile, the man who ruined half a dozen lives is probably never going to be happy again. :)

3,Who else is so tired of being in survival mode constantly due to this unsafe world and your hypersensitivity to it with CPTSD?,"Who else is so tired of being in survival mode constantly due to this unsafe world and your hypersensitivity to it with CPTSD?

I usually am hypervigilant and quick to advocate for myself as a result of my trauma history--racial, sexual, and emotional abuse. I've spent a lot of my life being gaslighted and mistreated. I have become more confident in standing up for myself, setting boundaries and trusting my intuition these days. I love and respect myself and do not tolerate others who abuse or  disrespect my boundaries. I have always been assertive and have leadership qualities, so this is also part of who I am and who I have to be to survive. 

I want to live in a mental and physical space where I can let down my guard and calm my nervous system so I don't feel the need to put all my energy into advocating and fighting back every time with all my force as if I am dealing with racist, sexist, narcissists or sociopathic abusers everytime. This unsafe world is draining my energy as I frequently have to be in survival mode. When I do let my guard down, I am vulnerable to be attacked or preyed on--recently I have been experiencing racial and sexual harassment. 

((The world is not always unsafe of course, Sometimes there are just miscommunications and people are not out to get me or don't have deceitful intentions due to racism, sexism, etc. I have had to check myself when it was time to let an issue go as I am not able to control everything just myself. There have been times I was embarassed for jumping to conclusions and being overly suspicious and mad when someone was not being deceitful and there was a misunderstanding instead.))

I am working on finding safe physical, mental, and spiritual places where I do not feel the need to protect myself as much and can conserve my energy to heal from cPTSD. I cannot expect to heal as effectively when I am in a place where I keep getting burnt by more abuse. I need to be safe first. It is tough though because as a black mixed woman, there are a lot of places where I am not safe and I have to advocate for myself due to people being out to get me or mistreating me. I cannot wait to move next year to a place where I do feel safer and can let my guard down more and can heal my CPTSD.

Who else is struggling with being in survival mode constantly due to this  unsafe world and your hypersensitivity to it with CPTSD history?

Anyone else feel their cPTSD recovery is like a full time job?

Healing from PTSD has been the hardest but most important job I've ever had! I am so glad my real job is so low key that I am able to have more time to take care of myself.

There is a lot of crucial energy and time spent trying to heal from trauma such as processing the emotions from trauma during hard dreams/ triggers/flashbacks, educating myself about the abuse, the self care, mental health care, leaving toxic relationships, isolating, learning and setting boundaries, self parenting, etc ..

This hard work is paying off and I am so proud of myself and glad I love and care about myself enough to do it. I will never give up on myself, I am my number one advocate and supporter. Who else feels like recovery is like a full time job?

From eating disorders to self harm I've literally spent my whole life trying to keep my trauma out of my head. It's not a fixation, it's a disorder. Like depression or anxiety or any other. Anxiety isn't you fixating on panic. Depression isn't you fixating on sadness. I understand it's meant with good intentions but I take it as an insult. If I could take a pill to forget, I'd take it many times over.

9,I wish someone would've told me how healing running my own businesses could be... Instead everyone discouraged me because of my PTSD! + more thoughts on jobs and managing PTSD,"**EDIT:** Ahhh omg! My first Reddit award ü•∫!! After I posted this I had the usual PTSD self-doubt, worrying that y'all wouldn't understand, but of course YOU UNDERSTAND IT MORE THAN ANYONE!! I will be posting more here and hope to keep swapping stories and inspiration with everyone in this sub :)

&#x200B;

I have PTSD from an abusive relationship I had when I was 14-18 years old. I also have anxiety, OCD/dermatillomania, depression, and chronic pain.

I come from a family of entrepreneurs and was raised to be one. I have dabbled in a few different industries, spent a lot of time helping create and run newer nonprofits and community orgs. Now I'm working for a small tech company as a partner and I manage all my own clients, customer service, website, etc.

A couple years ago, I decided I really wanted to start my own business from the ground up, by myself. There was a few different reasons, mainly being that I wanted more freedom and ability to creative (my current work is monotonous as hell). Once I started digging further, I realized that I also wanted the freedom to live by my own schedule, and once I figured out why, it all came back to my PTSD.

As I'm sure you all know, there are days, weeks, months that are difficult to work through. Especially when you're in a company with strict attendance requirements or customer/client service. Even though I run my own stuff at my current day job, there is no flexibility when it comes to taking long breaks or avoiding customers. This can be really tricky to manage with PTSD :(

I faced a lot of discouragement when I started exploring options for businesses that I could run myself **that would also allow time for rest and recovery.** Everyone kept saying to me that ""making it"" would be impossible, too stressful, too much time, too much energy. But stubborn and determined like I always am, I kept researching a business model that I could gel with.

I paid for a lot of online courses and listened to a lot of ""experts"" who really believe they have the answer. I will admit that the haters were a little bit correct in that pursuing entrepreneurship is an energy drainer. BUT!! Through all the classes and mentorships, I learned one big fat lesson about running your own business - you have to deeply know yourself to be a successful entrepreneur. (I know everyone here struggles with knowing who your ""true"" self is... I know I do... so this lesson hit me HARD).

Why do you have to know yourself? Well, a million reasons. But the top ones - 1. You have to pick what your business is about, and in order to do that, you have to know what you like and don't like (not so easy for us w/ PTSD!!) and 2. You have to understand how you get shit done the best! Instead of following someone else's schedule and guidelines, you really have to craft your own, and in order to do that you have to kind of ""study"" yourself.

I did a lot of work and exercises related to this all in hopes of becoming a successful entrepreneur. And I realized that **a lot of that work was helping with my PTSD recovery, too.**

Anytime I disregarded my own ideas and tried someone else's because they were more successful etc., I would fail. Then I would stay true to who I am, the way I work, what I care about... and that's what worked.

Am I saying that entrepreneurship cures PTSD? Lol. Hell no. Is it a replacement for therapy and other forms of recovery? No.

BUT! As someone who has had a dream of being a successful entrepreneur my whole life - I really really really wish someone would've told me **all the healing and positive parts of having PTSD and running my own biz.** Instead of just throwing discouragement at me.

I could talk about this forever... I know this is a long post, but I wanted to share in case anyone else on here has **ever felt discouraged from pursuing self-driven or creative work.** You don't have to sit in an office all day and play by the rules. You also don't have to work a million hours and stress yourself into panic attacks. You can pursue what you want with self-care and your PTSD does NOT make it impossible. In fact, sometimes I think the resilience and stamina I have because of my PTSD *actually helps me*.

I'd be curious to hear anyone else's thoughts on careers and running a business and how their PTSD helps or hurts.

Anyway, my psychiatrist said that only people who have been in war can suffer from PTSD.  That goes against everything that I have read on the subject.

I can't even watch the video George Floyd because it'll give me flashbacks. My abuser used to pin me down and sit on me when he thought I was too ""out of hand"" (I wasn't, I was usually just upset when he did this). He wouldn't get off until I calmed down, despite me telling him I would call down if he just got off of me.

I have autism and sensory processing, so it was only harmful to me. I can't even describe it. I won't go into detail, but it was horrible.

He ignored my pleas every time. He refused to listen when I said it only hurts me. I remember that I've even said ""I can't breathe"" and he didn't listen.

I can still recall his weight on me. How I felt like I couldn't breathe. How I begged for him to get off of me, but he wouldn't listen. How he would then play the victim because of the marks I left when I reacted to what was practically torture for me. How one time my mom was begging for him to get off of me, which he ignored.

4,Update on predator lurking this sub. TW CSA,"I‚Äôll try keep it short because we had a post like this not too long ago but I‚Äôve got new info I wanted to share. 

There is a person lurking this sub who has gone by previous usernames such as ‚Äúcoder‚Äù and ‚Äúisusha‚Äù. They started by messaging me with something along the lines of ‚Äúhey I saw your post on X and I was hoping I could just vent to you. Awaiting your reply‚Äù 

They say they are a minor being abused. When you engage them they are extremely insistent on NOT calling CPS or the cops. They say they just want to vent and they eventually just want to describe the abuse to you. 

I didn‚Äôt report it immediately because i was worried it might be an actual confused child :(
But another user messaged me the other day saying she had received the exact same kind of messages from ‚Äúcoder‚Äù (his old username). 

I think it‚Äôs safe to say this person is going to a lot of these subs and messaging people. Since they have created new usernames and deleted old ones I also think it‚Äôs safe to say they will continue this behavior. 

I‚Äôm sure there are other people like this lurking as well. I just wanted to share this persons particular narrative and method to help you guys identify them if they try writing you from a new username. 

Stay safe everyone. I know this sucks but we are adults now who can make safe choices and I am trying to see this as an opportunity to practice setting boundaries, and standing up to creeps. The younger me would have given this abuser endless empathy and tried to help them/given them the benefit of the doubt that they were a child in need. 

I feel empowered that I am learning to trust my intuition!

6,Technique for intrusive memories,"I come from Scandinavia. We fish a lot, in wooden boats on the fjords. And the sea is so vast, deep, blue and endless. If we catch a fish you cannot eat, we unhook it and toss it back into the sea. Where it swims away, into the deep.

So, when I try to sleep and intrusive memories pop up. I think ""back into the sea"", catch and release. And I imagine just letting it go and how vast ocean is, and how it is room for it there. Then I actively focus on daydreaming about something cozy and pleasant instead. So that cozy fills my mind. And strangely, this works a lot of the time. While many other things have failed completely.

Of course, when I eventually end up sleeping its out of exhaustion more than anything, but it's better than the dreadful feeling of going to sleep without knowing who or what could end up waking me.

22,20 Fast interventions for panic and dissociation.,"**Body**

1. **Choose a particular group of muscles and try to maintain awareness of them despite the panic or dissociation. Tense them as tightly as you can and then force them to relax. Stay with the experience of the muscle group trying to relax.** 
2. **Choose a food with a strong flavor like mint, chocolate, cheese, or a pickle. Hold the food on your tongue and stay mindfully aware of the sensation of taste. Notice how different parts of your tongue taste different flavors.**
3. **Find something with a strong texture, like a soft blanket or a cool stone. Feel the item and be mindful of the experience. Try and pull yourself back into the world around you through the connection.** 
4. **Smell a strongly scented item, like peppermint oil or a scented candle. If possible choose a scent that reminds you of a pleasant place or memory. Try and reconnect with your senses and your environment by experiencing the strong smell. Notice what the smell makes you think about or feel in your body.**
5. **Laying under an ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù blanket or weighted blanket can be a stimulating somatic experience. If you don't have one, try lying under several heavy blankets to slow your heart rate and calm down.** 
6. **Rub a mentholated lotion around the neck and chest when you notice panic starting. There are many brands like Blue Stop ‚Ñ¢ that are marketed for arthritis and muscle pain. The cooling sensation can help you reconnect with your body and slow your heart rate.** 
7. **Wrap a frozen bag of peas in a towel and put it across your forehead and eyes. This will activate the body‚Äôs natural ‚Äúdive response‚Äù.  When the head becomes colder than the rest of the body, your body thinks it is diving into deep water and will slow your heart rate and relax muscles to save oxygen.**

# Mind

1. **Make a mantra about the fear, negative belief, or trigger for your panic or dissociation. This should be something that reminds you that you are ok and that the belief about the trauma is not true right now. Eg. ‚ÄúI am safe, I am free‚Äù or ‚Äúmy past is not my future‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am loving, I am loved‚Äù. Repeat the mantra to yourself when you notice the distressing belief taking hold.** 
2. **Break down what you are currently doing into a series of steps, and repeat back to yourself the steps of what you are doing in a deconstructed way. Remember that you are competent and that these are easy things to do. Eg. ‚ÄúI am turning on my blinker at the intersection‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am putting peanut butter on the bread‚Äù.**
3. **Go through your phone or a mental calendar of future events and realize that this moment is just one part of the rest of your life. Go through your schedule and realize that right now is just one minute of the next hour of the next day of the next week of the next year. Think about things that you are excited to do in the future. Think of ways you can prepare for them.** 
4. **Try and put your finger on the exact emotions that you are feeling. ‚ÄúOverwhelmed‚Äù or ‚Äúfreaked out‚Äù are not emotions. Try and specifically describe your experience. Ask yourself if your current reality necessitates this experience. Try and discover if you are feeling scared, vulnerable or angry in this moment. If so, try and figure out who or what you are directing these emotions toward.**  
5. **The ‚Äústuck memory‚Äù of the trauma remembers the muscle groups that were tightened during the trauma. It remembers the way that you wanted to move your body's posture to protect yourself. Most importantly it remembers the way that you felt about yourself during the trauma. you may have wanted to curl up into a ball or stand up and fight. You may have thought that you were dirty, weak, small, or foolish. remind yourself that the traumatic belief you had about yourself during the trauma is not true. Also, try and move your posture into the opposite position the trauma belief makes it want to move into. Relax all muscle groups that want to tighten.**

# Soul 

1. **Think of an object or a place that you find beautiful. Look up a picture on your phone if you have access to one. Think about what you find beautiful about this object or place. Notice all of the things that you appreciate about the beauty of this place or object. Eg. pictures of the beach or a famous painting or sculpture** 
2. **Think about someone you love and feel safe with.  Think about what it is that you love about them. Think about this person and try and cultivate compassion for them. Feel yourself move from isolation to connection, and fear to compassion. If a word or phrase jumps out at you that represents this relationship to you, then repeat it to yourself in your head. Eg. Trust, kindness, safety**
3. **Think of your whole life like a giant web. Imagine yourself at the center and the strands of the web as your connections to others. Think of all the people that you love. Imagine where they are right now and when you will see them again. Imagine that the strings of the web run out from you to where your loved ones are in the world..** 
4. **Creativity requires us to get outside our own immediate experiences and reconnect with our resilient self. Draw a picture with anything you have, pen and napkin or toe in the dirt. Think about how you want to feel and try and express that feeling however you can. Hum a tune or sing a song if that is more appealing to you. When you feel that you are out of the immediate experience of the panic or dissociation, do a more complex creative activity that you find healing. Bake a cake, paint pictures, write a short poem, or make yourself do a small home improvement project. Reconnecting with our creative image and spatial processing part of the brain allows us to draw new connections and create new learned experience that helps us process trauma.** 
5. **Go to a space that you find calming, spiritual, or that feeds you in a personal way. Walk in the woods, sit by a lake, bird watch, attend a religious service, watch a theater piece, or go for a scenic drive. Find a space where you feel like you are calm, safe, and can start to be yourself again.**  
6. **Try to find your center or mindful self during the experience of the panic or dissociation. Think about the essence, psyche, or soul of yourself as a person. Feel how this anxiety, panic and dissociative episode is holding you back from being present like you would like to be. Ask yourself, what in me do I need to leave behind so the rest of me can become what I want to be? Ask yourself, what enlarges what I am, and what restricts who I am? Visualize yourself taking off or moving away from the anxiety experience. Realize that it is hurting you and not helping you right now. Try and feel yourself leave some of it behind so your mindful self can become more present.**

Then a few weeks later I would have one negative thought, then talk it out with my husband, and next thing I know, I'm having panic attacks again. 

I have panic attacks at least once a month I'd say, coupled with a sleepless night full of crying, shaking and self-loathing, and sometimes suicidal thoughts.

8,I stood up to a bully today/," I was working, just doing my job. A vendor with whom I was working became very aggressive during negotiations. I recognized he was trying to take advantage of me, so I held my ground. He then charged at me, invaded my personal space and threatened to knock me out. He also wasn't wearing a mask and was spitting everywhere, mind you.
But I wasn't even scared, or anxious. I was actually angry. My fight or flight clicked into fight for the first time in my life. He was a big guy and stood in my face and told me he was going to hit me, and I told him to just hit me. It's strange but as big as he was, he looked small to me. Like he couldn't even hurt me if he wanted to.
Anyway, he stood down and I left, then told my boss about what happened and that I won't be going back. The panic began after the incident and is still happening right now.

10,People refusing to take responsibility for causing trauma,"I think someone refusing to even acknowledge that they caused you years of fucking grief, years of pain, years of feeling dead inside, years of panic... I think that‚Äôs more infuriating than having c/ptsd itself. 

My mom is a paranoid schizophrenic and emotionally and physically abused and neglected me and my brother and outright refuses to believe she was anything but a good mom. She‚Äôs literally said to me that she was a great mom and that /I/, the literal child, abused HER. When I reminded her how she threatened to kill me in my sleep and how she told my little brother she was gonna smash his head into the wall because he was being loud, she told me I was lying and that I made it all up. 

My foster parents gaslit me and my brother too, and they still stand by that they were the victims somehow even though CPS determined them to be neglectful too and took my brother out of their home (I‚Äôd already aged out). 

I had a situation happen to me earlier this year where I started dating a guy who seemed completely perfect for me, who wanted to be in a relationship, who was communicating and open and I‚Äôd let my defenses down and been emotionally vulnerable with him, let him be more affectionate with me than I‚Äôve ever let anyone be... just to find out he had another girl he was seeing long term (4 years) and just never committed to her, but he was talking about adopting her kids, talking about marrying her, he even spent Valentine‚Äôs Day with the both of us..... and I didn‚Äôt even hear the news from him. SHE texted me at random and he denied it up and down but then kicked me to the curb with no explanation. She said really vicious, horrible things to me that triggered me for literal months. Now they‚Äôre in a relationship and apparently a happy one. I know it‚Äôs not healthy but I keep checking her stupid Facebook page. They‚Äôve gotten a puppy, bunnies, she checks in when they go on dates and they go on dates all the time. I was just completely discarded, with no explanation, and now I have to watch how he chose this other chick who‚Äôs even an anti-masker and anti-vaxxer instead of me . 

I messaged him a few months ago and told him how much what he did to me made me spiral down and how much trauma it caused for me. And he somehow doesn‚Äôt think he did anything to hurt me. He acts like he did absolutely nothing and like I‚Äôm being crazy or something for being so distraught to find out that someone I got so vulnerable with just ripped the rug out from underneath me and was lying and manipulating me the entire time I was with them. I‚Äôve never, ever in my life been triggered into trauma episodes every day for months before this happened. And he won‚Äôt even acknowledge that what he did was wrong. He won‚Äôt even acknowledge that he did what he did at all!! 

I‚Äôm so infuriated by these manipulative ass abusive people who traumatize us and then don‚Äôt even give us the sliver of respect to admit that they did.",il02rm,135,1.0,12,2020-09-02 04:23:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/il02rm/people_refusing_to_take_responsibility_for/,False,False,2020,9
11,A lesson from someone who lost their battle to PTSD.,"Hello. I was diagnosed officially I think a few months ago, probably actually had it for longer. My trauma stemmed from a relationship, but that‚Äôs not important. I took literally all the wrong routes on the road to recovery. I‚Äôm at the end of my road now. I‚Äôm fresh out of energy. Hurt. Hopeless. My only solace is since I screwed up an extreme amount, I can impart a lot of knowledge on to others. 

First, stay the fuck away from drugs. Especially the ones people tell you to , you know, stay away from. They‚Äôll make you feel great, amazing. Then you‚Äôll need them to function. Life without them will be so, so dull. It‚Äôs like having a heavy suitcase you never knew you was carrying taken away from you. Just... don‚Äôt. Please.

Second, never, ever RELY on one person. I did. Said they‚Äôd be there for me while I healed. Said they‚Äôd love me. Said they‚Äôd even help me get comfortable back on my campus. They ghosted around 4 days ago. A friend shown me their Tinder today. Of course, accept help. Love. Live life. But relying on someone like that, EXPECTING them to always be there, is a disaster. You need to be fully capable of being alone. I have no idea how to do this 

Third, keep trying meds. Switch therapists if it calls for it. Try, try, try. Misery is such an easy thing to get comfortable with. Keep moving. Always improve.",ion88q,125,0.99,24,2020-09-08 04:36:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/ion88q/a_lesson_from_someone_who_lost_their_battle_to/,False,False,2020,9

15,Is it possible to forget a trauma experience but have PTSD?,"Just as the title says. To preface, I AM diagnosed with PTSD and do have a set of trauma experiences I can recall vividly and experience PTSD symptoms around, but I keep feeling this bugging feeling that something in my early childhood has been extremely traumatic and that I have yet to remember it/can‚Äôt remember it. I‚Äôll get all the symptoms of being triggered at any mention of childhood or childhood trauma, even if it‚Äôs not even about me but just any random child, it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt listen without feeling triggered by it even though I‚Äôm a 22 year old adult now. I also just have extreme anxiety and fear surrounding my childhood (will have outbursts of fear and crying hysterically about it) but I ironically have memory loss of a majority of my life before the age of 18, except for quick snippets at random intervals. 

Has anyone experienced this? Does it come back to you eventually? Is it better forgotten? If it‚Äôs forgotten but the feeling is there, do I tell my therapist? He has been prompting me to recall and retell my traumas recently in trauma therapy, but how can I even do that if a big part (but not all) of my anxiety/nightmares/etc is because of something I can‚Äôt even remember?",iz01ge,125,1.0,50,2020-09-24 16:05:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/iz01ge/is_it_possible_to_forget_a_trauma_experience_but/,False,False,2020,9
16,PTSD and jump scares,"I'm a 22y/o with PTSD (mostly from a stalker/peeping tom about a year ago) and MDD. I'm feeling so weak today. This morning my friend/roommate jumped out from a closet to scare me (she thought it'd be funny), I screamed and literally fell to the floor and moments later was engulfed in a panic attack + one of the worst series of vivid flashbacks I've ever had. I've never had that happen so painfully in front of someone. She's someone who knows I have PTSD and knows a lot of what I've been through, so I guess I was even surprised she would think that would be funny, I don't blame her though, there's no way she could have known how that would affect me.

17,"My abusive ex called me after 3,5 years of no contact and it triggered my ptsd","So my (23f) ex (22m) and I were in a relationship when I was 18. We were together for a year before I broke up with him because he was so abusive.
He used to hit me, gave me a black eye, choked me, told me I deserved all of it, isolated me and made me lose all of my friends and even had me write down rules he had for me.

He was my first bf and it broke me. A month after I broke up with him I met my current bf and we have been together for 3,5 years now, he is amazing. Has always been very patient with me and convinced me to get therapy. I was in therapy for ptsd for a year and it helped a lot. I'm still not where I want to be but I'm ALOT better.

Last night at 10.30 pm I was watching a tv show with my bf and an unknown number called me. I did recognize it from somewhere but I couldn't remember from where. My bf decided to call the number with his phone because he knows I hate being called by random people. A guy picked up and they had a short conversation where my bf asked him why he called me and who he was. The guy just said it didn't matter and hung up.

I recognized his voice immediatly and I had trouble breathing. My bf asked me if I was okay and if I wanted to call him myself. I did and when he picked up he said he called me by accident which I dont believe. I could only get an ""okay"" out of my mouth before he said goodbye and hung up. But I am still freaked out about it.

My boyfriend was really sweet after it happened and kept hugging me and telling me that I'm in good hands now. I just can't get it out of my head. I also had trouble sleeping.

18,Learned something new from OBGYN,Backstory: had an ovarian cyst rupture the other day. I had to go for a pelvic exam to make sure it was draining properly and that there were not more cysts. Being that I just turned 21 I had not gotten an exam before. That being said when she was doing the exam she had hinted at the fact that I had pelvic floor problems. My muscles were too tight and as a result I had problems trying to hold a kegel. When I asked her if there was something I could do to train my body and why it happens she told me that it‚Äôs normal for women who have had sexual abuse. Sexual abuse is so common and I am so mad that we are not taught about the physical effects that stick with us! I‚Äôve been in therapy for a while to address my complex PTSD yet no one has ever actually talked to me about the fact that pelvic floor disorders are common for sexual assault victims (with vaginas).,isnyia,118,1.0,28,2020-09-14 16:12:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/isnyia/learned_something_new_from_obgyn/,False,False,2020,9

20,Human Trafficking Is Absolutely Terrifying!,"The thing about intuition is that you can only sense it before it happens, but it doesn't tell you when or how it's going to happen, and it doesn't tell you how to protect yourself from the danger that gave you the feeling in the first place. I questioned what made this movie about human trafficking give me the feeling that something terrible was going to happen to me, yes, what happened in the movie can happen in real life, but I couldn't even imagine something like that happening to me, because I was fat. A year later, when I was in my twenties, I lost weight, and later, my life began to spiral, and that's when an older guy I met introduced me to cocaine. A few months later he said he is in love with me and asked how I felt about him, I told him he is a great guy, and a great friend, but I love him more like a brother, I apologized to him for not feeling the same, he said it‚Äôs okay, he understands, he‚Äôs cool with it and I don't have to be sorry. Nothing changed, we hung out twice and everything was okay and normal, on the third day I had such a terrible feeling but I didn't care because I needed cocaine to feel better, as I pulled into the parking lot to meet him, that feeling grew stronger so I asked him if he could come inside my car this time, but he said no because he had already taken it out of the bag and prepared it for me in his car. After I closed my window, I told myself to just relax, because today is no different from any other day, I didn't trust my words of reassurance, so I left my car doors unlocked and when I sat in his car I left the door open with my leg hanging out the door, he asked me to close the door, and I said I can‚Äôt because my car is unlocked, that I had to be able to attack whoever tried to steal it, he didn't ask me again, and that calmed me down. He waited until I was high off the cocaine to offer me the weed, I took a few hits and started choking, but he had a full bottle of water for me. As the drugs began to take effect, he started driving with my leg still hanging out the door, if I hadn't been so high, I would have thought to jump out of the car, but instead I shut the door. I have smoked weed before and I mixed it with cocaine, mixed drugs with other drugs and alcohol but none of them had an effect on me like this, something must have been in the water, I think I blacked out, when I opened my eyes we were on the highway, I asked where  are we were going, and then I fell asleep, I kept waking up and passing out. One of the times I woke up, I remember hearing him say that he sells woman and makes a lot of money, and then I fell back asleep, I slept the rest of the way, and when he woke me up, we were parked in someone's driveway. We walked into the house and there was a man standing there with a bottle of vodka, he ordered me to drink it, I said no, and then he and the guy who kidnapped me forced it down my throat. I remember the house, there was no furniture, and in the bedrooms there was a mattress in each room with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress did not have a bed frame or any furniture. As the two guys spoke in the kitchen, I had the worst feeling I ever had in my life, the l human trafficking movie had crossed my mind, I thought I was never going see my family again, as high and intoxicated as I was, I had to try to find a way out of that house, because I didn't want to find out what might happen to me. I walked into one of the bedrooms to see if I could open the window just in case I needed to quickly escape, the curtain was dark, and the window was boarded up, I remembered when my kidnapper told me he loved me so I asked him if I could speak to him in private, I said it was really important because I can't keep this secret any longer than I have, he walked up to me and asked what is it? I said I lied when I told him I love him like a brother because I was afraid if I was honest with him, it would hurt me if I ever lost him. He asked if I was serious, I said yes and I hugged him tightly, he was totally shocked, excited, and then he told me he will be right back because he had to call off a deal he had made with his friend, I was standing in the empty living room when I heard a glass bottle shatter and I was afraid the friend of the guy who kidnapped me had killed him. When my kidnapper walked into the living room, unharmed, I felt so relieved, the other guy was also unharmed, as we were heading towards the door, I turned my head to the kitchen and saw the bottle of vodka shattered in pieces on the floor, and the guy seemed really angry, because he was silent when I said goodbye to him. On the car ride back to the Walmart where my car was parked, he told me that the deal he made with the guy was not his friend, it was his client, and the deal he made was to sell me, that man was going to buy me, with real money, buy me when I am a human being, not an object. He informed me that the house I had been taken to was the first stop, and I was going to be transported to another house somewhere else, I asked him which location and he said his client couldn't tell him because he knows me personally, it's a security thing to prevent him from coming back to pick me up if he changed his mind after I had been sold. He said he just wanted to be honest with me because he didn't want the beginning of our relationship to begin with a secret hidden from me, especially when it is a secret that involves me, I knew I had to watch what I say because my behavior and my actions were closely monitored, and I was petrified to be taken back to that house. I said, I forgive you baby, because I understand that some people just have to do whatever it takes to make money to support their families, I know that your father had passed away and you are trying to take care of your mother, I said this doesn't change my love for you, nothing ever will change that, he smiled and kissed me, he believed me, he held my hand, and I made sure I didn't let go while I was awake, I felt like it was the right time to close my eyes and sleep because I was still high and intoxicated, so I told him I was going to take a nap, he said, go ahead baby, I love you, and I said I love you too baby. When he woke me up, we were parked next to my car, still feeling petrified that he would take me back to that man's house, as he closely observed my reaction when I looked at my car, I had to keep playing it cool until I was safe, I said in a funny way, wow, nobody stole my car when the doors are all unlocked, he laughed, and then we hugged and kissed each other goodbye, I sat inside my car, acting like I was doing something as I was waiting for him to drive away, and after he drove off, I broke down in tears and thought of all the girls in the world who are victims of human trafficking, all the girls who are being held captive, my heart breaks for them and my heart goes out to them all. I know that I have no right to say that I know how it feels to be a victim of human trafficking, but I felt the terror that comes with it, the fear that I will never see my family again, and the end of my life as I knew it before. This was by far the scariest and most traumatic day I had ever experienced in my life, please do not tell me that I am lucky to have escaped, or that this makes me a brave person because I am not. I feel disgusted with myself and I feel so incredibly guilty for what I said to him, I hate myself for feeling so petrified that I had gone so far as to pretend to be okay with the fact that he sells innocent woman to make money, I wish I said screw my life and stood up for all the victims of human trafficking, I am so sorry.

I was exposed to domestic violence throughout my entire childhood, watching my dad beat up my brother (who was the only real friend I had, I was so alone as a child), starve him and he would always verbally abuse all of us. My mom would never say anything I think she also hated my brother. When I was 10, I accidentally realised he is actually my cousin and not my brother (no one ever cared to explain this to me), he then left us and eventhough I see him now, we never lived as a family again.

23,PTSD from riots. Feeling so alienated,"I live in a city where there was significant rioting at the end of May. I was present some nights of protesting and rioting, and live in the neighborhood where riots occurred. the area I live in is also low income, has a lot of homeless people and encampments that the cops keep sweeping. It's been pretty miserable and things are only getting worse. Ever since the riots I've been on edge waiting for there to be more protests around me.

I live near a hospital with a helipad and when the helicopters get too loud I freak out. Last night a shit ton of cop cars were lined up outside my house getting ready to arrest protesters. I could hear them joking around in their cars from my porch. I can see everyone around me on edge. At some point it hit me how fucking hard it is to live this way.

The protesters never made me feel unsafe. Even people rioting and looting didn't worry me that much. It was the fucking nazis running around and the cops tear gassing me and my friends and laughing while they bulldoze tents.

And I have to go about my life like everything is normal. I work as a college TA and I feel so disconnected from everyone. It feels like they've been living in a completely different city from me these last three months. I can't even give a fuck about COVID anymore. I feel like I couldn't even begin to tell most people everything that happened to me this summer. Like they wouldn't even believe me or if they did they'd be horrified.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the kind words and advice. I was hesitant to post because I know that the critics of these protests can be quite loud, but I'm very pleased that there were very few ass holes (one got deleted by a mod before I even saw it, thanks for that). I'm feeling much better than I did when I made this post, I was really shaken by all the cops outside my house and once I was able to be alone with my thoughts I lost it for a bit.

RE: Therapy I definitely have reservations about it for a number of reasons but I'll definitely be looking into some work I can do on my own and possibly EMDR since I've had it recommended before.

24,Came dangerously close to ending it last night,"I didn't mean to. I'm a retired Army veteran with 6 combat deployments. I've struggled with suicide in the past related to my ptsd. I was medically retired in 2017 for a plethora of things including PTSD. This was after 17 years of service.
Last night, things were really dark for me... Feeling disproportionate anger and uncontrollable depression. My wife of 15 years and I were fighting. I don't have any guns as my wife doesn't want them around the kids (12 and 14 yrs old). I did have a razor sharp knife (a Karambit) and I was quick it moving from hand to hand, wrist to wrist, wondering how quickly the end would come for me.. before I talk sized it, I hit my wrist, slashing and stabbing into my skin just shy of my radial artery and vein. It didn't really hurt as I have nerve damage in my arm so I didn't feel the initial cut. I didn't really think about killing myself, it was more passive suicidal ideation. I was lucky I was wearing a rain jacket. It kept the blood pooled in the sleeve. It was about 6 to 8 oz. I was able to use direct pressure and used an alganate bandage to help stop bleeding... Didn't say anything to my wife about it. Just told her my jacket got dirty and I nicked my arm. No big deal.

26,How to deal with embarrassment after having a flashback in front of other people?,"A few nights ago I was in a car, drunk, when the driver (my friend) got pulled over. That immediately triggered me and I started to hyperventilate. It took over two hours for me to calm down (after uncontrollable sobbing and multiple panic attacks). I definitely ruined the mood for the night. I even got me and some of my friends kicked out of the place we were supposed to be staying at, simply due to the fact that I was making the host uncomfortable. 

Everything is a blur, but according to some of my friends, I pissed off a lot of people that night. I‚Äôm absolutely humiliated- in front of a group of 12ish people, some of whom I barely know, I broke down and had one of the worst flashbacks of my life. Many of the people dislike me now, and I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

This is effecting me a lot more than I would like to admit.  The memories, the triggers, and above all, the pure humiliation just from thinking about it is absolutely energy draining. Flashbacks are already really hard to deal with, but on top of that the negative social aspect of it all really took a toll on me.

27,"DAE have the most gruesome, horrifying, gory nightmares with precise detail?","I've had ptsd for over 5 years, and only in the past few months I have progressed to nightmares I never thought anyone could experience. If I could describe them, it would be like they are traumatizing - doubt it, but that's how it feels during the dream.

Usually they involve someone(s) trying to murder me. They hunt down and murder other people and then progress to me, and its a very long torturous dream and the way they murder people is extremely creative in gore. I think the storyline is linked to someone in real life who was going to murder me at one point, on a daily basis, and I spent most of my life trying to escape and convince this person not to kill me, so I can see the link. What I don't get is why recently they are now extraordinarily, shockingly gory and detailed. Its like the bloody, creative deaths you'd see in some artsy horror film, and I rarely ever have watched horror films, and get turned off by gore. I have no interest in thinking up creative gore scenes where people are tortured and murdered slowly and horribly, but that is what my dreams are now about. I have seen shit you would never think someone could dream up or imagine. I have never seen a film with shit like this in it. \*\*I don't know where my brain gets these ideas from\*\*.

Before they got extreme, they were still horrifying, same kind of storyline, trying not to get killed, being tortured, but not so vivid, not so gory, not gory x 1000. I wake up from these dreams and cry. I never want to go back to sleep. They do not happen every night. I can't figure out if something in my life triggered this. I have no idea why I get them this bad now. The dreams themselves feel traumatizing, because I believe it is happening during them, I believe my life is in danger. 

Does anyone else connect with this? Do you have an idea why my nightmares have changed and gotten so much worse? Why I have gore in them to a level unimaginable when I don't even watch gore, and nothing specifically bloody gory I witnessed before....horrifying shit I've seen, but not gore. Definitely threats of gory things happening to me and people I loved, but it didn't happen.....shit guys I didn't even think it was possible to have dreams like these.",j239hi,104,1.0,59,2020-09-29 16:58:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/j239hi/dae_have_the_most_gruesome_horrifying_gory/,False,False,2020,9
0,Extreme Independence is a Trauma Response,"
The inability to receive support from others is a trauma response.

Your ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need anyone, I‚Äôll just do it all myself‚Äù conditioning is a survival tactic. And you needed it to shield your heart from abuse, neglect, betrayal, and disappointment from those who could not or would not be there for you.

From the parent who was absent and abandoned you by choice or the parent who was never home from working three jobs to feed and house you.

From the lovers who offered sexual intimacy but never offered a safe haven that honored your heart.

From the friendships and family who ALWAYS took more than they ever gave.

From all the situations when someone told you ‚Äúwe‚Äôre in this together‚Äù or ‚ÄúI got you‚Äù then abandoned you, leaving you to pick up the pieces when shit got real, leaving you to handle your part and their part, too.

From all the lies and all the betrayals.

You learned along the way that you just couldn‚Äôt really trust people. Or that you could trust people, but only up to a certain point.

Extreme-independence IS. A. TRUST. ISSUE.

You learnt: if I don‚Äôt put myself in a situation where I rely on someone, I won‚Äôt have to be disappointed when they don‚Äôt show up for me, or when they drop the ball... because they will ALWAYS drop the ball EVENTUALLY right?

You may even have been intentionally taught this protection strategy by generations of hurt ancestors who came before you. 

Extreme-independence is a preemptive strike against heartbreak.

So, you don‚Äôt trust anyone.

And you don‚Äôt trust yourself, either, to choose people.

To trust is to hope, to trust is to be vulnerable.

‚ÄúNever again,‚Äù you vow.

But no matter how you dress it up and display it proudly to make it seem like this level of independence is what you always wanted to be, in truth it‚Äôs your wounded, scarred, broken heart behind a protective brick wall.

Impenetrable. Nothing gets in. No hurt gets in. But no love gets in either.

Fortresses and armor are for those in battle, or who believe the battle is coming.

It‚Äôs a trauma response.

The good news is trauma that is acknowledged is trauma that can be healed.

You are worthy of having support.
You are worthy of having true partnership.
You are worthy of love.
You are worthy of having your heart held.
You are worthy to be adored.
You are worthy to be cherished.
You are worthy to have someone say, ‚ÄúYou rest. I got this.‚Äù And actually deliver on that promise.
You are worthy to receive.
You are worthy to receive.
You are worthy.

You don‚Äôt have to earn it.
You don‚Äôt have to prove it.
You don‚Äôt have to bargain for it.
You don‚Äôt have to beg for it.

You are worthy.
Worthy.
Simply because you exist.

3,I wish people understood the way triggers work,"Although lots of my triggers are very reasonably ‚Äúscary‚Äù things, lots of them are also seemingly innocent or harmless.

I wish people understood that I‚Äôm not traumatized by something ‚Äúsilly‚Äù; rather, that thing is somehow a reminder of a much much uglier part.

Just because something is a trigger, doesn‚Äôt mean that particular thing gave me PTSD. I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúsnowflake‚Äù that got traumatized by something so trivial, ANYTHING can be a trigger. A word, a smell, a picture, a concept, literally anything. Even a puppy can be a trigger. A trigger doesn‚Äôt have to be something blatantly ugly. 

It seems like people confuse the trauma with the things that trigger it, such as flashbacks and what not. They‚Äôre nowhere near the same thing. If someone drops a pen, and they have a full blown episode over it, it doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre literally afraid of dropping pens. It‚Äôs just a reminder of something much much more sinister that happened to them.

7,I'm a man who was raped by a woman,"I understand most people don't take this seriously. The first and only time I have ever told anyone else outside of writing it here, I was told ""So, you got laid. Coolio. Good for you! There's no way you didn't like it. She's hot, man, how was it?!"" Had I been a young female, I think my friend's reaction and people's reaction would be different. But because I'm a man, I like sex, apparently.

Anyway, I was in college and starting to deal with my childhood traumas. I opened up to a woman not much older than me for the first time about that stuff. We were in class and tasked with writing a personal story and share it with our partner for feedback with regards to the style of poetry we were told to use. The first red flag should have been when she asked ""Are you **sure** you were abused as a kid?"" When I defended myself gently, she apologized very much and so forth. During our break, we got a coffee and she leaned in to kiss me. I leaned back and apologized, saying that I wasn't comfortable with being intimate with anyone that I wasn't at least a year or more into a relationship, and how I was also the type to save sex for marriage."" ""Sure you are."" She said smiling. She forced herself on me, kissing me, and I caved. Anxiety. Fear, my body saying yes while my mind was trying to escape in fear.

Long story short, we had a back-and-forth love/hate relationship and I was too spineless and weak to break out a partnership in class off. She needed my help with something one night at her house, and she paid me for it. All good. But then she pushed me on the sofa, took our clothes off... and I'll leave the rest up to your imagination. I felt broken, nearly crying in front of her, but then played it off as anxiety and anger, scurrying out of her home, barely putting my clothes back on before exiting the door. 'Was that good for you too, baby?"" She said when she saw me leaving. When I'd tried to fight her off initially, she was like ""I always control the situation. Why would you fight me? Just let it happen, let me ride you, you might like it since you're a virgin, I promise you'll be safe. Learn from your past punishment.""

I'm pretty logical. I haven't done therapy for this, but previous traumas and never found therapy helpful. But this just gets to me because since I am naturally attracted to women, I have this poor defense when I'm near one because I know that I probably wouldn't be strong enough to fight one off of that happened. When a man did the same, I was able to try at least, to fight it off because there was no level of attraction. Yes, I orgasmed in her and that's what breaks me. I made a vow to save sex for marriage and she forced it out of me. Maybe I shouldn't say forced, since I wasn't strong enough to stop her. If I had... anyway. It's been years since this happened and I feel more ashamed about the girl-raping-guy part than the guy on guy part.

Not sure what my intention here was, I suppose just to vent and see if anyone has relating feelings or experiences.",jgsh1v,235,0.98,54,2020-10-23 18:11:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/jgsh1v/im_a_man_who_was_raped_by_a_woman/,False,False,2020,10
8,"""My trauma is worse than yours""","These are words I hope no one ever hears or says to anyone else. It's extremely belittling and ignorant to say this to someone else. Unfortunately, these are the words I heard from my mom last night. 

Honestly, I know she went through more than I did. And I constantly tell myself that what I went through wasn't ""that bad"". But there's just some days where it really gets to me, and that's when she tells me to just ""get over it"". She wanted me to do my schoolwork, but I had a nightmare and it really messed me up for the day. But instead of offering support to me, she said, ""A nightmare? You couldn't do schoolwork for a whole day because of a nightmare? You want to talk about trauma? Mine was worse than yours.""

So that wasn't fun. My nightmares are occurring much more frequently atm because it's almost the trauma anniversary, and my mom doesn't seem to care or want to help, even though we went through one of the traumas together. It sucks.

9,"Does anyone else get dreams that isn't about their traumatic event, but have themes of it?","TW sexual abuse/ assault description 

If anyone wants more info into what happened to me, you can check my profile.

I've had quite weird and scary dreams these past two nights. The first one was where I was alone with a man in a car, he resembled my abuser body shape wise. I was in a parking lot and the man was in the front seat and I in the back. He got out and walked to where I was, I immediately began to panic even though he didn't enter the car. I was thinking that something bad will happen, he entered the car and I scooted away from him, the dream gets blurry from here but I vividly remember that feeling of extreme fear and helplessness while he was hugging me or having his arm around my waist. (I'm scared of hugs because of what happened to me, I guess that might be connected but I don't know) I was just feeling so so terrified, and I felt that exact same blood curdling fear when the traumatic event was happening. I felt completely frozen both in the dream and the original event. 

Then I was outside a police station and that's where it ended. (I never reported) 

The second one is a lot more obscure and confusing, it was like any ordinary weird dream, I was driving somewhere, it felt as if I was in a video game, but then I was again at a police station. I was inside of the building and then I hear a 17 year old girl scream, 'get off me, get the fuck off me. I'm 17. Stop it, stop it.'

I began to feel fearful and I froze again, but I got the courage to turn the corner and I caught a small glimps of an older man cuddling this girl, I'm assuming it was tight since she couldn't get away. She started to scream something about her boyfriend but her voice didn't sound like it was a little whimper, it was screams of anger, frustration and being fed up. But the man wouldn't let her go.

Then a woman police officer was way too calmly walking down the hallway this was happening, it looked like she won't do anything about the situation because of the way she walked but I woke up straight after seeing that officer so I don't know if she would've done something or not. 

I'm just in a weird place right now. I've been having dreams of sexual assaults/ abuse, even rape (I was never raped) ever since the traumatic event happened. I never had dreams like that before, never. 

Can anyone relate to my situation and is this normal??

21,Can you have PTSD and still be largely functional?,"I am functional; workout regularly, do my best at work, and I am able to keep up with part-time studies. I get stuff done for my new home and for any other matters in my life. I also lead a small community of women needing support. And meet up with friends regularly. The only difference now is that I stopped partaking in musical instruments as I used to because I don‚Äôt have that motivation anymore. And because I am  functioning ‚Äúwell‚Äù, I don‚Äôt know if PTSD is what I have. I don‚Äôt sleep well, have vivid or recurring nightmares/flashbacks. I feel a lot of fear and anxiety.

24,I cannot stand to be touched,"Does any of you experience being touched the slightest as a trigger?

I've had these periods of extreme discomfort when people touch me for many years. I've all along tried to adapt to the culture of hugging and other kinds of friendly touch like someone taking my hand or putting their hands on my shoulder.
My husband is the only one who can still touch me without me wanting to scream because my nervous system reacts so violently to this.

How is your experience with this trigger?
How did you overcome.
I'm starting to tell people close to me to keep a distance to my personal space and NOT touch me the slightest. I just need a break from trying to adjust to this culture.

But do I need to, at any time in the future, to accept that people need hugs and so on?

EDIT:
Thanks to all who shared your experience on this. It's of course terrible to read that we struggle with such a basic thing.
Your ways to handle the trigger inspires me, not only to do something about it, but accept along the way that I don't owe anyone hugs etc. It's a big deal to come to this conclusion for me.

27,Feeling inferior because my traumas have affected my success,"I am almost 30 years old and I don't have much to show for it. I can't drive (I have a beginners license but no car), I am not married, I don't have kids, I don't own a house, I don't have a career, I haven't completed college (drop out), I don't have a significant other, and it's difficult for me to keep friends. I am frequently door slamming or ghosting people who get close to me because eventually they can trigger me and it makes me question my entire relationship with them.

I was in foster care and I have multiple sexual traumas throughout my entire life. None of these traumas have much closure, they just... are. They are just there, like the rape in my past that got reported and the police never made an arrest due to lack of evidence. He also raped a teenage girl who also reported years later, just like me, and neither of us got justice. I watch news stories about R Kelly, Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Cosby and it makes perfect sense to me that the women come out with their truth 20 years after the fact. It makes sense to me because I know that when it's a ""he said, she said"" it's not as credible as ""he said, THEY said"". It breaks my heart everytime some ignorant person in the comment section of some article asks why the women ""waited"" so long to come forward. 

I keep wondering if justice will ever even come for my rapist. My life has been put on hold waiting for justice to happen. It's as if I can't really cope with a reality where there is no justice for rape. Without any justice I just feel hypervigilant. 

When I know that:
1. only a very low % of rapists actually go to prison
2. the MAJORITY of rapists are known to their victims and have some kind of relationship with them (for example: an abusive partner, an ex, a friend, a neighbour, a coworker, etc) 
3. rapists can have cognitive dissonance and not consider themselves to be rapists even though they admit to doing sexuel acts that meet the definition of rape. So rapists can actually advertise themselves as feminists or activists and they can genuinely believe their own shit. 
4. Rapists can even be victims of sexual violence themselves (like my rapist). My rapist asked me once if I was ever raped before. I told him no and then he told me he had been raped when he was a child by a woman. Later in our relationship he ended up raping me because I triggered him and he wanted to punish me. He violently assaulted me and then he posted it on social media to humiliate me. Then later he told his guy friends that he ""made up"" being raped as a child. He told his friends he lies to women about being raped in order to get ""sympathy sex"" from girls. 

So I'll never really know his motives for attacking me? I don't know if he was really raped as a kid and sexually abused me due to untreated trauma... or if he was a psychopath who just lied about being traumatized because he just wants to abuse others? 

.... 

I moved to a new city to try to start over in life. When I knew that going to the police has a low probability of sending him to prison, I just wanted to be in a new city away from him because once I ran into him at a corner store in my hometown. It was so frightening. My world felt so small. 


So I moved to a new city and I thought I actually could just ""start over"". It looked so easy in my mind. I just imagined I could get a job, get a boyfriend, get married, have a family. It would be like nothing ever happened? 

I didn't even worry about ""processing my primary trauma"". I also didn't anticipate receiving secondary or tertiary traumas. I thought I just had to keep staying positive and things would be okay. But it's like I attract abusive men or something? 

When my police report didn't result in an arrest for my rapist, I was emotionally distraught but it wasn't an outcome I was surprised by. I well prepared for the expectation that the justice system is not adequately prepared to deliver justice to rape victims. I knew that when I reported. I read all about it when I was debating reporting. The thing that convinced me to report was when I found out he also assaulted a 15 year old girl, who also reported when she was an adult and her case didn't result in an arrest or court either (lack of evidence, just like me). The police officers told me that reporting could help build a criminal profile on him and could help ""the next girl"". So I reported, but it was devastating to my mental health. 

Before you report, there is this comfort in not reporting. As if you still have the ""option"" if you so chose to when ""the time is right"". It seems like a last resort sort of thing and in your mind you can fantasize that a report would result in some kind of legal response. In your daydream the cops take care of the bad guy. But in reality it's harsh. It's not like that. The police ask you what you were wearing, they ask you how it could be rape in his eyes if you didn't say ""no"" or physically fight back. You feel blamed and invalidated and that's it. That's the extent they do for you. They investigate your case for a short while, for me it was like a month or two of pure suspense. Then I got a call back saying there isn't enough evidence to go to court. 

..... 

Since then I've tried to ""move on"" and I am losing my mind? 

I tried to have sex. I wanted to have sex ""like everybody else"". Everyone else seemed to be into hookup culture except for me and I thought it was because my trauma was holding me back - preventing me from having fun like everyone else. I just wanted to have sex with some guy. I needed to prove to myself that not all guys are rapists, abusers, predators, etc. I can say ""not all men are rapists"". I can say that phrase but it means nothing if that doesn't reflect my life experiences. So I wanted to have lots of proof that this statement was true? So yeah I tried very hard to be hypersexual... and it didn't go very well. 

The first guy I met off an app like tinder was a guy who ended up telling me in person that his ""crazy ex"" accused him of rape and it went to court and he almost got ten years in prison. Well I knew from MY experiences with reporting rape that if it went to court, they had some evidence on him. So I was terrified that I met up with what I considered a rapist that also avoided prison (just like my rapist did). 

.... 

After that I was being sexually harassed at work. I made the mistake of telling my male coworker about the traumatic things happening in my life and he thought it was hilarious. He called me sexy and said I advertised my body with the skinny jeans and long sleeve form fitting shirts I wear. He tried to encourage another male coworker to touch my ass? The other guy didn't want to and was trying to tell him to stop then the guy tried to touch my ass himself and I freaked out and told my boss. My boss fired me and not him. My boss laughed when I cried. I had no proof it happened. I also figured that even if it was illegal for him to fire me over this, it doesn't matter because if they wouldn't give me justice for rape why would I get justice for something less traumatizing/severe? 

.... 
I tried to get a ptsd diagnosis. I thought I needed some time off to process everything that was happening. I was depressed and constantly crying. I drank a lot. I showered too much. My roommates complained that I was showering too much. The hot water started to peel the paint off the ceiling, that's how often I used the shower to cope. I was dissociation a lot and losing time. When I got a psychological evaluation the psychiatrist did not diagnose me with ptsd they instead diagnosed me with anxiety and depression and I was given a prescription for antidepressants/SSRIs. When I cried because they didn't diagnose me with ptsd. It felt so invalidating, like they were saying rape isn't traumatic... and I was asking for so little. I didn't even get legal justice, the least they could do is just acknowledge my emotional pain. The Dr asked me ""why do you care? The prescription is the same anyways""

.... 

Then I got a job at a coffee shop. It was located near a courthouse. I had cops as customers daily. Seeing them reminded me of my rape report. It made me so sad. I was told by my doctor that the antidepressants they put me on take a few months to become effective. Then my boss fired me. He told me it was because I looked ""too depressed"". I told him I literally had a clinical depression diagnosis (and it's illegal to fire someone over that) he said sorry but continued to fire me anyways. 
I never pursued legal action bc at that point I just figured nobody would care. 
.... 


Then I got a job at a Macdonald's. I have two seperate traumas here. One of my coworkers from this mcdonald's gave me his contact info after quitting. I initially liked him but I had this weird feeling about him? I thought he was funny, charming and smart... but he made my stomach hurt and I didn't really know why? I thought maybe I was just nervous because I had a crush on him? I figured that it also may be anxiety from my trauma. I tried to give him a chance because I thought it would be healing for me to either make a guy friend... or if something romantic developed. 

Well when I hung out with him he told me his ex was raped by 3 different guys and started laughing about it. Then he wanted to know if I had any trauma, and I told him I did and he wanted to know every detail. I was very uncomfortable and I didn't want to tell him about my rape but he kept pressuring me and pressuring me to tell him. He acted like it was a fun game and said things like ""pretty please"". He eventually gave up but then he tried to pressure me to take molly. He lied about what molly was. I asked him ""isn't that similar to ecstasy?"" and he said it wasn't but I googled it and molly is actually a more potent form of ecstasy. He joked about putting the molly in my drink when I was googling. I didn't know if he actually did it or not. I threw out my drink. He continued to joke about rape several times and said a lot of disturbing things about rape. He started to defend male celebrities accused of sexual abuse for instance. And he also said things like men are biologically wired to rape and that men ""love the chase"" and then he used his ex girlfriend as an example. He said initially she rejected him and he pursued her until ""he won"" (this is the same ex who was sexually abused by multiple men). 

That guy really fucked with my head and I could have an entire separate thread on my relationship with him and the manipulative person he is. But ultimately that was another situation for me where a guy is explicitly sexually abusive yet when I tried to reach out and tell people, people dismissed and minimized my concerns. Several people took his side knowing what he did. My own best friend broke off contact with me to remain friends with him. 

It's the most potent recent trauma I've had. My best friend, the one who sided with him also told me she had a history of sexual abuse just like me. She was a person I could go to if I needed to talk about sexual trauma and she ""got it"". What really made no sense to me was her betrayal. She had told me she has ptsd from rape and it affected her a lot like she doesn't even know if she's a lesbian or if she is just traumatized due to rape. She told me her mom didn't believe her when she told her that the mom's bf raped her. She would share with me examples of people in her life not understanding her ptsd and enabling abusive men who sexually harassed her. 

So it was shocking to me that she knew how painful it was to have loved ones support a sexual predator but then she went out of her way to defend a guy who was being sexually abusive towards me. 

.... 

Then my boss....
So my boss at the Mcdonalds I worked at started hitting on me. It was really awkward. I couldn't tell if he was joking or not at the beginning. I knew he was married so it was just awkward because he would ask me questions like if I found him attractive or if I would go on a date with him and I would be like ""uhhh aren't you married?"" and he replied laughing and saying ""a little bit"". But then he started touching me. He would pretend to offer me a high five but then squeeze my hands and manipulate my body into a hug. He would hold my hands? He kept asking me on dates... over and over again. And he kept offering me rides home (which I declined because I lived in walking distance from work).

I remembered the time I got fired for reporting sexual harassment so this time I decided I would record my boss harassing me so I at least have proof. So when he started asking me on a date when we were alone in the staff room when I was on break - I recorded it on my phone.

I showed a manager I trusted the video and she showed his boss and she had a meeting with me. She told me she watched the video and she was angry at his behaviour. She said they ""just had"" a meeting on sexual harassment in the workplace and that he should ""know better"" and that he's also married! So it was so shocking to her. She is also friends with him and the wife outside of work. She said the wife would be devestated if she knew and they could even get divorced. She said she wasn't going to fire him because of how it would ruin her friends marriage. She also told me that he isn't a citizen, he's here on a work visa or something so if he loses his job, he loses his citizenship or whatever it is and could get kicked out of the country? And she tried to make me agree with her decision? As if it was like ""so you see we can't punish him because it would mean he would have consequences to his actions""? It was infuriating.

She tried to make a deal with me where I could keep my job, he could keep his job and they just wouldn't schedule us together? But she lied and one day I came into work and he was there. She told me she didn't tell me he would be there because multiple people called in sick and they were severely under staffed. She said if she told me he would be there I wouldn't have shown up to work. I was so angry I walked off my shift.

Then I never felt safe returning to that place for work. The situation ended up escalating to her boss and her final solution was to just transfer me to a different mcdonald's location.

.... 

So that's what has been going on in my life. I've left out some other significant traumas. Like foster care and... biological family traumas.

But ultimately I don't even know what to do with myself anymore? I feel so stupid moving to this city and thinking it could be any different than my home town? As if it would be less traumatic for me to live here, as if traumas stop occurring to you if you only start over in a new city?

I don't know how to process a lifetime of traumas? It's one thing entirely to process the trauma of my rape. It's one thing to process that one event or the psyche of one abusive man's twisted thought process... but how am I supposed to deal with all of these things happening with no signs of it slowing or stopping?

I keep trying to get help and support. I have gotten a lot more comfortable talking about my trauma with others and actually asking for support... I think the #metoo movement helped with that... but it feels like society regression with my most recent trauma. The ex coworker who tried to spike my drink... a lot of the women who defended him were victims of sexual abuse themselves and some also claimed to be feminists as well? So now I'm just like... words don't even have meaning anymore. People have so much cognitive dissonance they can't really accept that their friend is a sexual predator.

One of his friends contacted me and started sending me malicious messages. She wanted me to get into legal trouble for ""ruining"" his image by telling people what he did. She acted like she was proud of herself for tricking me because initially she pretended that she just wanted to hear ""my side of the story"" before later revealing to me that she succeeded in gaining the ""evidence"" she was looking for (whatever that meant?). It was obvious from the beginning that she had a bias towards her friend.

So now I don't know. I feel so alone. I was betrayed by my friend who sided with the guy who tried to spike my drink. My friend did this to me knowing I was raped in the past and have ptsd as a result. All these people are defending him and I don't really have anyone defending me? Nobody is protecting me, in fact... the more vocal and outspoken I am about the injustice of rape/sexual violence/abuse/harassment and it's mental toll on the survivor... the more abusive men I seem to attract? They say they are just trolls or immature or stupid... but regardless..
what do you even do in my shoes?

I am so unsatisfied with my life right now. I might even say I feel entitled to some success or some peace in my life but the fact that I'm a loser and unsuccessful in EVERY aspect of my life from my career to my social life leaves me wondering why I'm even here and what my ultimate purpose is?

0,Annoying trend: Casual use of the term ptsd/triggered in pop culture,"Not to be that overly offended person, but I feel like I've heard a lot of flippant use of the term PTSD lately. Eg: omg that tik tok was so stupid it gave me PTSD, they changed the formula in my favourite lipstick - now I have PTSD, ugh minions are so annoying they gave me PTSD. 

It just rubs me up the wrong way to hear it used as a joke to replace 'annoyed' or 'shocked' or 'having a tantrum'. 

Don't even get me started on the ""hashtagtriggeredüòã"" stuff.  Like: Oh my god, I hate that girl, I'm so triggered right now #triggeredlol. (I don't mean legit use of triggered, I mean I've seen stupid uses that I feel devalue the actual term and make me hesitant to even use it properly cos I feel stupid saying it.)

Like, occasionally I'll use it meta/ironically in a self deprecating way, to let my partner know I actually am being triggered but don't want to get too emotional about it. I get that being sincere about trauma is hard. But in general, it's just a joke to so many people these days. It grinds my gears üò©


I'm not sure if anyone gets what I mean, but I feel it makes it harder to talk about and even take myself seriously when I'm trying to hard to work through trauma.

3,Does Anyone Else feel shame for not being able to work because of their trauma?,"Hello 

So I have PTSD and it can be so debilitating sometimes that I am in and out of bed all day. I dissociate daily and feel anxious constantly. I'm a full-time college student and it can be so hard to focus on the simplest assignments or even taking notes in class. I'm in therapy and taking SSRIs and Buspar for anxiety.

I come from a very ""just get over it"", ""put yourself up and move on"", ""stop being so sensitive"" sort of family. My mom essentially forced me to not accept all of my aid money for school so she could financially support me with my groceries. Other than the fact that she barely gives me enough to live off of, she also expects me to get a job.

Don't get me wrong. I really really want to work and be independent, but I feel like dealing with the symptoms of my trauma is a job in and of itself. How can I possibly work when I can hardly keep myself from dissociating and I can have a flashback at any moment? I feel so much shame because I feel like I should be able to work just like everyone else and function just like anyone else.

Does anyone else feel this way? How do you cope with this and stop feeling so much shame for how your brain responds to trauma?

If this is the trade-off I have to have, the thing I have to deal with... that's fine. It's worth it. I wouldn't trade being me for anything else.

8,A spiritual leader just shamed me after I set a boundary saying I did not feel comfortable discussing my childhood sexual abuse! Wtf!,"A spiritual leader just shamed me after I set a boundary saying I did not feel comfortable discussing my childhood sexual abuse! Wtf!

So I did a virtual appointment with two spiritual people who guide plant medicine spiritual sessions for healing. My main purpose was to ask them more about how they could help me and the different types of Spiritual ceremonies they hold. I spent over one hundred dollars to get more information about them and they barely answered my questions.

First, they ask me about why I am looking to work with the medicine. I tell them childhood sexual, racial and mental trauma. Then I tell them how I am looking for safe spaces because unfortunately I've been getting preyed on by predators in these spaces. He asks for more details about the predator experience and asks if the predator flirted with me. I briefly summarize what happened then change the subject by discussing some of the positives of the past spiritual events I went to. Then he keeps asking me for more details about the trauma and my intentions, but I continue to give vague answers because This spiritual healing work is pretty personal, independent and you actually don't need to tell your guides the specifics of your trauma. He kept pushing and I tell them I don't feel comfortable sharing my childhood sexual abuse especially because I just met them and this work is personal and knowing the details of my trauma is not necessary. I ask them what is their purpose of wanting to know? They say ""it will help him figure out what intentions I should set and what ceremonies are best for me."" He continues pushing and asks if I have a therapist? I tell him that I've been in therapy for years and also have a degree in psychology/counseling.

Then he says we are just souls that pick up stories (trauma).. So then why was he so persistent of hearing about my trauma when he is saying it doesn't matter so much?! 

 They wasted my time, it was obvious they hadn't read the form I was told to complete beforehand for them because he said ""next time you will have to fill out the form and we will discuss what ceremonies are best for you."" I told them ""I already filled out the form and did they read it?"" Then the female leader was like oh yes. Obviously they didn't otherwise they wouldn't have been asking questions that  were already answered on there. Then he kept filling up the time with random psychological information (and he is not a trauma trained individual) about our brain being stuck in child trauma.. it's like they were just trying to fill up time because they were unprepared. Then he tries to tell me I am not allergic to mushrooms and it is just anxiety. He was acting like he was all knowing and knew what was best for me and he had just met me! 

He told me to stop being logical and get in touch with my intuition. When I told them I would want to do the healing work in women spaces due to my trauma, he said he couldn't change himself into a woman.. so basically Id be stuck with him as a guide.

Then he tells me I need to work on surrendering because I am hyperprotective. I told him I did struggle with surrendering and he asked why. I said it was hard to give up control because of past trauma. He said control is all a perception and I needed to surrender.

He tells me predators I've been harassed by recently have been attracted to my energy due to my struggle of surrendering. He says ""everyone has childhood trauma and you shouldn't come to just take.. When you come to group meetings, you need to open up and give and take.. you should come with a nonjudgmental ear."" He tells me he doesn't think I am ready for a spiritual ceremony soon and that I need to do gentle things like yoga and find small ways to surrender. He says next time I come I have to be willing to share everything about me. WTH!!! So I am being ""judgemental and just taking"" because I set boundaries and don't want to unnecessarily share my childhood trauma to strangers?! Notice how they are using ""surrender"" to push boundaries?!

How disappointing that he tried to shift the blame on me when they were the ones who were unprepared and prying personal information by pushing boundaries! I feel mad and triggered. He shamed me for setting and sticking with my boundary. I also feel proud because I've come so far that I set and stick to my boundaries. The fact that someone is telling me I need to open up tells me I've progressed because I used to be called an open book! Not everyone gets the privilege of knowing my trauma...that may come once trust is established.

ugh!! Validation and support would be nice, thank you.",jyosvj,175,0.97,72,2020-11-22 03:36:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/jyosvj/a_spiritual_leader_just_shamed_me_after_i_set_a/,False,False,2020,11
9,I let my mom have it today and it felt fucking awesome!,"So, last time I was supposed to do EMDR therapy I told my therapist I didn‚Äôt want to because the previous session had made me very angry with my mom. Well, my therapist absolutely laid into my mom, I‚Äôve never heard someone say those things about her before but they are so damn true. She also said that out of all of her patients who have troubles with their mother MINE IS THE WORST!!

She said I grew up with a narcissistic mother and was a victim of serious neglect. Not really knowing the depth of either of those I did some digging and yeah, emotional and physical neglect and for sure narcissistic mother. My therapist also told me that my mother has never offered me a true apology for what happened and owned her misdeeds.

I called her this morning and laid everything my therapist said out, gave her all of the clinical examples of physical and emotional neglect and told her the markers of a narcissistic parent. She said I don‚Äôt know how many times I can say sorry. I asked her if she could own up to any of the abuse she inflicted on me and she absolutely denied everything and I told her until she owns up to it we are done talking and hung up.

That means no contact with her only grandchild.

1,I feel ashamed for having PTSD when other people have much more traumatic and understandable causes than mine,"I know veterans aren‚Äôt the only ones who have PTSD, and I know there are plenty of veterans who probably also feel weak or ashamed or embarrassed for having PTSD. I‚Äôm not a veteran, and I can‚Äôt stop feeling like my reason for having PTSD isn‚Äôt good enough or isn‚Äôt as bad as other people‚Äôs, especially veterans‚Äô. 

I went through almost a year in a relationship filled with emotional and sexual abuse, and now almost half a year of the reporting process with my college that has honestly ended in disaster, with the conduct board blaming me instead of my abuser. I know what I went through was traumatic, I know that PTSD is what I‚Äôm struggling with now, but I feel so weak and ashamed for it. I don‚Äôt mean for this to seem insensitive to anyone, but for some reason I can‚Äôt stop thinking that at least veterans with PTSD (or others who got PTSD from service to others or their country) got it while doing something brave and noble, while I got it from just letting another person have power over me and letting that person make me afraid. 

If I had just been more assertive, maybe he would have stopped. I could have just left ‚Äî I know now all of his implied threats were empty anyways ‚Äî he never would have hurt himself, he was just saying that. 

I only let this happen to protect myself. I have no noble reason for it. I was selfish and dumb and naive, and it really is my fault for letting this happen. There are plenty of people, like veterans and firefighters and EMTs and police officers and doctors and nurses who have PTSD as a result of serving their country and their community, not from being too weak to stand up for themselves like I was. 

On the one hand, I really believe this, that it‚Äôs my fault, that I should have said something, and that other people who have PTSD are so much more worthy of support and admiration because they‚Äôve been through so much more difficult things for better, more noble reasons than me. But on the other hand, I rationally know that that‚Äôs not how this works, or at least I hope it‚Äôs not.

5,Who else here has problems with concentration and memory,"Where to start?

I want to start my story with the problem. 5 years ago I had a child. She had stomach problems so she kept me up for hours at night. That's hard obviously. I was exhausted. I've always had problems with concentration and memory. But after I had my first baby... I felt I was losing my mind. I could not do the simplest task like grocery shopping, let alone my job. most importantly I failed my child as a mother. I also had a lot and physical pain, after being misdiagnosed with fibromyalgia I did fasiatherapie. Which did wonders! Really. I am almost pain free. But I still felt like I was losing my mind.

I went to a special unit consisting of doctors but also a psychologist. They found  nothing physical wrong with me, the psychologist diagnosed me with PTSD.

I wanted to get better so badly, for my child. I 'confused' to my biggest secret, even though I did not really want to talk about it. I was molested for years by my grandfather. I don't remember when it started,  my first memories I think I was 5 but i think it was going on longer then that. It stopped when I was 11 and he died when I was 12.

I remember flashes, my memory of my trauma is fragmented. The psychologist said all of my concentration and memory problems are a result of repressing memories for almost 2 decades. She said, the only way to get better is to talk about it with the help of EMDR. 

I really tried but my mind resists to the point of fainting. I was pregnant at the time and the psychologist opted not to push me. But the therapy seemed pointless to both of us after a few sessions.

I don't know what to do now. I work part-time out of necessity. If I get to tired, I can't remember anything and I can't concentrate on anything.

I just had covid and am extremely tired, even working part time. My colleagues don't know about my mental health, I don't feel safe talking to them. They just keep saying to 'think positive'. When I mention PTSD they laugh and say that's what soldiers have, so I just drop it. My husband does support me. He's an angel. He is so patience, i'm so grateful.

I feel stuck. I don't want to remember. I really, really don't want to remember more then I already do.

Is there really no other way, no other therapy to get better? To improve my concentration?",kagx4i,166,0.99,41,2020-12-10 15:10:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/kagx4i/who_else_here_has_problems_with_concentration_and/,False,False,2020,12

7,Family makes fun of my triggers,"I grew up with an alcoholic and drug addicted father. He was never physically abusive towards me but I've had a lot of traumatic experiences of him high out of his mind,  driving drunk,  having a psychotic episode,  slamming things,  etc.

One of my triggers is when my family is heavily under the influence. If they're just tipsy it's fine but if they start acting delirious then I get really anxious. Anyway, last year my mom decided she wanted to try an edible (weed). My brother told her to eat a whole cookie. I was begging her to only take a piece of it (300mg cookie!!).

Anyways she took it and my brother went off to a party so I was home alone with my mom, who of course got insanely high. She was basically stoned on the couch speaking nonsense to herself and her mouth was so dry, her eyes were so red etc. In a certain way this image is funny, and that's how my mom and my brother see it.

10,Anyone else not able to work Anymore? PTSD/Anxiety Disorder,"I've been struggling with this almost 4 years now and finally applied for social security a week ago. I got fired from my last three jobs for attendance. I haven't worked in a year and struggle to even make a trip through Walmart. I don't even enjoy my only hobby anymore (Gaming) because anxiety always ruins it. It exhausts me even to the point that I have thrown up trying to force my self to keep playing and ignore it. Aside from that my anxiety is constant, usually worse at night and panic attacks are pretty much every other day. I'm not a war hero and my illness is from several traumatic events but I feel like my symptoms aren't normal for just PTSD.

12,How do I (30m) support and live together with my gf (26f) with complex PTSD without burning myself out?,"My girlfriend of 1 year has severe complex PTSD and mild dissociative disorder (DID) symptoms. She also had cancer as a kid, and now has rather severe energy issues and some other weird after-effects. She's lovely and she let me know right from the start, so I knew what I was stepping into. Things went quite well and we managed greatly, and she's even doing quite a bit better. However, things took a decline after we decided to move into a new house together.

So her PTSD originates from long-term abuse by a malicious partner when she was young. We're still not sure what exactly it is that he did, but brainwashing puts it pretty close. Currently it manifests in twitching and full-on panic attacks at temperature changes, loud noises, jump-scares, feelings of abandonment and lack of daily structures. When it's really bad, DID pops up and I get to see some of her alts (which isn't really that bad, it's quite fun, but it wears her out and I also cannot do anything else than be there with her at that time). Sex is a different cookie altogether, and it's basically only enjoyable for her if I take a completely dominant role. For me this is still pleasurable, but also exhausting, so I never actually relax during sex, so on top of these problems is that she wants it more than me and me not wanting it as much plays 100% into her abandonment anxiety / 'not being sexy' anxiety.

As a partner I'm now struggling and at the brink of burning out myself because I'm too busy with keeping her ticking over while at the same time also running the household since she can't really do *as* much due to her energy issues. We have had a BDSM power-exchange dynamic going on for a while, though this takes a lot of time and effort and it has gotten to a point where I don't necessarily feel the freedom to go do stuff just for myself anymore, since I feel that without guidance she will simply not do anything because of her anxiety - it makes me feel guilty for taking time for myself, even though she specifically tells me that I should first and foremost take care of myself. Again, she is lovely.

We both don't have a job and that's not going to change anytime soon, and I find my days filled with stress of figuring out how I can get her needs met (I am/was a very laid-back and ""oh we'll see and maybe we do nothing thats also fine"" person, borderline lazy), and I can't seem to meet my own without feeling guilty about 'dropping' her. I also can't see myself doing this forever, which is problematic. 

We now have almost daily heavy talks that are burning us both out, about things that are bothering us, how she lacks structure, how I'm perceived lazy, how the lack of sex and BDSM play is affecting her (or rather, the not knowing when the next time we'll play will be), while I don't really want to a-priori plan those things. The result is that she crashes and burns on the lack of those before I felt like I wanted to do them out of my own motivation/urge/will, and after that happens the next time we do something then by definition feels like a 'fix for her PTSD', a must-do chore. This plays into her anxiety that I'm just doing it for her and don't actually like it myself, and I never get to prove that I do like it myself but just not that often. We can't seem to get out of that cycle. 

Also at this point my libido has hit a low due to the stress, so there's a nice feedback loop going on.

I was hoping to get some advice here on how you guys deal with partners with PTSD, especially the cases that require a decent amount of caregiving from the partners side. How do you deal with meeting their needs, but also upholding your own? And how do you deal with it if upholding your own means their needs are not met?

Are there any resources someone could point me to that help partners of someone with PTSD?

0,"I suddenly understand what that whole ""being relaxed"" thing everyone always talks about is like. It's astonishing what therapy can do when done right.","After years and years of holding on to various traumas that manifested themselves in a wide variety of symptoms, ranging from excruciating nightmares and panic attacks to hallucinations and psychosomatic heartache, I finally went through an intense process of treatment. I was so skeptical before and during the process(And damn, it was hard), but suddenly, something clicked: I could look back at myself in those memories and feel sad for that girl instead of living in those memories as if they were constantly surrounding me.   
I experienced an intense release of emotion(for quite a while, bless my flatmate's hearts for dealing with me) and my body finally stopped tensing up like it constantly would. I stopped feeling the urge to drink every day. I got my period for the first time in 4 years. I find myself sitting in my room feeling abnormal about finally feeling normal. It's insane.

I know I'm not fully healed, I still get intrusive thoughts, still have nightmares, and still get anxiety attacks among other symptoms. It's a work in progress. I still need to get back on the job market and know that once the lockdowns are over, I might be confronted with certain things again that might require more help. However, I found solace in the knowledge that things truly can get better. If you're reading this and feeling low: I wish you all the best and am hopeful that you will feel better. No feeling lasts forever. :)

7,Mother trying to move on after finding out 12 year out daughter was raped,"Edit: WARNING. This horror has become so apart of my life now that I‚Äôm use to it. And I forget that it really fucks people up just hearing about it it‚Äôs so traumatic. So just to prepare it‚Äôs about aggravated sexual assault with young children.


Ok so I found out this summer that my daughter who is 12 now was raped when she was 7 multiple times by my best friends husband. She told me that it finally stopped when she went to her best friend, (my best friends daughter) and asked her to tell her dad to stop. And then it didn‚Äôt happen again after that. I called my best friend and told her what I just found out. She was shocked and had doubts but said she would ask her daughter if she remembers that. She called me back an hour later crying cuz her daughter admitted and admitted he‚Äôs been raping her too starting when she was 5. His own daughter. she kicked her husband out and we called the police and I‚Äôm very happy to say after a week of working with the fbi. my friend got him to confess to it all while the fbi was listening. He‚Äôs now in jail waiting trial. Finding this all out has devastated our whole family. My husband had to come home early from his deployment we were so devastated. Months have gone by. I signed My daughter up for trauma counseling and they said after two sessions she doesn‚Äôt need trauma counseling. That she has moved on from this and is not traumatized by it. I asked my daughter if that was true and she said yes she just wants to move on and be a normal family again. I tell her ok and say help is there for you if you need it. I know this is what she wants and she doesn‚Äôt want this to be our life. but I‚Äôm having a hard time moving on and I don‚Äôt want to upset her. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. It doesn‚Äôt make sense. How the fuck did I not see this.. how did my friend. not see this. Our family have been so close for the last ten years. We get together 3 times a week for ten years. He was so fucking normal. How did I not see this monster who raped his 3 biological daughters now we know, and my daughter was next to me this whole time. We are both stay at home moms. Our kids are our everything. And these kids were always happy. We never once saw them in pain or saw bloody underwear or saw her crying around him. And they had to have been and I can‚Äôt move on from my confusion. How was this massive absolute horror happening for years and no one had a clue. And the guilt. My job is to protect her and I failed. No matter what I do for the rest of her life I have failed as her mother. I don‚Äôt know how to not have this be my life. I‚Äôm never gonna not be devastated or confused or fulled with so much guilt. Everyone says I need therapy but I don‚Äôt see the point. On the outside I‚Äôm normal. I‚Äôm ok I‚Äôm not crying on the couch for days. I‚Äôm playing with my kids and my husband and I are great. We really leaned on each other. He agrees with my daughter and wants to move on. I feel like my family is moving forward and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. Lucky I have my best friend still. And she is the only one who understand what I‚Äôm going through. But it‚Äôs not the same. She understands that for about two years of my life all my photos are ruined. Every photo from the time she was 6-8 all I think about is was this when she was raped? Is she in pain in this photo and she pretending? My friend understands this because all the photos for the last 18 years are ruined for her. And she feels all this guilt and more. I can‚Äôt imagine what she is going though. She lost her husband who she thought they ‚Äúwe‚Äôre happy‚Äù but realizes it was all a lie. She lost her dream house(that she closed on three days before we found out)She lost 2/3 of her income. And she has the guilt of this happening to her three daughters. She knows what I‚Äôm going through more then anyone. But what I‚Äôm going through doesn‚Äôt even compare to what she‚Äôs going though. I don‚Äôt want to complain to her about my family going back to normal and happy and I‚Äôm just frozen with my thoughts. 

Ok so not I explained what I‚Äôm going though I was wondering if anyone has gone through something similar. And I‚Äôm wondering if me frozen with my horror in my head is just my normal and I need to except it.",kzg0s5,121,0.98,59,2021-01-17 21:57:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/kzg0s5/mother_trying_to_move_on_after_finding_out_12/,False,False,2021,1

9,You can't ignore PTSD.,"In our society, we tend to think that we are failures if life takes us off our planned path. But are we really failures? I‚Äôd like to make the argument that when life takes us off course, we can forge a new way forward.

When I was a firefighter, I pushed myself well beyond my mental abilities; thinking I could just shake off the traumatic events I witnessed and get back on the rig for the next call.

I suppose this myth I was telling my self worked for a while, or, so I had thought. Turns out, that I was not coping at all; I was, in fact, doing more and more damage.

Knowing your mental limits

When the time came that my mental strength was all but exhausted, I felt defeated; like I had failed. After all, none of my colleagues seem to be having this issue. On the day I resigned, I felt like a complete and utter failure. To add to this perceived failure, was this head to toe feeling of weakness and shame.

A DOUBLE WHAMMY

Who knew that pushing through my mental pain would be such a bad idea? I really wish I had known at the time; it may have saved the rest of my life from coming unravelled. However, my reality has been forged by the fact that I didn‚Äôt know.

Due to my decisions to keep fighting on with no regard for my mental health, I lost; my feelings of failure were compounded by the fact that I had recognized my illness too late. Perhaps its more accurate to say that I pushed it down and packed my trauma so tight that it finally snapped.

Whichever was the case, the mental pain my fire service days had leached into every facet of my life. This sad reality I faced would include my work life too.

Like what you are reading? Try¬†Path To Mental Healing.

Making my living as a health care worker was not an easy one to say the least. I had witnessed some pretty traumatic incidents there too. While this was my was also my reality, the cornerstone for my PTSD without question, stemmed from the fire service.

Regardless, I had mentally bled out for far too long and before I knew it, my mistaken resilience crumbled under the weight of my mental illness. Only a few short years after calling it quits as a volunteer firefighter, I would find myself making an exit from my workplace as well; proving that you can‚Äôt ignore PTSD, it will indeed, get you in the end.

IS FAILURE SUCH A BAD THING?

While I thought for years after I left the service that I had failed at everything I loved; I‚Äôm happy to say that I was wrong. Failure is just a conduit for success so long as you keep moving forward. Doing what I have to do, has been slowly leading me down the¬†road to mental wellness¬†and as a result, I have discovered new passions along the way.

When every aspect of my life went off the rails, I turned to writing in a desperate attempt to sort out what was going on inside my head. Consequently, a new passion was ignited; a love for writing.

You can‚Äôt ignore PTSD, this is true but if you are manning up, shoving it down or in just plain old denial, please know that when¬†PTSD¬†becomes too much, there is life after the military or emergency services. Failure is an option as long as you understand this: PTSD or any mental illness is not something you choose to have and secondly; as humans, we are gifted with the ability to discover other passions. So in that regard, no matter what we go through in life, we can always find something that gives us our love for life back.

1,people overuse ‚Äúptsd‚Äù and ‚Äútrauma‚Äù,"edit #2: i am going to preface this by saying PLEASE actually read my post before leaving a comment about how people shouldn‚Äôt decide what is and isn‚Äôt trauma. i do not support using trauma as a competition to see whose is worse, and it‚Äôs never okay to try and discredit other‚Äôs traumatic experiences. i am also 100% NOT saying that an incident is only traumatic if it fits ptsd criteria. this post was only meant to express my frustration with people who use the term ptsd to describe healthy, normal negative feelings, and people who like to make compilations of courage the cowardly dog and call it their ‚Äúchildhood trauma.‚Äù if you have any other issues with the post, i‚Äôve probably addressed it in a comment. i don‚Äôt want anyone to feel like their experiences are invalid because of what i wrote. so now that i‚Äôve cleared that up, here‚Äôs the original post:

it‚Äôs so exhausting to see people constantly claim to have ptsd and claim that every. negative. experience. they have had is ‚Äútrauma.‚Äù 

throughout my time on social media i have seen SO many people claim to have ptsd from a significant other cheating, losing a friend due to petty drama, etc. 

i am not trying to invalidate anyone by saying that these experiences aren‚Äôt hard and that they can‚Äôt be traumatic, and i have no problem with people asking about this to genuinely understand the disorder, but by definition in the DSM you do not qualify for a ptsd diagnosis unless you have been ‚Äúexposed to one or more event(s) that involved death or threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or threatened sexual violation,‚Äù by either you directly experiencing it, witnessing it occur to another person, learning of it happening to a close friend or relative, or being repeatedly exposed to details of a distressing event. 

i am so tired of opening up to people about my PTSD and hearing ‚Äúoh yeah i have ptsd too, my girlfriend left me for someone else.‚Äù like...really? 
do NOT compare me being raped, someone nearly getting killed, or witnessing an act of extreme violence to you having a bad break up. it‚Äôs fucking insensitive, minimizing, and plain disrespectful to everyone with a ptsd diagnosis. 

im sorry if this sounded harsh, but i am just so fed up and tired of this shit. it‚Äôs hurtful.

edit: i am not talking about people who actually have ptsd and choose to only share smaller events. i am also not saying it‚Äôs okay to compare traumas to see who‚Äôs is ‚Äúworse,‚Äù and i am not trying to tell people what is and isnt trauma. im just stating that recently people have been throwing the term ‚Äúptsd‚Äù around the same way they do adhd and ocd, and it‚Äôs actually really harmful.",lno9kv,327,0.93,179,2021-02-19 19:28:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/lno9kv/people_overuse_ptsd_and_trauma/,False,False,2021,2

Definitely one of the less severe factors of PTSD but it‚Äôs so embarrassing.

4,My grandmother is dying and I could not care less. Fuck her and that time she tried to kill me.,"I don‚Äôt even know where to begin.  My grandmother is the most toxic and vile person that I have ever come across.  Not only just in real life either, but even across movies and TV shows.  I can‚Äôt think of a more disgusting repulsive human being.  

My first ever memory from my childhood is of her beating the shit out of me.  I couldn‚Äôt have been more than 6 years old.  I was on the couch in the fetal position trying to cover my head whilst taking shots.  Then I blacked out.  

This is about par for the course for grandma.  In my family they say, ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs just grandma being grandma.  Just don‚Äôt think about it.‚Äù

I guess that‚Äôs just what you say when you‚Äôve spent a life time taking beatings from this fucking midget ogre.  I hear my mom and her sisters took beatings even worse than we did.  I still remember her losing her mind and beating the living pulp out of my brother and my cousin.  My grandpa had to tackle her and restrain her on numerous occasions.  Prying whatever object out of her hands that she decided would be the tool she would use to beat us with; Broom handle, wooden beating paddle, bare knuckles with rings, didn‚Äôt matter. 

It‚Äôs not like we were the worst kids in the entire fucking world either.  Like we deserved to be beaten that way.  All you had to do was look at her funny, or say something in the wrong tone, or disagree with her, or express your feelings, or just simply exist and be around her.  Didn‚Äôt matter.  If she wanted to dish out a beating, simply because she felt like it, well then you were going to catch a beating.  

For some reason, everybody in my family still supports and sympathizes with this tragic waste of human life.  I can only imagine this must be due to Stockholm syndrome.  I sure as hell don‚Äôt fucking understand it.  Fuck her.  

The first and only time that I (or anybody for that matter) ever tried to stand up to her I almost died.  She was calling my girlfriend a slut because she liked to wear thigh high skirts.  I told her so what, I like the way she dresses and that‚Äôs all that matters.  She told me her parents should be ashamed of her, I interrupted her and told her ‚Äúyeah but you‚Äôre not her parents,  she can do whatever she wants and she can wear whatever she wants.  You are not her mother.‚Äù  Grandma screams at me ‚ÄúEXCUSE ME!  DONT YOU EVER TALK TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER THAT WAY!  YOU LISTEN AND SHUT UP!‚Äù  To which I carelessly and recklessly replied ‚Äúfuck you, go fuck yourself.  Nobody cares what you think‚Äù

She grabbed the biggest knife out of the kitchen, at minimum a 12‚Äù kitchen utility knife, and trotted her fat ass right towards me.  Fire burning in her eyes.  I jumped out of my chair and threw it behind me in the hopes that it would get in her way and slow down her chase.  She stops at the other end of the kitchen table.  I‚Äôm at the opposite corner, trapped.  I instinctively grab the other chairs and pull them out, hopping I can use them some how to escape.  We play a game of cat and mouse.  Jab stepping both left and right to see who is going to make the first move.  The stupid bitch takes my bait and goes right to where I faked, I dip and go around the other way.  She lunges at me over the chairs and table, swiping at me with the giant fucking blade in her hand.  I narrowly escape.  I dip and bend my torso to avoid her savage attempts at murdering me.  I sprint down the hall to my room.  I try to shut the door but she‚Äôs right behind me trying to push it back open. I shove the door back into her and just barely get it to close behind me.  I lock the door handle whilst she kicks, punches, and stabs at the door.  All while screaming and screeching that she‚Äôs going to fucking kill me.  

I call the police.  They arrive moments later.  I‚Äôve already packed a bag of my necessities.  I just want to get the fuck out of dodge.  The cops escort me out as my my grandmother screams and yells to the cops to arrest me, to kick me out of her house.  I walk out quietly and tell the cops I just want to leave and go to my friends house.  They oblige.  

This woman, my grandma, this piece of shit Is the reason that I suffer from PTSD.  I don‚Äôt believe in a heaven or a hell, there is no reasoning or justice for the bull shit that she‚Äôs put me through, but I hope she spends eternity suffering a miserable existence.  I don‚Äôt care what or where that is, just make her as miserable as she‚Äôs made the rest of this world.  

Fuck you grandma you lousy piece of shit.  I don‚Äôt give two shits about your final days here on earth.  I hope it hurts, I hope you regret everything.  I will never forgive you.  You are not my family.  We may be related by blood, but you are not my family.  I get to choose the people in my family.

Be kind to yourself.

Here's an example of a study linking genetics and biochemistry (specifically of vitamin D) to the development of PTSD: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ItsAllInYourGenes/comments/ldnbne/posttraumatic\_stress\_disorder\_is\_associated\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ItsAllInYourGenes/comments/ldnbne/posttraumatic_stress_disorder_is_associated_with/)

7,"I'm about done with EMDR, and I've come to a realization with my PTSD.","I've had a hard life. Especially in my childhood. 

I know everyone has a different story. My story is a childhood of being told I was not good enough. Being told I was stupid. Then I was assaulted when I was still naive and did not understand the world yet.

EMDR showed me that my trauma was complex. In fact, so complex, it's almost incurable. I've made some progress- but when your childhood is a decade of being told you aren't good enough, being mentally abused, then physically by others- it's just, hard.

I'm never going to completely give up, but as a 30 year old man now, I know that I just have to make good with what I've  been given. I'll always have to carry a childhood of trauma around with me wherever I go. 

But EMDR has showed me that I can somewhat deal with the pain in a different manner, healthy, and more constructive. I try so hard to tell myself and the hurt parts of myself I am worth more than what I was given ages ago.

It's a bittersweet truth, but I've made some progress. I used to actively hurt myself because I was so used to others hurting me and telling me I was not good enough. I don't do that anymore.",lgydd7,178,0.99,26,2021-02-10 17:12:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/lgydd7/im_about_done_with_emdr_and_ive_come_to_a/,False,False,2021,2
8,I'm 24. Two years ago my girlfriend (soon to be finance) and I wrecked and she passed. I suffered severe injuries and still haven't recovered and the PTSD from this night stops me from doing anything.,"I don't know what I can do. I feel guilty and I feel remorse and I just feel awful everyday. Ever since this accident happened my life has gone downhill. I dropped out of college in my last semester, moved in with my parents, and haven't done anything since. I just can't even leave bed and all of my friendships and relationships fail so I'm constantly alone. I don't even care about waking up anymore and every night I relive that accident. I have severe PTSD and my therapist just tells me to stop it. I don't know how I can stop it. I got pain killers when I got out of the accident and I've been addicted to them ever since. I can't stop taking them and I don't even want to but they're my only way to cope. I just feel hopeless and have no idea what to do. That one night ruined my entire life and I feel like she's the lucky one. 

She was just completely smashed when the car flipped and my bottom half of my body was as well. The images from this night are in my head at all times and I revisit this accident probably a dozen times a day. If something reminds me of this night then I just shutdown and try to get to the ground so I can curl up, plug my ears, and let it pass. It's happened in restaurants and I can't cope with it. I just can't deal with these images and events being replayed in my head. It is a true nightmare. One time the song that was playing when we wrecked came on randomly and I fell to the ground and essentially blacked out like I was having a seizure. I don't know how I can stop this from happening at this point. It's been two years and it seems like they're getting worse. 

We weren't even that drunk and because of a stupid fucking mistake she's gone and my life is miserable. We made this mistake and paid a cost beyond belief and I don't know how what we did was justifiable of these reprocussions. We had wine is all, with dinner.

This is so people're aware about a safety issue in this subreddit. Brigading other subs is not only against the site's TOS, but they can track that you clicked in from this sub. Karma doesn't matter, but Reddit's sitewide rules do.

> I ONLY date women like you. No, I am not some derranged perv with a thing for victimized girls. I am a male survivor with pretty significant trauma and 30 years of PTSD. You are like the perfect woman to me. I don't have to explain a thing, you already get it. People with traumatic childhoods speak a common language. We have similar issues to deal with, maybe even the same triggers. I have been with ""normal"" women. Never again. They are belittling and cruel. You my type and I cannot be alone in this. 1 in 4 girls. 1 in 5 boys. That's millions of people.

Topic title:
> [TW Sexual Abuse] Would you date/be interested in a girl that had been sexually abused as a young child?

Apparently he exclusively dates sexual abuse survivors because they can """"relate"""" to him. Only they also have to be half his age, because he fetishizes age gaps. Oh, and he prefers chubby women because they're ""more giving with themselves"", and ""more willing"". (Don't worry, we'll get to the lovely comments about that!)

Seems *legit.*

That whole suspiciously-enthusiastic, unprovoked, very r/SelfAwareWolves Not A Perv I Swear speech is because multiple people confronted him yesterday-ish about this. He's in full defense mode. Dude sure does like his ""my creepy sexual preferences are all because of PTSD, so I shouldn't have to worry about whether I'm hurting anyone else with them"" excuses.

Normal women are so bitter and cruel...lol. They call him creepy just for wanting to jack off to your sexual abuse, guys. :( This poor victim. There must be a conspiracy among all the woman who aren't half his age and so broken that he seems normal and safe for longer than 30 seconds. Yeah, that must be it.

He gets one creeped-out reply. As with every other comment from someone he creeps out, he immediately ghosts the conversation. Perhaps because he's had this conversation quite often *(for some mysterious reason)* and already knows how it's going to go, and he just doesn't care? 

But that's just my best guess at interpreting complete silence from someone who has had no counterargument to ""wtf this is predatory"" besides ""I have PTSD and I'm immature so I've decided it's okay. Anyways, why am I all alone? It's so sad how *""""""normal""""""* women can't stand me, even tho I'll never post a specific example because people sure do always agree with the womens' concerns whenever I do.""

> Be cool. You guys are smack in the middle of that amazing young, lusty, passionate, mind-blowing sex phase that makes life worth living. Just go with it and try not to over-think the situation. Instead of panic about how you might fuck it all up in the future, live in the moment. Appreciate the fact that this girl is super into you right now. Nothing lasts forever, especially not these white-hot hookups. That doesn't mean they aren't worthwhile. Have high hopes but keep expectations low. Also, form your own opinions of people. That shade about her being impulsive and emotionally unavailable has little to do with your current situation. That's the past. People can stop being impulsive and unavailable when they enter into a more appealing relationship. It's possible. So, take it as it comes. And if in the end it falls apart, at least you got to experience that passion. A lot of people are too boring and too careful to even allow themselves this pleasure. Let it do what it do.

-------------------
> Skinny girls are okay to look at (sort of) because of the way clothing fits them. Fashionable Western clothing styles are usually fitted to be worn by lean women. I don't subscribe to these standards. I like thick women. It's disapointing when a great beauty has no ass on her. That beautiful, big ass on a chubby woman is only part of it, though.

> Skinny women are bony af. Ever lay with a skinny chick? She's all elbows and knee caps. Sometimes a woman is so petite I feel like I might break her on accident. A chubby woman is much softer, and to me, much more pleaseant to lay with. Simply put, they feel better to me. There's one more societal reason guys dig the chubby women of the world.

> They try harder. A thin woman who grew up skinny has never known the ridicule that fat women endure. A woman who's been told her whole life that she's ""hot"" will assume her mere physical presence is enough. I find skinny women are sometimes a bit full of themselves, especially if they're also blonde. Maybe it's just where I grew up, idk? A chubby woman who isn't accustomed to these platitudes and accolades isn't so full of herself. She's typically nicer, more generous with herself, and a more willing partner. It's the same for men, too. People who're told over and over they're the embodiment of some highly desirable feature mistakenly think it's all they need to bring when it comes to relations. Chubby women don't usually fall into that trap. Mad love for the chubs!

Hey look, ***he targets women who ""try harder"" and are ""more willing"" (because they have presumed low self-esteem).***

Oh sure, this poor little victim has noooo predatory motivations when he targets young sexually-abused women. He just wants someone who understaaaaaands him.

> I think you're really good at making excuses for why you cannot do things. Let's be honest here. Many guys are gonna be emtionally abusive regardless of your status as a survivor. What your comment says is you're still filled with lots of trepidation and feelings of unsafe vulnerability. Finding a match is an act of vulnerability. You might be excluding a lot of potentially good matches simply becuase you aren't ready to be vulnerable. It happens. We want recovery to occur quicker than it does and feel impatient we,'re not ""where we should be"". I get the deep lonliness. Remember I said I've had some success on reddit? I have been living in crazy, PTSD induced isolation, waiting 30+ years to find a woman like this. She's a survivor. She gets me. Talk to me in 2050 about your lonliness

You may want to skew your dating search older as a more mature man will (hopefully) not act like such fuck boi. Obviously, anything on reddit has the potential to turn into a gutter.

Gee, I wondered where all the refugees from r/jailbait went! 

Dude just *loves* the obvious pedo-magnet community that inevitably only survives because they insist you lie and say you're 18. I'm not clicking in there, but let me guess: the vast majority of the population is old looking for young. 

What a chickenhawk coop. Let's play a game: guess how many IPs in there are coming from prisons, or the residences of known sex offenders?

-------------------
> C) whatever you do, I strongly advise you to disclose your situation i.e. recovering from sexual assault but tryna get back into dating. The honesty will attract the kind of sensitive, emotionally mature men you're looking for.

**He is literally targeting people** ***in this subreddit*** **and trying to convince them to heal from their sexual violence** ***by ""dating"" guys like him.*** 

And he refuses to even *acknowledge* the multiple power imbalances he clearly gets off on. 

Chubby women is his most legal kink. He doesn't say a single thing about their bodies that he likes, because he doesn't like them: he just looks down on them, and hopes they'll be too desperate and insecure to object to his glaring flaws.

Problem is, adult fat women often don't actually *want* to be with grimy assholes who expect them to abide by an unspoken rule of ""you're fat and worth less, so you should be grateful I even want to fuck you, and not have any standards for me to meet"". 

Just because *he* doesn't value them doesn't mean they're actually going to ""try harder"" - aka, ignore that he's a restraining order waiting to happen, that he likes em young, and that he talks about women like fuckable cattle. 

(And whatever else is horrible behind the scenes that can't be gleaned from literally just his public Reddit activity over the last day or so.)

Guess he's had more luck with sexually-abused teenagers.

Ban. 

Him.

I'm not going back farther in his post history. If this isn't enough, staff just doesn't give a fuck.

PTSD doesn't induce blameless *preferences* in grown adults for sex with insecure teens, insecure sexual abuse survivors, and insecure chubby women. That's not how this works. But it sure does get him misguided sympathy, and more access to sexually-abused teenagers than admitting the truth does.

I used to be a mod on a large mental health support community too. About 1k concurrent users at every hour of the clock. We banned pedos like this regularly. They crawled in to vent about their disorder, which sometimes existed and sometimes didn't, played the victim for a while, then told young girls over DM to take their clothes off.

17,Hairdresser grabbed my face and kissed very close to my lips after haircut. Feeling triggered.,"I've been getting my haircut by a 50+ y.o. Romanian man for over a year now. He's been nothing but professional that entire time. 

When COVID hit, he started to take some clients at his home and he would charge a little less than he would in the salon. 

This was my 3rd time going to his house for a haircut. The other 2 times, everything was normal. Again, professional. Sometimes we would discuss our love lives very briefly. I knew he was dating someone recently and I was happy for him. 

At today's appointment, I wasn't very chatty. I was really tired and just enjoying the feeling of someone touching my hair. When I first arrived and he was about to shampoo my hair, he asked if I had any Valentine's plans tomorrow. I said no, I'm single this year. 

We moved on to the haircut. I noticed he had a glass of wine on his counter. He told me has hadn't eaten today and he's a little tipsy. Ha-ha. I didn't think anything of it.

He asked me if I'm straight... I'm like...""yes?"" He continued the haircut. He asked me, ""Are you on any dating sites?"" I told him I was taking a break from dating, focusing on my new job, etc. 

So, at the end of the haircut, I paid him in cash. I thanked him. And...He grabbed my face with both hands...and kissed me many times on my cheek. Like, on my smile line. Which is really close to my lips. I really thought he'd end up kissing my lips. 

I just froze up. And then he walked me out and told me to drive safe.

I came home. Called my friends and family. Took Vistaril. I'm doing okay now. But I can't stop thinking about it. 

My PTSD comes from a life time and variety of sexual assault. So this was triggering to me. I feel confused. Violated. Naive. Shameful.

0,Let‚Äôs talk about the elephant in the room,"Every time you see PTSD symptoms online or elsewhere, they include the classic symptoms such as flashbacks, hyper vigilance, etc. However, nobody talks about another common symptom, minimizing your trauma. Saying things like, ‚ÄúWhat happened to me wasn‚Äôt that bad. Others have been through worse.‚Äù The reason why we do this is because it‚Äôs our brain trying to protect itself from potentially more emotional damage but in reality, that‚Äôs exactly what it‚Äôs doing, causing more damage. Think of it like a fever. A fever can help you recover. When the fever gets dangerously hot, your body is still using this as a way to protect itself but in reality, it‚Äôs just making the illness worse. 

I also use apps to help with my trauma but none of them have anything to help out with this symptom when they really should as it is a very common and miserable symptom. That‚Äôs all I have to say.

other times I'll completely act & think for a few minutes or a few seconds like how I did at those ages. it's super visceral and freaks me out so much. or I'll even think or very strongly feel like I'm those ages (still with awareness mostly that I'm not. but sometimes there's no awareness for a few seconds.. )",mfe7tv,156,1.0,28,2021-03-29 00:54:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/mfe7tv/does_anyone_else_here_who_had_their_traumas_as_a/,False,False,2021,3
8,Success: able to enjoy sex again (TW: Sexual abuse),"TW: mention of sexual abuse

If you told me only three months ago that I would be having sex again with no trouble whatsoever... I wouldn't have believed you. A break-up, a few therapy sessions and a new partner and it's like I'm living in a different world.

In my last relationship the inability to have sex started 1,5 years before our inevitable breakup. It started with no more PIV sex, then less and less and less sexual interaction until the last half a year nothing happened. I thought it was because of my other traumas, and was waiting (forever) for therapy to start. Now I've realised that he, too, did not respect my boundaries. I became scared whenever he displayed arousal, afraid he would coerce me into having sex, which would end up being uncomfortable(painful) for me, making the next time worse. I even got triggered by his heavy breathing. (Note: my therapist has since told me that sex should never be painful. If it is, just stop. If you continue your body is expecting the pain next time and tenses up, which just makes it painful again, and there you are in your own vicious cycle)

Now I'm working on my view on sexuality, especially my own sexuality & sexual pleasure. In the meantime I've met this amazing man who always asks for consent and backs off whenever I do not give an enthousiastic yes. My therapist is delighted I get to experience this right now, and for me it's like breathing a sight of relief. I don't even have to say no, though my goal is to be able to say no eventually. For now an ""I don't know"" is enough for him to not go further. A simple stop or even just laying my hand on his makes him stop as well. I never imagined it could be that easy. No whining, no passive aggressiveness, no disappointment, just happy to be doing whatever we're doing and just staying there.

The first time we met he asked me if he could give me a hug at the end. He saw my hesitation and immediatly said ""oh, that's a no, that's okay."" I felt the need to explain myself, of course, it was only because of covid, but it wouldn't have been necesarry with him. He was fine either way. It's been that way every step of the way, and I am so glad I get to experience this cause even if we don't end up working on the long term, I now know that there are good men out there who will respect your boundaries, and I will not put up with anything less ever again. 

I am starting to enjoy sex again and I'm just so happy I do. They haven't ruined it forever for me, I can heal and it's me that gets the credit for that. I am taking my power back.",m8psfb,156,0.99,17,2021-03-19 20:06:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/m8psfb/success_able_to_enjoy_sex_again_tw_sexual_abuse/,False,False,2021,3

They seemed so young and innocent playing together, it shocks and sickens me how someone could even think about taking that away from a 9yr old. I loved High School Musical. My room was pink everywhere- the walls, carpet, my bed etc. I doted on my Siamese cat, Lola. I loved my two pet rats but was allergic to them. I used to excitedly wait for my dad to get home from work so I could play on the PS3 with him. I would go for walks with my nan on the weekends along the beach, and run off and twirl towards the sea to feel free. 

Then that October I met someone on MSN who I thought was 13... and it escalated from there. My innocence was ripped away from me. From then on, all I knew was fear. Anxiety. Crying. My mum couldn't figure out what was wrong with me. I kept it secret for all these years, terrified whenever the phone or doorbell rang that it was him coming to get me. To tell all my family how disgusting I am. 

It's never hit me how young I was before. This is the first time my brain has actually allowed me to think about all of this.",mgc7dw,142,1.0,17,2021-03-30 09:41:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/mgc7dw/its_just_hit_me_how_young_i_was_during_my_trauma/,False,False,2021,3
11,"My trauma story. I swear it's true, I can't make this up. There is HOPE!","Cliff notes of my life:

My dad murdered my mom when I was 1 years old, which sent me to foster care then to an emotionally abusive grandmother. 18 years of horrible bullying by my peers because I had a cleft lip and palate.

I fixed all of that only to have a child who inherited an extreme expression of my genetic abnormality that caused my cleft. She had tetrology of fallot (a serious heart abnormality) and other issues. I won custody and worked very hard to get her to a point to attempt a repair of her heart. In 2007 She was 3 and I made the decision and took her for surgery. 4 surgeries and 10 days later I was forced to make another decision. I scheduled the time to end life support and had to watch. Was the final straw.

11 years of alcoholism later (July 5, 2018) I drowned while intoxicated in front of my healthy 3 year old and 10 year old. 10 minutes underwater, 3 days in coma and thought to be brain dead, I woke up.

Took me 1 more year to get completely sober. Sober since June 2019 and I have also conquered my PTSD. There is HOPE. Do not give up and please get help.

14,Has PTSD played a part in you walking away from God?,"I was raised in a ""Christian home"", and for many years I believed in the theology that I was taught from a young age. However, due to incidents that happened to me during my childhood and my adult life I found it put strain on my religious beliefs. They're not the only reason I turned away from God, as I've put myself into the agnostic category because of faults I've found with Christianity, as well as the idea of a personal God. But my personal reasons have nonetheless played a part in it. How could they not?

Even if there is a personal God (as in a God that cares about you and what you do, listens to your prayers, etc) I've found the idea of wanting to having a relationship with him to be (for lack of a better word) difficult. I have a friend who I sometimes talk to, and her advice usually goes something like this: 

\- God loves us. He will make something good out of all of this suffering.

\- God is good.

\- Trust. Believe. Keep the faith.

These phrases sound inspiring, but I find them to be shallow and simple. I think it's easy for a person who does well in life, or goes through something hard and comes out better for it to give thanks to God. But what about all of the people God doesn't help? Everyday, as I drive to or from work, I see homeless people sitting on the side of the road living in tents, I hear about people being raped and murdered on the news. I hear about people being kidnapped and being held for years against their will. I see greedy politicians on TV who are legally stealing from the citizens they are supposed to serve. I see war and disease. 

Perhaps I'm jaded, but I find this constant rat race we're in to be tiring. 

If there is a God, I find myself not wanting anything to do with him anymore. I don't want to worship him, I don't want to know him. At one time I may have. But I found him to be rather impersonal for a God who is supposedly personal. Where were you God? Where were you when I was being abused? Why didn't you stop it, or give me the strength to stop it on my own? And after each time, as the abuse happened over and over again, you expect me to come crawling back to you looking for love and protection and a relationship? I don't want to. I'm sorry God, but I don't love you. I don't love your creation. I don't want to be a part of it. I didn't ask for this. I have so much hate and disgust in me that I want nothing to do with you. And yes, I guess according to Christianity I may go to Hell for saying that. But you know what? When I die, I don't want an afterlife. I don't want your Heaven or your Hell.

For 2 years he has been verbally abusing me, gaslighting me and treathening me.
We have had meetings on meetings than never helped.
And today was the day I feared the most,mediation. 

And I went through with it, I owned it.
I was scared shitless,I could not eat,my anxiety was at an all time high but I did it.
And im proud of myself, because for once I did not just sit there nodding my head saying yes to things I disagreed on.
No, I went in there full force looked him deep into his eyes and I said 

""I dont trust you,I dont respect you and I dislike you, but still im sitting here today trying to come to an agreement for our son.
It.felt.so.good.
It felt so damn good to finally being brave enough to tell him that. And when he gave me a letter from his lawyer where he treathened me that if I dont share custody he will take me to court.

I was even braver, again I looked him into his eyes and said no, he replied ""well ill take you to court"" and what I said its insane for me to even write ""Well then bring it on"". 

I am so proud of myself, I dont care that I have not been able to eat all day or that I feel like a truck has run over me. Im so damn tired I cant think straight, but none of that matters because I
I faced my abuser,I raised my voice,I stood my ground.

I was never an angry person and I'm dealing with the fact my head compartmentalized things in such a way that when I observe myself now as a whole, I feel like I should recognize better when I feel angry and I'm doing things defensively. I tend to be oblivious of my faults at those times.
But on the other hand, if I focus on my faults I have a hard time speaking for myself because my head is 100% focused on ""I fucked up"", I can't place what the other person's done in perspective. I give up too much on myself.

21,Realized my dreams are actually nightmares and now I'm rethinking what's normal,"I was diagnosed with PTSD last week, which didn't surprise me - I'm a survivor of child sexual abuse and spent 25 years living in shame from that abuse. I went to a psychologist for an ADHD evaluation and instead got diagnosed with PTSD and depression. Since then, I've been thinking about something the psychologist pointed out.

He asked me if I have nightmares and my immediate reaction was no. But then I started thinking and remembered that sometimes, I wake up afraid and crying and can't remember the dream. And then there's also this weird thing about me and my dreams where I'm always being chased or hunted, but those aren't nightmares because I have them all the time and they don't make me afraid. Possibly because I never get caught. I just can never escape - I always have to keep running.

He called those nightmares. I talked to some friends last night and they agreed. And now I'm recalibrating what a nightmare is, because..... they're right. Which means that my ""dreams"" are mostly nightmares and have been for 20+ years and I never knew it. Because I didn't know what a nightmare was and thought these were normal.

22,Is doubting own trauma common? TW: Abuse,"I need advice from objective people (tldr at bottom). 

Years ago I (M) said no to someone (F) who wanted to have sex with me. She asked and I said I wasn't comfortable with that. She asked again and I said I didn't want to. We were sitting down at the time. She got on top of me and I froze as she had sex with me. I didn't push her off. She tried to kiss me and I tried to turn away but was unable to. The whole thing was very brief. I didnt think too much about it for years after (i had the mindset of 'I am male so it isn't the same' ) and I have been on good terms with her since. 

I went for therapy a couple years ago and was diagnosed with PTSD. My therapist at the time focused a lot on why she acted she did at the time and in the years I've known this person I've learned she was sexually assaulted by guys before I knew her. Likewise I was sexually assaulted by an older boy when i was very young. I gradually began to understand why she acted the way she did and also why I froze (i was beaten up a lot as a kid too and i would always freeze then as well). To that end I hold no anger towards her, as she was a product of her suffering. It helped me move on for a time. She's changed. I've changed. We've grown and now we are supportive of each other. I have forgiven my other attackers as well as part of my own journey. 

The problem I have is that sometimes I doubt the whole thing and now I blame myself. Its like 'i hold no anger, i understand why she was like that' but now I question whether I was raped at all. 

**Tl:DR: **  I guess I'm just looking for a more objective outsider opinion: Given that I said I didnt want sex twice and then didnt fight back, I was still raped, right? Being on good terms now and understanding why that happened doesnt invalidate my experience does it? Is my self doubt just a part of the PTSD?

0,"Just a tiny rant: I hate how pop psychology and social media has ruined certain terms like 'trauma,' 'disassociation,' and 'intrusive thoughts.'","If you're in the older crowds you might now see this as much but I hate how these words became little trendy quirks to have or use as memes on social media. I've also kind of just resented how they've become part of mainstream vernacular and not in a good way you know? 

For example I saw someone describe an incident where their friend read their journal too their crush in 7th grade as ""traumatizing"" like...genuinely they believe they have trauma from this. It's really insulting and frusterating you know? Like yeah that would be VERY embarrassing and mortifying but like C'mon. You're an adult now, build a bridge and get over it. There's ""Don't compare your trauma to others,"" and then there's shit like that. It just irks me when people act like every tiny hardship in their life is ~trauma~. No. You don't know what that word means. That word actually means something to people and to mental health professionals.

I also hate how terms like ""disassociate"" or ""intrusive thoughts"" became a quickly personality trait and then memes. Because even though my psychologist has identified these for me and said that what I'm experiencing, I still don't like to say that's what I'm experiencing. Like I feel like I'm making it up to be quirky or be funny or some shit. But it's not...I will struggle with talking to my therapist about having trouble with intrusive thoughts or not knowing where I was the last 4 fucking hours because I got triggered and disassociated. It's not fun. It just makes me feel stupid. I'm sick of my mental illness and trauma being the trendy personality trait of the year.

I don't know if it's because I've always been extremely uncomfortable with expressing emotions/witnessing displays of emotion, but when I have a a flashback or an episode I feel like I'm being really overdramatic. Like I'm being very performative and I have this voice in my head telling me that I'm being way too dramatic, to reign it in and that I'm obviously just faking it for attention. This also come along with me downplaying things which is a coping mechanism of mine. Like telling myself my trauma ""isn't even that bad"" or that it doesn't warrant PTSD etc. 


Now I can rationalise these thoughts because my physical symptoms aren't fake. I can't stop the shaking and the hyperventilating. I also hate attention/being fussed over, if anything I get extremely embarrassed. But I was wondering if this is a typical thing? To have your brain tell you that you're just faking it and that it's not that bad?

5,Infantilization of sexual assault victims? Trigger warning for mentions (not descriptions) of assault,"I‚Äôm curious about whether other people have experienced this, or feel that it‚Äôs annoying in any way.  
It seems to me that there‚Äôs a very particular way we talk about victims of sexual assault, and that it‚Äôs different from the way we talk about other people who have developed ptsd.  
For example: I recently got invited to a virtual event for survivors of sexual assault where we are supposed to write love letters to our former selves.  It‚Äôs all very ‚Äúglitter and craft scissors‚Äù.  
Even the metaphors used to talk about us are often full of things like butterflies and flowers blooming after a forest fire.  Very saccharine and childish.  
And when I was looking for resources about sexual recovery after trauma, everything I found was focused on gentle, romantic, candles-and-soft-music sex.  There seemed to be no general understanding that some people looking for sexual recovery might just want to, excuse my language, have fun and fuck.  I found it all very flowery and unhelpful.  
I guess I feel like it‚Äôs dehumanizing.  Like it ties in with the way we expect women to be sweet and innocent and pretty, and so when something ugly and real happens to us it‚Äôs got to be buried in sunshine and sugar.  I would far rather we just be seen as grubby little humans like everyone else.  
Am I alone in this?  I don‚Äôt see military PTSD getting the same treatment (nobody is asking veterans to sit down with glitter and craft scissors to write love letters to their former selves).  I mean no offence at all to anyone who prefers this kind of language, and I‚Äôm so happy for anyone who is helped by it.

Hypervigilance, anxiety, depression, nightmares, etc., all can wreak havoc on our bodies. I used to think I had some underlying illness or that I always was getting the flu. Now I understand how PTSD symptoms can put a great strain on my body and I try to have more self-compassion and acknowledge that my pain is real.

8,Comparing yourself to who you were before your trauma / Mourning who you could have been without trauma,"TW: childhood sexual abuse

I know it's unhealthy to keep wishing that some things didn't happen or complain about life being unfair, but goddamn is it unfair sometimes. it's pretty useless to mourn the person you could've become without the trauma because that person simply doesn't exist. I just still feel envious sometimes of everyone who hasn't experienced sexual abuse. 

Before I was abused as a child, I was a lot more talkative and extroverted. The year after the abuse happened teachers started expressing their concerns to my parents, that I am unassertive in class, too shy, etc. What would my life be like if some horrible things never happened? I know I need to stop thinking about it. Today is just one of those days I feel angry again that I am one of the many unlucky ones who were born into a dysfunctional family. I have done some EMDR therapy and made tons of progress already, have a loving boyfriend now, but I still get setbacks. I know it's all part of the recovery process, but today I just wanted to express my grief. I feel unable to talk about this to people in my life, because they wouldn't understand. 

I wish I didn't have to get triggered during sex. It's so maddening. I feel angry that I should even have to remember horrible events of the past. If I never got abused these flashbacks wouldn't have to happen... Sometimes you think you're making progress and doing well and then those traumatic memories just punch you right back in the face :D.

15,I just need to tell someone,"TW: suicide attempt


My now wife attempted suicide 5 or so years ago by overdose. It was really serious. She was on life support for 9 days and then spent two more weeks in the ICU. 

I managed to get her to the hospital in time. I was with her in the ER. She was awake and talking fine and suddenly started seizing. They rushed me and her parents out of the room into this tiny private waiting area. We sat there waiting for hours. A doctor came in and said she might not make it through the night. She got put on life support. I practically lived at the ICU family room. I‚Äôve been told I fell asleep leaning on her bed. Her kidneys started failing and her whole body swelled up. They said if she survived she probably wouldn‚Äôt be the same mentally. 

She managed to make a miraculous recovery. Like an actual miracle. But her recovery was hard to watch. When she woke up it seemed like she was empty. I watched a nurse feed her soup and her eyes were just blank. You‚Äôd ask a question and she‚Äôd just nod to anything she said. She wasn‚Äôt able to talk for a while. Slowly she got more and more like herself. After that she couldn‚Äôt walk. They aren‚Äôt quite sure what happened, maybe the seizure, but her leg is fucked up. There‚Äôs extensive nerve and tendon damage. She‚Äôs able to walk ok now but it‚Äôs painful and she limps. Sometimes she needs a brace and a cane depending on how bad it is. She lost all of her memory from the year prior. She can‚Äôt remember all the good times from then. She doesn‚Äôt remember me proposing.

She‚Äôs completely back to normal now aside from the leg and some memory issues. I love her with everything in me. She‚Äôs my world. But the thoughts keep creeping back. I can see all of these things clearly in my head. The seizure, the doctor saying she might not make it, the respirator, the soup, the blank stare, all of it. It terrifies me. I want it to stop.

16,Stopped a Panic Artack in its tracks!,"I was at the dentist office with my son, and a very angry man came in to complain to the management.  A petite woman came out to talk to this tall guy, and he kept shutting her down - cutting her off, interrupting, raising his voice.

I got triggered hard.  Started hyperventilating, heart started racing.  I tried the ask them guy to have a seat, because he was elderly and using a walker.  He refused, saying he was too mad to sit.  So then I just came right out and told him ‚Äúlisten, I know you‚Äôre mad - it‚Äôs palpable and I can feel it all the way over here- but could you do me a favor, and maybe sit down for a second?  You‚Äôre triggering my PTSD from working with the Army, and I would really appreciate it if your could bring yoir volume down a bit too please.‚Äù

After that, the office lady came to escort him into an office - and asked if I would like to go into one when he loudly refused too.  She could tell I was shook.  I decided to go Outside instead.  Then I decided to LEAN INTO the panic attack (I was crying and shaking and it was hard to breathe).  I just started a YouTube channel on talking openly about mental
Health issues and how I deal with my conditions as naturally as possible.  So I got my phone out and FILMED my Panic Attack - and how I was able to calm Myself down.  

And it worked!  I got out my essential oils and worry stone and did deep breathing and practiced gratitude.  My panic attack went away, and I was able to go back into the office and not feel like a complete loser for losing my shit in there.

Although he makes me angry for what he did the people who sat and watched him to things to me make me more angry. I have so much hatred for everyone and everything because I can‚Äôt trust anyone and people are so unreliable. 

Not even at my possible death will someone come to save me. I‚Äôm so glad I don‚Äôt remember the faces of who witnessed it because I swear I would go berserk. I have never felt such rage for people in my life and even though it‚Äôs bad for me to say I hope those people suffer including my ex boyfriend.

1,PTSD education should really be more of a thing,"For background I am a survivor of the Route 91 shooting in Las Vegas.

My family does not understand PTSD. Most if them don't believe it is a real thing. This morning my Uncle felt the need to send me footage from a shooting that happened at their local hardware store yesterday. ""You used to work in a hardware store. I thought you should see this. A shooting happened at our hardware store the other day""

I have not opened the link. Maybe it is totally benign and wouldn't bother me at all. Or maybe I'll open it and the anxiety will ensue. I would rather not find out.

I do not expect everybody in my life to cater to my needs or walk on eggshells because of my PTSD. I do, however, expect someone like my Uncle to use common sense and not send me something that obviously hits way too close to home.

This is a vent, not about my uncle and his actions, but about the lack of PTSD education to the general public. I don't believe he sent me that link to be mean.

I thought I'd share this both because I could use the support and because I think people may find solace in knowing that others share their struggles even at an older age.

I'm in my early 40's, and a father. This past week I blocked my mother's phone and all of her social media contacts. She abused me physically and mentally over the course of my childhood. She even helped cover up the sexual abuse of one of her boyfriends. All so she could continue getting a child support check. Throughout adulthood I still kept in touch, even though almost every conversation revolved around either shaming me for my life's choices, or begging me to assure her that she was a good parent. 

After finally convincing myself (with the help of my therapist) that I needed to just cut all ties, it still took me several days to block her on different platforms. A part of me kept waiting for her to notice, but nothing ever happened. It's been a week, and I'm both glad I finally took steps to cut all ties and scared of her potential reaction. Has anyone else gone through something similar when cutting ties with a childhood abuser?

10,Holy shit therapy works. Crying with happiness.,"It's only in the last few years I've had the diagnosis (29f). Previously I've had counselling after a bad patch in university, then went on some anxiety/depression courses after that but it never quite fit. It was only when the mental health service asked if I'd ever considered PTSD then asked me a bunch of screening questions and it fit to a tea. 

I've had some EMDR therapy which was hard and horrible but helped. I did a lot of self soothing for my inner child. Had a lot of dissociative episodes after heavy sessions. Had terrible nightmares for years. Felt rubbish and fatigued for years. My therapist left the service but I was feeling 80% better. 

I had stressful time at the start of the year (work stress causes more intrusive thoughts and anxiety) and contacted the service again about finishing up cos I felt I still had those symptoms and they would surface with a vengeance. 

Just had a few more intense weekly sessions and the last couple have been awful. But the flashbacks were less clear. Then since my last session I've not had any sleep troubles or nightmares or anything. We rescored my questions and I've gone from around 40 to 8.  I've been discharged from the service and I've just cried with happiness. I feel free and whole.

11,Most unexpected life hack to stop PTSD nightmares,"Haven't had a good nights sleep in years due to PTSD?Cool, me neither!! I was always struggling between having a night full of nightmares or having a restless sleep that doesn't yield any dreams at all. 

This week however I challenged myself to something simple: no phone/computer/tv for an hour before bed. I just did this because I read some stupid article about sleep quality, I didnt even think it would affect my PTSD symptoms. But to my surprise every single night this week I have had NORMAL DREAMS!! (which I havnt had in like 4 or 5 years) Waking up feeling well rested in a way I didn't think was possible. 

Most online PTSD nightmare treatments involve adding more lights to your room at night or programs on your phone designed to interrupt your sleep to stop nightmares, but maybe I was looking at it all backwards.  Maybe the key to avoiding nightmares is to get deeper sleep rather than lighter sleep. It's worth a try!

19,I feel like I'm 'not traumatized enough' to have PTSD,"Growing up, I was raised Christian. I was a queer, paranoid, neurodivergent kid, so the fear of going to hell constantly followed me around. I had many sleepless nights were I was simply terrified that if I didn't constantly apologize to God for doubting if he was real and being apart of the LGBTQ+ community, I would burn in hell. I don't think there was a single church service where I didn't burst into tears because of the guilt I felt.

When I was 13-14, I was sexually assaulted by a 16-17 year old friend of mine. She emotionally manipulated me into thinking she was the only honest one around me, and that I could only trust her. She touched me on my thighs, kissed me, held my waist, grabbed my face, used all of the physical touch she could to reassure me that she was the truthful one. And while I was uncomfy with it, she just laughed off my worries and said that ""it was fine."" I think she might've done something even worse because of the nightmares I keep having, but I don't want to blame anyone for something they didn't do. Nonetheless, I have barely cracked the surface of what I do remember, and I don't feel comfortable sharing all of it.

These two traumatic things have lead to me having nightmares, dissossciating when I get touched, hear certain songs, having full on panic attacks when people try to hug me or hold my hand, not being able to focus sometimes cause my thoughts are so full, and even attempting suicide because of how painful it all is. When I talked about it with my therapist today, she said that I almost definitely have PTSD.

However, while some of me is relieved that I actually have a name to put on what I'm going through, the rest of me feels as though I don't have enough trauma to have PTSD. I wasn't raped (at least, not that I can remember), and while I was sexually assaulted, I can't seem to tell myself that sexual assault is enough to be a cause by itself. I can believe it when other survivors of assault have PTSD, but I feel like my trauma isnt as bad as other people's.

24,Working / existing in a capitalist society triggers my PTSD,"t/w sexual assault

I‚Äôm a survivor of sexual assault and abuse, and as a result I really struggle with situations that make me feel trapped and/or coerced. And I realised recently that this is partly why I struggle with jobs. 

I‚Äôve always felt limited in the types of jobs I can do (due to money, qualifications, experience, and medical needs). So I end up settling for a job that pays decent enough, but is soul-destroying to do, because the alternative is to work a job that is more enjoyable with a purpose I care about, but be too broke to support myself and my needs independently.

EVERY TIME I feel like I‚Äôm forced to choose between these two equally shitty options, I just completely spiral. I get angry, anxious, and depressed on such a deep level. I once saw one of my favourite, most knowledgable and experienced anti-rape activists explain how capitalism is incompatible with a healthy culture around consent, and I completely see why. How can you have an enthusiastic freely-given ‚Äúyes‚Äù to employment, if the only options available are so damaging to your mental and physical well-being? i.e. if the alternative is being homeless and unable to feed yourself? My life feels like it‚Äôs entirely based on a series of ‚Äúchoices‚Äù I‚Äôve been coerced into making.

It‚Äôs hard to articulate and I‚Äôm not trying to get political here or advocate for one ideology over another. I‚Äôm just saying how ‚Äúcapitalism‚Äù or employment in general brings up these feelings as a survivor and how hard it is. 

Like it goes deeper than ‚Äúugh I really wish I didn‚Äôt have to do this work today because it‚Äôs boring‚Äù to ‚Äúoh god I feel like I‚Äôm being coerced into doing something I really don‚Äôt want to do, and these feelings trigger my PTSD from sexual assault which was also a situation where I was made to do things I didn‚Äôt want to do, and it traumatised me.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm sure many people might disagree, I‚Äôm generalising massively as this is just a Reddit post, so there‚Äôs lots of room for contradiction here.

But can anyone else relate? :(",na0evu,111,0.91,48,2021-05-11 16:03:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/na0evu/working_existing_in_a_capitalist_society_triggers/,False,False,2021,5
25,Struggling,"I am a combat veteran. I fought in Afghanistan, I was part of an embedded training team. Our purpose was to train and fight along side our Afghan counterparts. I know my story is not unique, but fuck Memorial Day weekend is hard. 

   I get angry at everyday citizens enjoying the very freedoms generations of military men and women fought for without giving thought to the meaning of the day. It‚Äôs not right, I know. I get mad at the lack of respect for the holiday. It‚Äôs not a day for sales, to get a day off (maybe some time to attend a memorial). It‚Äôs a day of reflection on the men and women who died for this country‚Äôs freedoms. I do enjoy going to cookouts, swimming, and playing with my kids on the long weekend. I make sure before anything fun starts that every member of my household knows what the meaning of Memorial Day is. 

Every day is Memorial Day for me; I have severe combat related ptsd. I‚Äôm racked with survivors guilt over two good friends who perished on our deployment. There‚Äôs not a single day where ptsd doesn‚Äôt play some role in the course of my day. Be it an excessive amount of anger, sadness, guilt, or just over all depression. I‚Äôm still proud of my service though and would do it all over again. 

I‚Äôm a 1st generation American and to me serving in the Army is a point of pride. I wanted nothing more than to repay this country for accepting my parents, thus allowing me to come into being and have freedoms their countries couldn‚Äôt imagine. 

I don‚Äôt know why I went to Reddit for this. I‚Äôm a coward and I wanted to post it on Facebooküò¨",nnm7g5,106,0.95,58,2021-05-29 12:12:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/nnm7g5/struggling/,False,False,2021,5
26,It‚Äôs really frustrating with mental illness in a black household (Tw: Rape/Suicide/ Family trauma),"I can‚Äôt stand when people around you repeat what you say as if they came up with it first and when you tell them ‚Äúyeah that‚Äôs what I just said‚Äù and then they respond ‚ÄúNo, I understand, but blah blah blah‚Äù. I get even more frustrated because they‚Äôre making it seem like you can‚Äôt have any original thought and that that person is more right than you and that it was their idea that they should receive credit for. When my friends ask me what‚Äôs going on I started saying less Bc I‚Äôm not about to go in rounds for sticking up for myself which took a lot to do in the first place. 

This whole week honestly has been so rough. My parents don‚Äôt believe in my multiple mental illnesses Bc they believe I should be able to turn it off when they please and that I‚Äôm too hard to love, so my parents use the tough love approach by leaving me alone and not intervening which they‚Äôve been doing majority of my life and it‚Äôs clearly not working. I wasn‚Äôt ready to explain my mental illness with my parents any further Bc it‚Äôs a lot to get into and not prepared for the emotional rollercoaster afterwards. I already told them I was diagnosed with PTSD, bipolar 1, anxiety and depression 2 years ago, but they kept punishing me and giving me dirty looks when my room wasn‚Äôt clean or if I hadn‚Äôt done the dishes, no support at all, just yelling and bickering. It‚Äôs hard to deal with mental illness in a black household, I told my mom I‚Äôve been suicidal and it shouldn‚Äôt have taken that for her to take me seriously and she thinks it‚Äôs some kind of breakthrough.... they caused majority of my family trauma so your child telling you they have all of this going on with them before and instead of believing them and validating them by giving them extra love, they decide to paint me as a crazy, angry daughter for no reason Bc she believes I didn‚Äôt have a rough childhood caused by them. It frustrates me Bc they don‚Äôt want to take accountability, bu want to credit themselves for my breakthrough by telling them I wanted to off myself. My mother kept invalidating me over the phone saying I never said any of that before and never came to her which is another lie Bc I‚Äôve came to both of them multiple times and they act like it was nothing, I tried to admit myself to the hospital a few years ago and instead of my mother finding me a counselor or therapist she takes me to her minister friend which I lied to the whole time and after that she expected me to be all better and continued to yell at me for my room being dirty... How do you tell your own parents that you were sexually assaulted and raped multiple times and was held at gunpoint by an ex for you to open up credit card accounts with him there ring to hurt my family if I didn‚Äôt comply?! I don‚Äôt understand how parents want you to open up all of a sudden after they are the ones who closed that gate years ago and you don‚Äôt feel comfortable or able to and now they want to take credit. Even on the phone she was still angry with me and that made me feel even worse. I told her I resent them Bc for years I‚Äôve been telling them that I‚Äôve been hurting and that wansnt enough for them so they gave me the cold shoulder and estranged me even more and now that I admitted that I am suicidal AGAIN I have to accept their responses whether ‚ÄúI like it or not ‚Äú she said ‚ÄúNow me and your step day have something to talk about...‚Äù I told her she been had something to talk about but it wasn‚Äôt convenient for her like it‚Äôs always been.",n6y6uy,109,0.97,34,2021-05-07 13:12:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/n6y6uy/its_really_frustrating_with_mental_illness_in_a/,False,False,2021,5

0,fuck forgiveness,"What is with this unhealthy obsession people have with forgiveness? Why do I have to forgive every wrong done to me? Why is it that if I can't forgive I can't move past it (to them)? Why do they think that because I 'can't forgive' that I'm always thinking about it, brooding resentment?

Why can't they just accept that I've been hurt? I will never forget what happened, and it doesn't mean I am dwelling on it and creating resentment in my heart. My intrusive thoughts are not proof that it is constantly on my mind and that it's a sign that I need to just forgive and forget and move on to heal.

This weird obsession with healing in not healthy! Sometimes there is no healing, there is only managing whats left. Sometimes there is never resolution. Sometimes, the person whose been hurt decides the pain is not worth it. Why is that not acceptable? Why is it being a coward?

And fuck you for telling me I need more patience. I've been TOO patient my entire life. I dont have the capacity for patience anymore. I am in constant pain, physical and mental. Why can't I be allowed to say ENOUGH!? Why am I not allowed to have a break? I need a vacation from this pain but there is no leaving it behind.

1,Why do we keep trying to pretend like we DON'T have PTSD? We have PTSD!!!,"Can't we collectively work on getting the world to understand we aren't neurotypical anymore and we have a disability that deserves to be accommodated?? There's going to be more of us after this pandemic is over, so why not start creating a PTSD inclusive world rather than pretending we don't have a VERY valid illness? Is it really so much to ask the world to accept us as we are as long as we aren't being abusive or raging out?

Edit: Thank you for the silver! I wanted to be more clear. I was reading the comments and they were really bumming me out: "" I can't be open about my illness because..."" I had to turn off the notifications. That was never my point. 

Once upon a time, the LGBTQ+ community had to hide themselves. Their lives were in danger. People would murder them... Now it's Pride Month and there is glitter everywhere (and it's also PTSD awareness month). I'm not saying we find individual reasons to stay afraid in the closet. I'm saying we stand up and and be present and counted until the world accepts us and lets us live the way we need to live - with all our own sparkles and no excuses. 

I dream of living in a world where I don't have to pretend to be neurotypical or ""act"" normal. I want PTSD friends, and PTSD supportive businesses where I can spend my money, and a PTSD job that won't fire me for having symptoms - I want our own civil rights movement. Maybe that's too radical for some... It is a fear based disorder. But PTSD is the normal response of a healthy brain under extreme circumstances. I'm not a freak. You're not a freak. I'm a survivor and so are you. Any of the people who bully me could end up with PTSD on any day, and we will already have a community of safety to help them be better people.  (Not get better, because there is nothing wrong with us - we're amazing and we're survivors - but with these sweet soft hearts). We deserve to be protected and included.

I'll see a group of people walk around and imagine them assaulting me and having to defend myself.

12,My dad is trying to force me to re-traumatize myself bc he's too afraid to tell his wife the truth,"Trigger warning: CSA

My step brother molested me when I was 10 years old. We were on a family vacation and he snuck up on me in bed and messed with me.

I kept it a secret forever bc I was mortified. I tried to tell my older brother once, and he didn't say anything to anyone either so I gave up for a while. I eventually told my mom, who immediately told my dad by bitching him out. As far as I can recall, nothing came out of this either bc I was still forced to visit my dad every other weekend and still forced to be sleeping in the same house as this guy until I was 18. 

I definitely developed PTSD and never realized it most my life until I started going to therapy as a 30+ adult. This has caused me so much shame, guilt, re-traumatization, sleepless nights, relationship issues, suicidal thoughts, etc.. You guys know what I mean.

Fast forward to 2019, and I find out from my aunt that my dad is intending to have my step brother over for our family gathering to celebrate my dad and my Nana's bdays (mind you, the rest of the family don't like him either for various reasons like him calling my brother fat and other charming things like that) so I called my dad and let him know how that makes me feel and how I can't be around that guy ever again. Didn't work, had to see the guy, sucked ass for me, etc.

Fast forward to Father's day last night. We're at dinner, and my dad brings up the topic. We're about to have our family gathering for dad/Nana's bday again in a couple of weeks. Dad wants to know how we can ""resolve this."" I tell him that I WON'T be in the same place as my step brother anymore, and that if he intends on having him there, I won't be going. My dad spins a sad tale about how my step brother is getting divorced and only gets to see the kids at certain times and blah blah blah. Basically, he knows his wife wants to have my step bro over that weekend, and he wants to know how he can make it as comfortable as possible for himself. I was under the impression that he told his wife about it in 2019 bc she was in the fucking background, but apparently not and now he's asking me to tell her. 

So now, my father has set me up to re-traumatize myself by telling my story again to my step mother (who has shown support for public figures having allegations against them and blamed victims) about what her son did to me. He was nice enough (sarcasm) to prepare me by saying ""I really don't know what she's going to say to you, she might blow up."" 

If I don't tell her, then my step bro will most certainly be at the party, and I'll either need to be around him again or miss one of my favorite events bc my out of town family will be here to visit.

Thanks for anyone who made it this far.. would definitely be open to any advice if anyone has any.... üò≠

I really needed to hear them because when I'm around him, I tend to cower and let him get away with murder. IDK why I am still so scared to really unleash on him.. he certainly hasn't been afraid to make me feel like shit.

2,PTSD is NOT a mental disorder. It's a mental injury.,"It just isn't. It flat out isn't a disorder, at least not to me. It's a mental injury. A mental scarring, a wound that is having such a hard time closing. There's actually people advocating out there for the name to be changed. I think PTSD can attribute to the development of mental disorders, but to me PTSD in and of itself is an injury. Also part of ptsd being a mental injury is the fact that it can be healed, treated and alot of times fully cured. Its been shown time and time again to be highly treatable just through therapies alone and in some cases goes away on its own with no intervention. Also mind the fact, regardless of the behaviors it causes, PTSD has actuay been shown to still be a normal trauma response.",oe2b57,279,0.95,84,2021-07-05 07:46:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/oe2b57/ptsd_is_not_a_mental_disorder_its_a_mental_injury/,False,False,2021,7

Every single time I‚Äôve smoked weed it made me paranoid and agitated and kinda angry and I hated it. I always get the response that I just need to ‚Äútry a different strain‚Äù or some shit. Well to my knowledge, I‚Äôve never smoked the same one twice and I don‚Äôt live in a country where it‚Äôs legal at all so we don‚Äôt have dispensaries or anything either. Not about to move countries to try different weed either, even if it was a possibility right now.

LSD was even worse, had the most fucked up, traumatising experience the first time I did it and I‚Äôm never gonna touch psychedelics again after that. It was fucking horrible.

7,My manager choked me yesterday.,"TW: physical assault 

For context I have been diagnosed with PTSD for years due to a couple different traumas. 

If it matters, I am female. Yesterday my boss and I were laughing about something, we joke around a lot but up until now he has never laid hands on me. He was about a foot away from me and he abruptly reached out and wrapped both his hands around my neck, squeezed and shook me. He was laughing and didn‚Äôt do it as a serious attack, but nonetheless he fully wrapped his fingers around my throat and choked me. He let go after a few seconds and was still laughing after and I was so shocked that I just nervously laughed and got away from him as soon as possible. It was not a light choke, after he did that I was sore for an hour after. 

I called his boss crying and in shock. Long story short she was PISSED and brought it to HR immediately. I was informed by her today that HR is still deciding what to do - aka, he has not been fired yet. In the meantime he is not working on Monday and I‚Äôm reporting to his boss as my manager until something is decided. 

It didn‚Äôt sink in until after I got away from him and had a moment alone just how messed up it was. I already have PTSD from several traumas and yesterday just keeps replaying in my mind over and over, I‚Äôm worried this will just be another trauma to add to the list. If he isn‚Äôt fired I‚Äôm going to be seriously scared for my safety because this is not the first time I‚Äôve reported him for inappropriate and unprofessional behavior. They are still investigating and I‚Äôve already decided that I am quitting if he is not fired. I love my job, I work in the mental health field and I deeply care for the people I support. But I refuse to feel in physical danger from my coworkers at work. 

I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about yesterday and I could use some kind words right now. :(

**Edit:** I want to thank you all for your advice. I talked to my former divorce attorney asking for recommendations for any of her colleagues who can help me if he is not fired. She was absolutely floored when I told her what happened and told me to contact her after work tomorrow so she can find representation for me if he is not fired. She said it would really be best if I have an attorney with me when I talk to HR but given that this is happening tomorrow there‚Äôs no time for that, so she advised me to record any and all interactions I have with management or HR regarding the situation and to act very carefully. In the meantime I‚Äôm taking care of myself and emotionally preparing for tomorrow.

**Edit 2:** I found out today that he has been fired. I am still shaken up but I am relieved knowing that I won‚Äôt have to face him again or feel unsafe/uncomfortable at work. I did notice bruising and swelling today and took pics which I sent to HR and I am sure that played a part in their decision as well. I‚Äôm seeing my doctor tomorrow and seeing what she recommends to make sure that I‚Äôm 100% okay.

11,Anyone else‚Äôs partner left them after revealing their trauma?,"My boyfriend (now ex) broke up with me the other night after I told him that I ran into the man who sexually abused me throughout my childhood when I went to visit my hometown. I didn‚Äôt ask for comfort, I just wanted to be transparent and texted to let him know what happened and how I was feeling. I told him he didn‚Äôt have to do anything or say anything, but that it was really jarring seeing the man again after so many years. I‚Äôve actively been in therapy and been taking medication for the last 2.5 years. I‚Äôve told him about my trauma before and what happened - he was aware. 

He told me that hearing about this run-in made him realize that if we become more serious or get married in the future, that my trauma would ‚Äúbecome [his] problem,‚Äù and he doesn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúbe a part of that.‚Äù 

I asked for so little from him. He had been upset that I don‚Äôt open up to him as much literally the week before so I tried to open up and let him in, and he broke up with me over it. 

I feel so helpless. I can‚Äôt control what happened to me, and he basically just left because of the trauma. If it was currently affecting the relationship or if I was mentally in a bad place or not seeking treatment, I could have understand- but it feels he left me purely over the fact that it happened to me and is a part of my life story.

He was actually really kind and soothed my anxiety a lot. He had the female nurses put blankets over me and tuck them under me so I would feel more secure.

13,Who else is unconsciously seeks chaos due to being addicted to your own stress hormones? How are you working to change this pattern?,"Who else is unconsciously seeks chaos due to being addicted to your own stress hormones? How are you working to change this pattern?

I really liked this quote:
""Adults addicted to their own stress hormones were once  children who lived in unpredictable environments of overreaction, rage spirals, and fear. Healing is becoming conscious to when we unconsciously seek chaos, why we do it, and how often. With this awareness we can teach our bodies safety in the present."" -Dr. Nicole LePera https://www.instagram.com/p/CRuA4LrACjc/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link

I notice when things get calm, I often will seek out chaos, look for problems or purposely trigger myself by thinking, reading or looking at things that have traumatized me. The I find myself in a trauma vortex where I keep triggering myself everytime I start getting calm. This dysregulated state excites and arouses me. It is familiar and makes me feel less bored. I have an underlying fear of getting better, fear of change, fear of getting my hopes up for it all to go bad again, and an underlying root belief that I don't deserve happiness and love because I am bad and unlovable.

Who else is unconsciously seeks chaos due to being addicted to your own stress hormones? How are you working to change this pattern? How do you cope and stop yourself from going down that path?

lifeless, stone cold, eyes open, legs astray,

BROKEN INSIDE, NO PLACE TO GO IN HER MIND,

SHE TEARS HERSELF APART, TIME AFTER TIME,

seeing his body left and right,

she turns into herself and stabs her heart,

OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

screaming inside.

She's lost inside, doesn't know how to go forward,

she's lost inside, lost inside....

Open your eyes, and look to the present,

see the trees stand firm and present,

take a breath,

18,The Neurobiology of PTSD explained,"Hey yall! So I briefly wanted to explain some of the neurobiology behind ptsd, cus this will give insight and possibly allow you to make some good decisions regarding treatment. So essentially as you probably know, trauma puts us in a chronic fight flight freeze state. When were in fight or flight, our cortisol rises very high giving us the energy to do so. But after a certain point of too much stress, our cortisol downregulates and we freeze. Its our bodies way of saying, ""nope this is too much i cant fight anymore so this has to stop"". When were traumatized our bodies neurochemistry gets thrown way off, so we develop high levels of glutamate, norepinepherine and sometimes dopamine but not always. Our serotonin levels may drop as well as GABA cus when glutamate and norepinepherine go up, serotonin and gaba go down. So were constantly flooded with excitatory neurotransmitters and not enough inhibitory neurotransmitters.

Along with this, high levels of glutamate become excitotoxic, resulting in shrinking of the hippocampus and cell death in the brain. Yes, keeping our stress levels so high in ptsd can cause actual brain damage. Its why for so many people, lamictal/lamotrigine has helped immensely with their symptoms. It reduces glutamate which inadvertly reduces norepinepherine and allows serotonin and gaba to increase. 

Researchers hypothesize that the hyperarousal component of PTSD is mainly due to the high norepinepherine keeping us im an overly sensitive state. Some people have found relief in medications such as clonidine which lower norepinepherine.

Also researchers hypothesize that high amounts of  excitatory neurotransmitters may be the cause for dissociative states, because they keep the body constantly overstimulated.",oumlcn,130,0.99,45,2021-07-30 15:17:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/oumlcn/the_neurobiology_of_ptsd_explained/,False,False,2021,7

And on top of all of that, the more people do not believe in our symptoms the more we are likely to question them ourselves. Which is almost even more tragic. That we can inhabit a body that is clearly reacting to the environment in a way that can be disabling for us, and yet we can sometimes question even our own sanity‚Ä¶",p1ozdg,250,1.0,62,2021-08-10 13:17:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/p1ozdg/ptsd_a_condition_that_has_to_be_believed/,False,False,2021,8
3,It‚Äôs been 27 years since I was raped by a 20 year old. I was 14. I just told him off. May report.,"At age 13, a man saw me riding my bike outside and playing with my sister. 

Back story: My sister and I had experienced a lot of trauma already. We were in separate homes. Our parents were dead, and we‚Äôd survived 2 murders. I was in a verbally and emotionally abusive home. All this led me to feeling worthless and unlovable. 

That‚Äôs why he targeted me. 

Over the course of several months, he stopped to talk to me. Got my number. Started calling and slowly built rapport- I now understand this was grooming. After I turned 14, the calling escalated and he drove over to my house to offer yard work. The male figure of my home had recently died so it was just me and the woman raising me. He flattered her. She was old fashioned and thought nothing of a grown man wanting a young girl. 

Once he got approval, the love bombing started. Before long, the sex. I didn‚Äôt even know what to do or how to do it. In short order, his charm eroded. He began controlling me and calling me ugly and worthless. 

By now, I think this is ‚Äúlove‚Äù. He told me it was love. 

My mental health deteriorated and I ended up suicide attempt with a 2 week hospital stay. I also had a venereal disease that had spread very far requiring iv treatment. 

I got out and the sexual and emotional abuse resumed and one of his friends was after my young friend to boot! 
He never took me on a date. Never showed me any gentleness or tender touch.  He brought one of his friends over to meet me. That friend had some sense and told him what he was doing to me was rape. 

He disappeared abruptly. Tried to come back off and on a few times. I told him off. He did the same thing to five other victims of similar age that I know of!

Over the years, my view of love and relationships was warped by what he did to me. I‚Äôve had other traumas since, but trauma has layers like an onion. This is my core wound regarding men. It took me until I was 40 to realize it!

I made a fake Facebook account and I sent his ass a long winded message about how he victimized me and the state it happened in has no statute of limitations on rape of someone the age I was. 

I still have photos of him and I, not nude, but sexual enough that I believe I could finally report him and possibly get justice. 
It felt good to tell him off. To get my power back.",p6i5dq,210,0.99,20,2021-08-18 02:25:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/p6i5dq/its_been_27_years_since_i_was_raped_by_a_20_year/,False,False,2021,8
4,Tracked down a man who took advantage of me at like 12yrs old,"So when I was like 12 on a game called ourWorld I received a gift from someone. He started talking to me, turns out he's this guy older than my mom. But he was friendly and he gifted me like a month of their premium pass, so I kept talking to him. Eventually we move over to Kik, where the conversation got sexual. He sent me naked photos and videos of himself and coerced me into sending some back. I think he even video called me once. He's married BTW.

Well today I remembered that and gave him a Google, I only remembered his Kik username and [other identifying information]. I was able to find his full name, address, phone number, and email.

So I signed him up for every form of scientology mailing list you can be on. Even signed him up for an in person consult tomorrow, so he'll get a call when he doesn't show.

It's scientology. They will NEVER leave him alone. I won't ever see the fallout of this, but I'm pleased.

5,For everyone who manages their depression with exercise‚ÄîI compiled a comprehensive list of simple bodyweight exercises to do if we have to quarantine and the gyms get shut down again.,"If you're anything like me, you've managed your depression with exercise for awhile and once the gyms closed down last year, it really messed everything up. Personally, I fell back into a deep depression (it was as if I suddenly stopped taking antidepressants!), turned to food and alcohol for comfort, gained 60lbs and did virtually no exercise since the gyms were closed, and didn't even know where to start other than jogging and simple things like squats.

That's why I created a full document of bodyweight exercises that require little or no equipment to help keep us all from backsliding harder if/when we have to quarantine again. Most of them can be effective even if done just a few minutes a day in your bedroom (for those of us who have trouble getting out of bed on those bad days). And I'm sure we all know how sore and stiff our muscles feel when we spend all day laying around.

This list is complete with Cardio, Bodyweight exercises, Mobility, and Stretching. I referenced videos on all of the things I figured most laypeople might not know about. I also included links for the optional equipment for both Amazon and Non-Amazon resources.

If you have any suggestions on anything else to add, I'll gladly keep building on the list! I know a lot of us use exercise to manage depression and when we can't, it becomes a vicious cycle of not having motivation to exercise and then not having any serotonin because you didn't exercise lol

I hope this helps at least a few of you. Let's adapt and conquer this time around, friends. Remember, even a few minutes helps!

7,"I thought ptsd was cool/sexy, it really isn't","I know this is probably really weird but growing up I had this image in my head from tv and shit about what ptsd looked like. It looked like the cool emotionally shut off guy who had seen some shit, it looked like the badass who had killed alot of bad guys, it even looked like the hero firefighter or emt who ran into save people. It never looked like breaking down crying for no apparent reason, it never looked like waking up panting with your heart pounding at 3 am unsure if you're really there or back somewhere, it never looked like feeling powerless and constantly wondering why you got to live. 

Maybe it's just me and maybe i'm wrong but now that i'm here and I've had to struggle so hard these past years i can't help but feel lied to. There's nothing cool about this, there's only pain and rage and fear and sadness and all these things I can't understand and can't fix and it drives me up a wall. I don't really know what else to say honestly.

5,My therapist revealed his goal was to convince me to reconcile with my abusers,"So I (26 F) finished breaking up with my therapist/had my last session yesterday.

I already had a small list of reasons that I'd written down, including him feeling the need to explain misogyny to me, his desire to treat my fear of men as my biggest issue, etc etc when I have a lot of trauma from my abusive parents that I wanted to process.

Before I got into all that though, I had some questions to help me going forward. I asked: what IS processing trauma? What does that look like? and what are the steps to take following that to relieve the betrayal I feel?

In the course of answering these questions he kept coming back to one thing: that must talk to the people who wronged me and explain myself and try and mend the relationship. I asked him then, what would be the next steps if I were talking about an abusive ex boyfriend and he STILL said the only path forward was to meet with the ex (in public because SaFeTy Is PaRaMoUnT) and talk it through with them. which I don't even know if I believe, or if he was just refusing to give me an alternate answer.

In the beginning i was VERY clear that my family was abusive and I had cut all contact with them, and that the reason I had issues with past therapists was BECAUSE they wanted me to reconcile. I thought I had been clear enough. Now it's obvious that no matter what I say, they think I can only want estrangement because I am too ill to knoe what's best. That my desire for separation is because of MENTAL ILLNESS.

8,"Warning: ""The Body keeps the score"" is a disrespectful and damaging book on PTSD with wide acclaim","So I bought the book ""The body keeps the score"" after it was recommended by a mental health youtuber. And I am disturbed at the cult following this book has gained despite spreading very damaging and false information and views.

I have not read beyond chapter 1 and I don't want to.

&#x200B;

1. Author encourages sympathy for war criminals
2. Author dismisses Vietnamese genocide
3. Author devalues trauma of non-Veteran PTSD victims. This is damaging to the PTSD community as it is a widespread and false stereotype that only Veterans ""deserve"" to claim PTSD. Meaning it goes widely undiagnosed. In reality less than 5% of PTSD sufferers are Veterans. It has taken DECADES to dispell this stereotype and he just reintroduced it. Good job.
4. Author expresses his opinion that the suffering of Veterans is greater than that of rape victims. Which is weird and highly inappropriate for a psychiatrist. It doesn't matter if one persons pain is not as great as another's, they still deserve to seek help. It's made even weirder by how he defends and expresses sympathy for actual rapists. Going as far as saying ""they were traumatised by their own actions"" WTFFFF????
5. That's not trauma, that's guilt. By definition, trauma is something that happens to you, a psychiatrist should know that.
6. Author references the Nazi's but doesn't actually condemn their actions which is suspicious. In fact he seems to be on the wrong side of the Nuremberg trials. While at least the Nazis could claim that they were following orders, the Veterans he defends committed their rape and child murder out of fun
7. He is Dutch, which is where I live. Therefore I know he would have had to read Hannah Arendts ""the banality of evil"" in high school and been exposed to thought experiments and debates on whether following orders counts as warcrime and how much personal responsibility soldiers have since 1st grade. He even grew up during the Nuremberg trial, and claims his father was imprisoned in a concentration camp during WW2. It's not like he is an American who has never been exposed to or had to actually think about these topics. It's like he came up with a strange twisted defence of warcrime to rationalise what happened to his father.
8. The message of the book seems to be ""forgive your rapist, he suffers more from the trauma of your rape than you do""

And don't even get me started on all the scientific inaccuracies and absolute lack of references. All his claims are based on personal experience supported by anecdotes. It referenced discredited techniques, like Rorschach tests, seriously? This book came out in 2016. I legitimately thought this book predates ""Banality of evil"" and the Nuremberg trial considering how immature and underdeveloped his theories are.

Absolute garbage! Hope it gets cancelled before it does more damage to the PTSD community. This is the equivalent of the ""vaccines cause Autism""- paper for PTSD.

EDIT:

Since so many people are trying to gaslight me into denying that what I say actually happens in the book, I wanted to share a quote I found on the goodreads review page of this book, so that you have more than just me as a source that this book is problematic, and that the things I state actually happen in ch1. [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693771-the-body-keeps-the-score](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693771-the-body-keeps-the-score)

"" As a survivor of sexual abuse and trauma, I found this book triggering and lacking the enlightenment I expected, given the reviews. I felt the author showed more compassion for the soldiers who raped and murdered than the rape victims, and the ways in which he discussed the two left me feeling the women weren't as well humanized. Speaking about this with another trauma survivor, she shared that the author was removed from his own trauma center for creating a hostile work environment for women employees. There are articles to confirm it. I rarely‚Äîif ever‚Äîdon't finish a book, but I'm shelving this one. [(less)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693771-the-body-keeps-the-score#) "" sep 2019

EDIT 2

His Rorschach study was plagiarised from a Rorschach study during the Nuremberg Trials on Nazi War criminals. Nothing wrong with repeating a study, but he doesn't credit it whatsoever and portrays it as though he came up with the idea to Rorcharch test war veterans.

18,TW SA: I NEVER WANT TO HEAR THAT SA ACCUSATIONS RUINS A MAN'S LIFE,"Never in my life since experiencing all this did I ever think this would be a response from a person when I told them their employee assaulted me. I always thought I would hear ""Well there is no forensic evidence"", ""you're lying"" or ""you should have done xyz"". But what I read in that email broke my heart to pieces that none of those statements could have ever. For some context, I sent an email to his current employer to warn them of his past behavior that got him fired from a job before. In this job, he works with young women who are just barely adults and are so susceptible to abuse because their naive and just learning how to set boundaries and handle their alcohol, just like when I was raped by him. I was 18 and he was seven years older. Not saying that's what makes it rape, what made it rape was when I said no over and over and pushing him away throughout the assault, but it does show a power dynamic that gave him the ability to manipulate me into a position where we were alone and I had no way to escape. Anyway, this is what the email said. 

""Thank you for taking the time to write this email, and for the bravery to send it. I imagine it is not easy to remember or recount these things, and appreciate you sharing for the benefit of others.¬†

(His name) proactively disclosed this information to us when he began working for us, as well as its impacts on his work with (name of company). We keep it in consideration when thinking about his guiding work. It has felt important to us that (his name) has owned his mistake, and been transparent about his reflection and change. It also feels important to know, as you say, so that we would be attuned to anything that might suggest this is a pattern.¬†

I really appreciate you coming forward, and wish you all the best in your journey."" 

I have some seriously mixed feelings. I'm relieved to hear that he admits these things happen because now I don't have to constantly question whether I was crazy and making it up in my head. 

On the other hand, they let him off pretty much scot-free because he seemed remorseful. He has never reached out to me to tell me he was sorry or pay reparations (because fuck yeah I'm demanding money after he fucked my life up into pieces) It just makes me sick. I don't want a single man to ever tell me again that rape accusations ruin a man's life. My rapist told a future employer, showed remorse (without it involving the actual victim), was given a pass for a ""mistake"" and was given a job at a prestigious guide company. Never want to fucking hear rape accusations ruin a man's life EVER AGAIN.

Oh and also they talk about being ""attuned to a pattern"". Something has to happen twice for it to be a ""pattern"". They care more about this man's guide career than the wellbeing and safety of any woman he comes into contact with.

I right now just really need someone to explain how this could ever be ok. Maybe you've experienced the same thing. How do I ever have faith in our world or society again? How do I live with this?

I have a lot of other stories (let me know if you‚Äôd like to hear more,) but here is one that really never left my head. When I was 8 (21 now,) I lived in an apartment with my mom, my brother, and me. My mom was addicted to amphetamines and was always living in this ghostly world. I remember her doing Oracle readings with me, I remember her having seances, and I remember me having strange things happen to me as a kid that I couldn‚Äôt make sense of. I kept coming to my mom with these problems and she believed I was possessed by a demon. I remember her taking me out to the the kitchen and there was a man with a cross on. He read the Bible over me and put holy water on my head and I just remember my mom screaming ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your name, what‚Äôs your name!?‚Äù And as an 8 year old I was confused I was scared and I was in shock. I told her I was me and she proceeded to say it was demon speaking for me. I remember looking up at the ceiling fan And I started following one with my eyes and from there it felt like I left the whole room. That was the first time I ever dissociated and it hasn‚Äôt stopped since that day. My mom went to prison and has been clean for many years now. I just recently asked her about this and she still truly believes that there were demons in that house and that was the end of it. Not the closure I needed.

I have several close friends who are deeply interested in serial killers and true crime. They even have ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù serial killers. Now, I‚Äôm open to the idea that the psychology behind why people commit crimes could be fascinating. 

However, I find it disgusting when people are buying clothing with pictures of serial killers on it. It‚Äôs not edgy or quirky. It‚Äôs glorifying them. They are NOT celebrities and the only acceptable place for their faces is on the bottom of your shoe. 

As someone who was the victim of a violent crime-as someone who truly believed I was going to be killed by my rapist (a stranger whom I trusted to help me, who held me captive overnight) I can‚Äôt stand how people romanticize violent people like Ted Bundy, Ed Kemper, and Brian Laundrie right now. Murder, rapes, attacks, and the investigations that follow are messy, gritty, and sad. 

True crime treats the victims of trauma like characters in a story. Imagine if your trauma, or abuser, or rapist, was glorified. Victims are eventually reduced down to names and ages. The offender gets some sort of sick celebrity status and a movie deal on Netflix 

I just think it‚Äôs so unfair to the victims who are no longer living, to the family of victims, and to future victims of abuse, rape, and murder.

10,being gaslighted by my therapist?,"tw- mentioning sa, nothing graphic or specific 

recently, i‚Äôve really felt like i‚Äôm being gaslighted by my therapist.

we‚Äôve been doing trauma therapy for a few years now and i‚Äôve recently decided i‚Äôd like to take a break and focus on my current life. since then, i‚Äôve really felt like he‚Äôs gaslighting me.

first, he keeps bringing up my trauma and asking if it ‚Äúreally happened‚Äù i never know what to say when he asks. sure, healthy skepticism is valid, but he‚Äôs my therapist i‚Äôve been working with for years and it feels like a betrayal of trust. 

i told his yesterday ‚Äúi feel like you don‚Äôt believe me‚Äù and his response was ‚Äúno. i believe you more than you believe yourself‚Äù which felt like he was lying. if he wasn‚Äôt then why has he repeated asked me if i was faking? 

he‚Äôs frankly asked some really out there questions too. he think i should get a hymen check to prove what really happened happened. that made me EXTREMELY uncomfortable because a) i‚Äôm not even pursing legal action against my abusers at the moment b) hymen checks aren‚Äôt a good indication of sexual abuse and c) he should believe me unless i say otherwise. i even told him that was out of line and he said it was ‚Äújust a thought‚Äù

when he makes me uncomfortable or pushes me to speak about something when i don‚Äôt want to i tell him ‚Äúi‚Äôm not ready to talk about this yet‚Äù and he told me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going back to day one in therapy‚Äù

which is really, really ironic because day 1 me had no sense of boundaries and always let him drive the conversation. i‚Äôve finally built the confidence to advocate my needs and he treats me like that‚Äôs a bad thing. it makes me feel like i should just listen to him because he knows best and maybe i‚Äôm wrong for speaking up. 

sorry this was so long. i just wanted advice from others if this is normal behavior for a therapist or if i‚Äôm being gaslighted. i don‚Äôt use the word gaslight lightly but he‚Äôs making me doubt my own reality and perception of what happened to me. 

does anyone have any thoughts or advice? it would be appreciated",r5nktn,109,0.98,96,2021-11-30 13:44:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/r5nktn/being_gaslighted_by_my_therapist/,False,False,2021,11

3,I identify more with 'victim' than with 'survivor',"Last year I was having some counselling sessions for my trauma while waiting for help from mental health services, and my counsellor was totally baffled when I said that I identified more with the word victim than the word survivor. She asked, isn't survivor more empowering?

For some people it is, but not for me. I'm not a survivor,  I wasn't struck by lightning, I didn't have cancer, I didn't 'survive' a random event. I'm a victim, not because I'm weak or belittled, but because this was *done to me by another person.* My trauma was a deliberate act done to me by someone else, they deliberately victimised me, and I need to process it as such. 

The word 'victim' has such horrifying stigma, and - don't get me wrong - replacing it with 'survivor' is crucial to other PTSD sufferers' self-definition. But for me it has never sat right. There's an assumption even in trauma services that calling yourself a victim is limiting yourself, or not being strong, having the tendency to see yourself as weak, or not acknowledging how you've powered through it all. Often it's the idea that once you see yourself as a victim or 'victimise yourself' you become pathetic, oversensitive, overreactive, less capable, less than. But I'm none of those things.

I can't process my trauma without accepting and being vocal about its origins. I didn't 'survive' this, because it isn't over. But accepting that I was someone's victim doesn't mean I'm all of the negative connotations of 'victim'.",r9il8e,255,1.0,63,2021-12-05 15:56:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/r9il8e/i_identify_more_with_victim_than_with_survivor/,False,False,2021,12

I don‚Äôt take pride in my trauma or PTSD, but I hate that, because tons of people are jumping on the bandwagon, it makes it seem that my actual PTSD which I earned the old fashioned way (by experiencing a traumatic event that was listed in the DSM-V) is just ‚Äòa trend‚Äô and not real, substantial and horrific. 

War. Rape. Catastrophic accident. Child abuse. These are things that are so horrible that your brain gets stuck in a permanent state of ‚Äòdanger!‚Äô level arousal. These are things are so wildly outside of the mind‚Äôs ability to cope with that the mind just shuts off those areas completely.

I don't want to drag this on so to put it shortly: my mom did bad things to me when I was little. I visited my hometown and lived with her for a few months recently and it was a nightmare. I started feeling sick and my relationship with my mom was just as bad as it had always been growing up. When I went home I was still sick and I was supposed to start treatment for PTSD once I got into therapy again. I watched her hurt my dad over and over as a kid. She took me in the shower and told me I smelled bad that I wasn't showering right, and she would touch me and threaten me. She told me to kill myself and to hurt myself so many times. She was on drugs most of my lifetime. I stopped talking to her because she was my trigger and I had no respect left for her. She tried to contact me and taunt me saying she was going to take my tax money again, I called and my aunt picked up, I was very upset and started yelling.

3,Does anyone sob randomly about the past? Is this normal or a symptom of PTSD?,"I've had PTSD for some years now and am only recently in an environment that is healthy and stable. I've realized that I've been in survival mode since I was 14. I'm now 22. I've repressed a lot of the trauma, or at least my emotions surrounding it. I feel happy, healthy, and satisfied with my life currently. I've never felt better but sometimes I randomly get overwhelmingly sad or have a rush of emotions about an event that happened in the past. I'll get sucked into a memory but it's more centered on the emotions I probably should've felt during the time than the actual event. I refer to them as emotional flashbacks but I'm not sure if that's the correct term or if there's even a term for it. I'll cry and cry. It can be debilitating but then once I'm done crying, it just disappears. I know it's probably repressed trauma I need to work through but I don't know how. It's like I've repressed it so much that I'm unaware of it until it's crushing me and then once it's gone, it's gone. I can't work on it cause I can't normally recognize it. Is this normal?

4,Please rethink the advice you give here!,"I understand the importance of validating the pain that other people have faced in this community. I really do. But that can be done without spreading misinformation.

Not everyone who has experienced a traumatic event will develop PTSD! 

You do not need to experience symptoms directly after the event. In other words, delayed onset is possible. 

If you have experienced a traumatic event, give yourself time to heal. It‚Äôs normal to ruminate about past experiences. You may suffer from grief, depressive symptoms, anxiety and/or anger afterwards, and that‚Äôs okay! 

PTSD is a mental illness/psychiatric disorder. It has its own specific set of symptoms, and it does not only describe adverse feelings after experiencing trauma. 

PLEASE quit telling people that they probably have PTSD when they haven‚Äôt given any information to indicate that. I understand that a lot of you are simply trying to validate others, but it can be *harmful*! If a person makes a post describing that they have just experienced something awful, they‚Äôre feeling stressed, overwhelmed, depressed, etc as a result, do not jump to conclusions. 

Saying ‚ÄúYep, you could definitely have PTSD‚Äù may sound synonymous with ‚Äúwow, that‚Äôs very traumatic. I hear you and your pain is valid,‚Äù but what you‚Äôre really saying is: ‚ÄúWow, you went through a very traumatic event and it sounds like you‚Äôve developed a mental disorder too.‚Äù *It is not always comforting!!* 

Truth be told, none of us are qualified to suggest diagnoses to others. None of us are qualified to tell someone if their trauma could or will develop into PTSD. Offer support, not psychiatric advice. It‚Äôs misleading and can be potentially harmful to a person who is already in a vulnerable state.",sk2zw7,139,0.99,22,2022-02-04 03:29:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/sk2zw7/please_rethink_the_advice_you_give_here/,False,False,2022,2

8,I don't know why I keep getting assaulted.,"Ok, I thought it might be good to get it all out somewhere. **TRIGGER WARNING TRIGGER WARNING This is really detailed, with some descriptions of abuse.** Please don't read if it will trigger you. I'm really sorry if it makes you uncomfortable.

&#x200B;

First, sometime before 5 I was repeatedly sexually abused/assaulted. I don't know what actually happened, I don't remember any of it. I just know that by the time I was 5 I had knowledge of what porn is and what sex toys are/how to use them, and I have memories of me asking my friends if they knew what grown men looked like naked. The only reason I know anything happened for sure is due to another situation I'll explain later on.

&#x200B;

When I was 6, my friend started doing things to me like looking up my skirt and trying to stick her hands in my underwear, to the point of chasing me into rooms when I would try to run away from her. I would have to block myself in closets and bathroom stalls and scream at the top of my lungs to get her to go away. I feel bad now because I know that she was probably being abused at home, but idk it scared me at the time.

&#x200B;

From the time I was little to until I was about 9, I couldn't go to any sort of family reunion without get sexually harassed/abused. It was mostly by older, distant relatives who I didn't know very well, but there was always something happening to me (though it never really went as far as full-blown rape or even really assault). I would tell my mom, sometimes in tears, and she would just brush it off as them making me (an already squeamish, shy girl) uncomfortable when they would literally be touching me or flashing me or sticking their crotches in my face. It was disgusting. My narc uncle also groomed me and got me to touch him sexually when I was about 9-10.

&#x200B;

On a trip my family took to a campground when I was almost 7, I kept following this group of older boys (about 9-12) around. I thought they were cool and they mostly took me under their wing, until one day three of them and I were looking for frogs in the forest and they assaulted me. The only way I got them to stop was by peeing myself, which got on their hands. It made me feel proud then for defending myself but grossed out and humiliated as I got older.

&#x200B;

When I was 10, I was groomed online by someone whose real age I still don't know (first they said they were 11, then 16, then idk). They would pressure me into sending them sexual things and acting out scenarios with them through text and this online game we met on (not gonna say the actual name cuz it's embarrassing). The scenarios would involve sexual assault and pedophilia and made me uncomfortable but they would just keep asking and saying they would report me until I did. Finally I broke it off and they threatened to doxx me. They sent me my own ip address over and over before I blocked them.

&#x200B;

When I was 11-12, I made friends with this kid in my class. I felt bad for him because nobody else would be his friend, though now I can see that was for a good reason. He had an IEP due to his Conduct Disorder (and was held back two years) so he got a pass out of gym and got the teacher to let me skip gym as well to ""study"" with him. For some reason, we would be unsupervised for long periods at a time (I think because the school thought it would be fine if I was there since I was a good student), and during those times he would repeatedly harass me and threaten me.

He would make me play computer and board games where he would make his character rape my character, he would try to force me to touch him sexually and he would touch me over my underwear/clothes. The kid would also follow me around and try to get me to have sex with him, whispering in my ear and disrespecting my personal space even in front of all my friends. He spread rumours that we were having sex and told me to just get it over with since everybody thought so already. He also said that none of the teachers would believe me if I told them what was going on because he was technically disabled. I'm almost certain now that the kid was some sort of psychopath.

&#x200B;

I'm 15 now. I just want to be okay. This isn't even all of it, there are more instances of me being harassed. I live in a big city so I've been stalked/followed, I've had creepy encounters on the street, I've been groped in passing. I also got a job this past summer and was harassed by my boss at the job.

All of these instances of abuse have really affected the way I see my body (I'm completely afraid of/repulsed by it lol), my ability to form new relationships, and just the way I see the world/other people. I'm also terrified of most men.

3,My husband shot himself right next to me.,"Me (28F) and my husband (30M) have been together since we were teenagers. We have two kids together a 4yo and a 2yo, both boys. For the most part, our relationship was great. We were each other‚Äôs first everything. First kiss, first relationship, etc. and I had noticed that this did make us extremely codependent on the other over time. Me and my husband both struggle with mental health problems. My husband more so than me. 

We got married after being together for 6 years and went right into having children. After we had our first son, things started getting really difficult. My husbands mental health began to spiral. The financial burden became fully his because couldn‚Äôt work due to health complications during my pregnancy. We had also decided that it would be more smart for us financially if I stayed home with our son, rather than getting a babysitter. 

Once our oldest became about two years old, I did go back to work to help relieve some stress and we hired my little sister to help with the kids. It helped a lot financially but my husband pretty much checked out mentally with things involving our marriage and being a parent. During the next (roughly) 3 years and one more child later, our relationship became fully platonic. This is something that deeply bothered me and I felt that we needed to fix because we both deserved better. I told my husband about how I was feeling several times and that I wanted to go to marriage counseling but he was firm on not going because he felt they would recommend separation. Which eventually lead to me asking for a separation because I had become so unhappy. 

We had been separated for a couple of weeks and the amount of peace I felt really made me realize that I wanted a divorce. So I told my husband how I was feeling. This did not go very well. He wasn‚Äôt so much angry, as just giving off a very uncomfortable vibe. I decided to take a bath and try to relax from all of the stress, and that is when I received the text. 

It was a suicide text. And he told me that if he couldn‚Äôt be with me that life was not worth living. The time stamp was two minutes earlier so I knew I needed to hurry to get to my bedroom where he had locked himself in. 

I jumped out of the bath, grabbed a towel, tried to open our bedroom door but it was locked (I didn‚Äôt realize he had locked himself is there at this point). So I ran to the kitchen, grabbed a butter knife and slide it into the door frame to unlock the door. Once I got into the room, my two year old had followed me and I didn‚Äôt know this because I was focused on helping my husband. He had locked himself in our master bathroom and I couldn‚Äôt get the door open. 

I was shaking the handle, screaming for him, asking what he was doing. He didn‚Äôt answer. I continued to shake the handle and I felt him hold it. And then I heard A loud pop and I heard his body hit the floor. Nothing but a full on wail came out of me. With my two year old right there. I immediately called 911 and grabbed my babies and my sister (she lives with us and heard this from the kitchen) and we waited on the porch, screaming and crying while the police came. 

My husband survived. He lost his right eye and most of his tongue. We do not know what exactly his quality of life will be. But I am grateful he survived. 

I‚Äôm also incredibly traumatized. My two year old screams all of the time now too. I have so many emotions it‚Äôs hard to process. I don‚Äôt understand how he could just leave me with all of this. Knowing that I would have to grieve and still parent my kids, and still have to figure out how to do all of this while overcoming all of this trauma that he put me through. 

A lot of my family doesn‚Äôt seem to understand. They think that because we had been together for so long that we need to try to work this out. But now I am terrified of him and my decision to get a divorce just feels more solidified. I want no romantic relationship with him. I have nightmares every night. I have to live in the house where my husband shot himself three feet away from me. And I feel like everyone thinks I‚Äôm this bitch who is abandoning my husband when he needs me the most. 

I just don‚Äôt know  where to begin with the healing process. I was given a few resources for counseling but I can‚Äôt bring myself to call yet. I guess I just wanted to share my story on here as a way to relieve from sort of stress.

EDIT: Wow. Thank you all so much. The amount of support I am getting from all of you is incredible. My feelings feel validated and that helps me so much more than I can even describe. I am dealing with immense guilt, anger, depression, all while trying to be a good mom to my babies and trying to survive living in this house where I‚Äôm reminded of the entire ordeal every day. I made an appointment for trauma counseling next week. Just talking to the counselor on the phone was already helpful because I felt validation. So I am hoping this is a step in the right direction. Last night was especially hard and I cried for several hours straight just dealing with all of the pain and emotions and confusion. I am going to start the process in going forward with a divorce because like many of you have stated, my instincts are telling me to run.

4,I need to talk about my son.,"NSFW- Child loss & Domestic Violence




When I was 15 I was in a horrible relationship. We're talking daily violence and essentially 4 years of torture both physical and mental. He was 3 years older than me, he was twice my size and I was completely powerless. 

By the time I was 17 I was completely isolated from everyone I love and utterly reliant on him and when I fell pregnant it was just another excuse for him to control every little thing about my life. He had expressed early on that he had no interest in the baby and did not want to be a father. I missed the majority of my prenatal appointments and had to lie to get to any of them, which was an incredibly risky business. 

A few times I took beatings and was convinced I'd lose my baby because they were always focused around my stomach. But my little one held on and was the only thing getting me through it all. I of course wanted to leave but I had nothing and no one, my family and friends had no idea I was even pregnant. 

When I was 37.5 weeks pregnant he drove me towards his work- his work bordered a massive wooded area/conservation park- and when we got to the most secluded part he pushed me out of the car and kicked and kicked and kicked. Every blow landed on my stomach, I tried to protect my baby, not caring how much he hurt me, but eventually I was in a state of semi consciousness and I couldn't control my body anymore. I cannot describe the pain. Like someone had ripped every single one of my organs out one by one, covered them in acid and put them back in. He walked away from me, got back in the car and drove off. That picture of the car driving away, of laying in the road in more pain than I've ever felt is what haunts my nightmares and flashes in front of my eyes every single day. 

I don't remember much after that. An older couple, in their 60s I think found me and took me to the hospital- I'm told they had no phone signal to call for an ambulance. The next thing I remember is waking up, feeling empty. I knew my baby wasn't there anymore but I had no idea where they were. I was frantic, asking where my baby was, if they were alive. I was so upset I'd pulled out all of my IVs and was trying to get out of bed. A doctor came in and told me that my placenta had ruptured, my baby was alive, but he'd been without oxygen for such a long time they didn't expect him to live through the night. 

I was 17 years old, alone having just had major surgery and now been told my child would likely die. The only thing getting me through and he'd be gone too. They brought him in, this tiny little thing covered in wires and tubes. I'd barely even acknowledged the doctor when he told me that my baby was a little boy. None of it was how it was meant to be, but he was here and he was mine and I promised myself I'd do everything possible to help him and protect him.

Alfie wasn't even on my shortlist of names but when the nurse asked me if I had a name for him, it's what came out without hesitation, it felt right. That nurse sat with me for hours, even after her shift ended so I wasn't alone. We are still friends to this day. I was allowed to hold him with the help of some pillows so I didn't rip my stitches and he wrapped his tiny hand around my finger. The doctor came back regularly to check on him and it was clear even to me that he was deteriorating. I asked them to stop my pain medication so I could remember him more clearly, so I wouldn't forget a single second. They were reluctant but agreed and I held my son for 44 hours and 13 minutes until he took his final breath. 

I'm sure I was screaming, but all I could hear was my ears ringing and I just held him and cried for hours, until they told me they had to take him away. I've never known emptiness like it. My arms were empty, my heart was empty and my stomach was empty. It still feels like someone reached their first into my chest and ripped out my heart, even 8 years later. 

Most of my family and friends still don't even know about Alfie. I can't talk about him out loud. I can't answer their questions and watch their hearts break as well as my own. My amazing best friend knows as does my SO and they're both incredible when the world gets too much. 

Alfie's father is in prison, for the things he did to me and subsequently his now ex-wife and going to court was the hardest thing I've ever done. But I did it for my son, to get him justice, even though it will never bring him back to me. 

If you're still reading, thank you. I'm glad you met Alfie with me. He was born at 11:11 in the morning. So if you happen to catch it on the clock, make a wish on us both.

5,YOU CANNOT ASK FOR A DIAGNOSIS.,"I know recently the Mods have put up an extra line at the top of the subreddit, but if you are on the mobile app you don‚Äôt actually see this unless you expand the top text.

This subreddit is not a place to ask for a diagnosis and nor is it the place to give it.

We are open to giving advice on HOW to get a diagnosis, or how to deal with panic attacks, anxiety, sleep etc.

I have reported every single post I have seen asking for a diagnosis and I don‚Äôt think unfortunately this is enough as I see them more and more often. 

It needs to be blindly obvious that this is not allowed here, it is encouraging online diagnosis‚Äô from non-professional and non-trained.

We want people to get a medical professional to diagnose them, for their own health and safety and benefit. 

We will never not offer help, this is exactly what this subreddit is for, we want to help. 

We cannot however diagnose.

Edit: I have now put up a separate post asking those who have useful resources or advice on how people can get professional help or a diagnosis can go. If you do have advice or a helpful organisation please feel free to share it there. Please note as per the rules no medical advice (medication etc). Resources or organisations that offer free consults/advice are very very welcome.",te4wyn,178,0.98,92,2022-03-14 18:58:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/te4wyn/you_cannot_ask_for_a_diagnosis/,False,False,2022,3

7,"Coworker keeps jump scaring me, I‚Äôm going to set a boundary today","I‚Äôve been mostly a lurker on this sub but I wanted to share this with you guys because I know you ‚Äúget it‚Äù. 

I have a coworker who for the past few weeks has realized I‚Äôm very jumpy and easily startled, so he‚Äôs been scaring me multiple times a day. Jumping out from behind hiding spots and making a big noise, suddenly yelling or clapping behind me when I‚Äôm focusing on something. Because my reactions are funny to him, I jump, yelp, make weird noises, shrink down and cover my head. I know he doesn‚Äôt mean it maliciously, he‚Äôs just being playful and doesn‚Äôt know my past and how being scared like that affects me harder than the average person. But it‚Äôs extremely frustrating. If I saw someone reacting the way I am, I would immediately stop. 

I‚Äôve put a lot of work into recovery with therapy, a lot for me has improved, but my body still goes from 0-100 when someone scared me like that. That fight or flight mode rages, heart racing, quick heavy breath, tense muscles, flashes of bad memories. So far, I‚Äôve been able to manage and act ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, but I‚Äôm afraid that he‚Äôs going to catch me in the wrong moment, and I‚Äôll burst out crying or even instinctively go to hit him or something.

Standing up for myself is a huge challenge. In the trauma I went through I very much reverted into fawn mode to survive, being as small as quiet as possible, doing whatever I needed to do to manage abusers‚Äô moods to try and keep myself safe. But I know I don‚Äôt *have* to do that anymore, I am safe now, it‚Äôs safe to stand up for myself. When I see my coworker today, I‚Äôm going to take him aside and tell him ‚ÄúI know you haven‚Äôt meant any harm by scaring me, I know it seems like a joke and I haven‚Äôt said anything, but I need you to stop doing it. I have PTSD, and being scared like that constantly is a lot more harmful and intense for me than the average person.‚Äù
Just something like that. I‚Äôm nervous to say it, but I think he‚Äôll be understanding.


EDIT- update

Hi guys, I did it and it thankfully went pretty smooth. I kept it simple and didn‚Äôt straight up say I have PTSD- basically just told him it is causing me stress and that I need him to stop. He was very apologetic (it felt genuine) and said he would stop, acted kind of awkward and avoidant for the rest of the shift but I expected that. I think he will definitely listen and stop, and if he doesn‚Äôt, I can take it to my boss and HR. But I have a good feeling from how things went and felt that it will be ok and won‚Äôt come to that.

I really appreciate all the support and advice today on this post, it helped give me the strength to stand up for myself and actually say something. That‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been very difficult in my life so being able to do that was a big victory for me- I know so many of you here understand that. It makes me sad that so many of you have dealt with situations like this in the workplace too. It  sucks so much to deal with, and I send love to anyone currently having to deal with a coworker like that.

This is a really special community here and I‚Äôm thankful to have found it. You guys helped me a lot today.

8,what is something that you wish people w/o PTSD would understand?,"Hey all, I hope this post is allowed as I don't have PTSD... My closest friend, however, does. They have explained to me what PTSD is like but they often feel as though I don't really understand their struggle - and I guess I can't 100% understand what I don't suffer from - so, my question is... What do you wish people would understand about it? I'm talking about the more 'subtle', so to speak, things... For instance I do understand that certain topics are triggering, that touch can be uncomfortable, that one can be easily startled and so on... I guess, which things that aren't easy and obvious to understand.

EDITED TO ADD: I'm so surprised that this got so much attention, I read everything and I'm so grateful for each and every reply I got, I wish you all nothing but the best in life - I know that it's a chronic condition and that it never goes away, but I hope that the burden and the pain you all carry won't always feel as heavy and unbearable (I also hope that this won't sound wrong and insensitive, I'm not the best with words).

I've used their online counseling before cause it's easier to write than to talk, and because I was unsure if they even deal with the kind of violence I've experienced. The counselor said they do, and I should contact the local team for in depth cooperation. 


Turns out, they don't. I've experienced the wrong kind of crime, the wrong kind of violence and there is no support system for me. Their website says that they don't compare or judge between victims of different crimes and support everyone. They fucking need to add a disclaimer with the exceptions.

14,Can you see it in peoples eyes?,"I've been watching this brilliant series on YouTube recently called soft white under belly. Its interviews with people from all walks who have had difficult lives, addicts, gangsters, veterans, mobsters, sex workers etc most are traumatized and I suspect many have ptsd. It really helps me see things from others perspective and draw from their strengths, warning it can be quite intense and sad.

Anyways, one thing I've noticed is many of the people have this look in their eyes. They're intense, piercing but somewhat distant. It's like they contain pain, anger, resilience, strength, sincerity, longing and strange knowledge all at once. They look almost other worldly, beautiful and a little scary.

I see the same things in my eyes at times and wonder if this pushes 'normal' people away, has anyone else noticed a similar thing?

16,Does anyone else struggles to literally speak?,"Not sure if this needs a TW so if it does please tell me (put the NSFW tag just in case)

Okay so I (18F)must warn you I'm not diagnosed. I do want to go to the psychologist but this and the fact I'm not sure if I have enough money are the reason I haven't done anything yet.

Moving on, I often struggle with talking about my feelings and things that trigger me. My throat literally closes and sometimes (thankfully it doesn't happen often) I almost suffocate. I have a normal life and my happy moments, but I just don't know how to manage the bad ones. This can happen in front of other people but mostly I get so terrified of talking about it that I just involuntarily force myself to look better while alone it would easily evolve to a panic attack.

I swear to god I don't know what's happening to me, I just feel so terrified of talking that I avoid it at all costs. I even considered learning sign language to communicate to a therapist but I realized I'd be uncomfortable in their presence as well because just the idea of being in the same room as the other person when talking about these things feels repulsive. I don't like to feel their eyes over me or to feel strong (negative) emotions in the presence of others.

This has been happening for years and I often run from my family and from any form of kindness, be it from my mom or a friend because it feels suffocating and scary.
