0,Request: i regret ever speaking up,"(F 20) about a month or so ago i told my mom about my ed bulimia, ever since then she wont stop mentioning in front of my friends or her friends or even just at home in like a loud manner when my sister and father are there, everytime she sees me eating she goes ""thats why you throw up so much, stop eating in such large quantity"" or she goes ""ik how you think, you eat alot and then you feel guilty so you throw up, stop eating alot in the first place"" she does it when ever she sees me next to food or eating or just having just finished it, or she makes stupid senseless jokes about it infront of people WHO SHOULD NOT KNOW ABOUT IT. it makes me regret ever telling her about it when i broke down before and blurted it out, it makes me feel like i dont want to ever eat infront of her or eat in general, i dont restrict but this is getting on my nerves and i hate it i hate it i hate it. she doesn't understand and she never will.",fogdib,305,1.0,17,2020-03-25 00:09:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/fogdib/request_i_regret_ever_speaking_up/,False,False,2020,3
1,Request: Netflix’s Cheer Trigger Warning,Hello! I just wanted to post saying if anyone with and ED is interested in watching Cheer on Netflix it was very triggering for me.

2,Request: Binging Behaviors and Coronavirus,"Needless to say, there have been some...developments this week, and unfortunately, the coronavirus has food implications!

For those of us who struggle with snacking, portion control, and binging behavior...how have you balanced this with the instinct/logic to stock up on food re: coronavirus? This one is really frustrating for me. I usually don’t purchase snacks or extra food to keep in the house because I end up eating it all or binging at some point. But now that everyone where I live (NYC) is stocking up on food in preparation for self quarantine, I don’t know what to do. Half of me is like “BUY THE FOOD. SURVIVAL FIRST.” The other side of me is like, “You won’t actually run out of food, people are panicking. Just continue as normal.” Thoughts on what to do?

3,Request: Worried about how self-quarantining will affect my disordered eating,"I have been making progress in recovering from my ED over the past few months, but things start to get more difficult when I spend long periods of time at home, around lots of food. I start stressing more about when/what I am eating and it’s hard to focus on other things. 

Now that we’re being encouraged to spend more and more time at home, I am getting really anxious about being at home for most of my day.  I feel as though I won’t be able to control myself around all this food. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to stay calm when surrounded by food, or tips to distract/comfort myself when it’s all I can seem to think about?",fl3we2,90,0.99,22,2020-03-19 04:27:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/fl3we2/request_worried_about_how_selfquarantining_will/,False,False,2020,3
4,Request: Mental hunger vs eating out of boredom?,"I’m so confused about when to eat. I follow a lot of recovery accounts that support going the “all in” route where you honor your physical and mental hunger. Basically, if you’re thinking about food, it’s a sign to eat. 
Then there’s also the whole mindfulness, asking yourself if you’re actually hungry thing. 
I’ve done the “all in” thing off and on. I’ve never really had extreme physical hunger, just mental. I’ll do it usually a month or two but then it sort of peters out? I’ll be committed in the beginning but then I start wondering if it’s actually mental hunger or if I’m just bored. If I wasn’t trying to pay attention to whether or not I was thinking about food, would I be thinking about it so much? My mom, who doesn’t have an ED, will be like “oh I’ve eaten so many snacks, I need to stop now,” so I start wondering if it’s normal to think about having more but not do it. 
I know who to ask if I want the eat everything you think about answer, and I know who would give me the listen for your hunger cues answer. I guess I’m just looking for additional opinions?

5,Request: How to stop the urge to binge during quarantine,"Due to several unfortunate circumstances, I'm currently staying at home with my parents and sister until further notice. All of us work from home, sis has online school so there's basically very little privacy. This whole situation + the inability to go out shopping without a good excuse and find fast food in a small town makes me very anxious, which just amplifies my urge to binge eat and drink.

6,A subreddit for transgender people with an ED.,"Hi all! 

I noticed a lot of transgender individuals posting in the main ed subs. As a trans man myself, i felt like it would be beneficial to have another safe space for us all within the reddit ED community.

I created r/transED to accomplish just that. It will be a strictly pro-recovery environment for trans people to discuss and vent about their struggles with disordered eating, especially in relation to their gender dysphoria.

I really hope this sub is able to grow and blossom! Thank you to everyone who joins.

7,Request: boyfriend broke up with me two weeks after i left residential treatment,"three weeks ago i got out of residential treatment (i was there for four months). i was doing so well in recovery at home and feeling really confident in my ability to recover. then my boyfriend who i was with for two years broke up with me five days ago. 

it feels like a punishment from anorexia. it feels like it’s punishing me for getting rid of it and caring about myself. i feel so much guilt for taking care of myself and not paying enough attention to the relationship. it feels like him falling out of love with me is all my fault. plus i gained weight through weight restoration and i can’t help but think he thinks i’m fat, ugly, and disgusting now. 

this just makes me want to go backwards and relapse :( i know it’s a bad idea because i did so much hard work, but it’s so tempting to go back to my old habits.

my therapist told me something that was helpful: that i’ve improved myself and am healthy now and he’s missing out on the real me. but at the same time, i just wish that wasn’t true and i wish i didn’t have to do this without him, he was my best friend. :(

8,Request: Dealing with comments on your eating,"I bring my lunch with me to work every day, and it’s always rice and vegetables.

 It’s bland and flavorless, and it’s all I’ll allow myself to eat. It’s almost always my only ‘meal’ of the day. And without a doubt, my coworkers always comment/joke about my lunch, and it’s very triggering.

They will ask what else I eat, or where I get my nutrition and I obviously have to lie. I hate it so much, it makes me not want to bring a lunch at all, but I know that’ll bring up more questions. How do you deal with people being invasive and commenting on your ED?

9,Request: how can I cope with BED while quarantined,"I’ve been having more binging sessions because I’m at home all the time. I’ve also been snacking a lot out of boredom but also stress. It doesn’t help that we have extra food at home. 

It’s not good because whenever I go shopping, there’s not a lot of food left at the grocery stores. I feel bad because we need to make whatever we have last. Just so that we don’t make too many trips to the store. 

I can’t seem to stop even though I feel disgusted with myself and guilty but I keep doing the same thing the next day. Food is constantly on my mind.

10,Request: Came out to my partner and I feel like I made a mistake,"I'm unsure of what to do. I (F24) finally told my bf (M27) of 2 years about my ED of 7 years now. He's my best friend who's so supportive and makes me feel like so loved. We moved in together after a year of doing long distance. I never thought I would tell him about my little secret, I thought it was something I could keep him in the dark about until it eventually went away.

 I get stuck in a pattern: Eat moderate amount of calories a day, lift at the gym 4x a week, don't eat beyond 7pm, and use meds to aid in appetite suppressant. And then there will be one day in the week where I will splurge on to a somewhat normal amount of calories and then try to compensate with restricting and vigorously exercising.
My family have always had their suspicions about my eating patterns but those discussions never got anywhere productive. My childhood best friend is the one I confide in for when I'm especially struggling or when I was successfully able to ""forgive myself"" for overeating.

 Back to my boyfriend, ever since he saw me faint infront of his eyes, he's made more comments geared towards eating, like ""you should eat dinner, sweetie,"" and ""let's fatten you up"".

 But then one night two weeks ago when we got fast food together on the way home from clubbing he said ""This is the first time we got fast food together"" and added ""you eat less than you did before, you're smaller than when we first met"". In the moment, my tipsy self just word vomited ""I've been struggling with an eating disorder for a long time."" I told him for how long and who knew, and all he could say was ""and you waited this long to tell me?""....we never talked about it since, and kinda just carried on like I never told him. I thought I would feel better, but I feel more anxious. 

Idk what he's thinking or if he sees me differently. Anyone else come out to someone and somewhat regret telling them?",fovhb9,63,0.97,10,2020-03-25 18:33:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/fovhb9/request_came_out_to_my_partner_and_i_feel_like_i/,False,False,2020,3

12,Request: My SO won't accept our break up for my Recovery.,"I recently shared how my boyfriend had told me I had gained weight and how that has significantly contributed to a relapse in my recovery. Very fortunate to have a great therapist & friends around me - however after thinking through my circumstances decided to call it off with this guy & focus all my energy on to my self & my recovery - for the first time ever, woo! 

BUT - the conversation was so heavy and manipulative. He did everything in his power to make me feel like I'm not stable and it's a ""phase I'm going through"". He said things like -


• ""if you choose to leave me I won't stick around, you'll never see me again and I will not be there to support you""

• ""right now you're having a bad time but when you recover a little more you'll see that breaking up isn't what you want right now""

• ""I thought you loved me, if you did you wouldn't be leaving me right now""

• ""give me reasons as to why you cannot recover healthily and have me by your side supporting you?""

• ""the least you can do is take some time to talk to a friend about this very big decision""

• ""this is not the person I grew to love , you're not acting yourself so I think you should go away and think about this""

• ""this is so unfair and cold of you to break up with me after what we have built these last few months""

• ""does this not even upset you?""

• ""did your therapist tell you to do this?""


The chat was for 3 hours. It was exhausting, all on this kinda level. So heavy. Basically trying to convince me that I need him, it's a phase and that I need to provide reasons as to why I cannot be with him and be in therapy too. 

Is Recovery not a valid enough reason to choose to be single? Or am I actually being a cold person like he says? Damn",fgbgxm,63,1.0,20,2020-03-10 10:02:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/fgbgxm/request_my_so_wont_accept_our_break_up_for_my/,False,False,2020,3

There is this one food that always turns you into a ravenous monster, almost as if you were physically addicted to it. For me that's milk chocolate. If it's any other type of chocolate or candy I often don't even end up binging but milk chocolate is a blessing and curse to me at the same time.

Now, the obvious answer would be to never touch my favorite chocolate brand ever again but that would be a really sad life.

14,Eating Disorder Discord server is live!,"Hello friends,



The Eating Disorder discord server is live. At least 10 of you people wanted the Discord server and since I'm excited to create one too I went ahead and made one.

How will we moderate Discord?

* There's an automatic check for numbers in combination with trigger words. Things such as ""I lost 5 KG"", ""I ate 400 calories"" will AUTOMATICALLY be removed once posted. 
* You, the people using the server, have the ability to remove comments in case they DO NOT automatically get removed by the bot. Simply add a reaction and if the threshold is reached then the message will be removed. (Currently it's set to 3 reactions).
* Some other handy commands that you can check out on the server

I've listened to the feedback from the survey ([this one](https://forms.gle/nTBEG7Xvbd6C73ZG9)) and currently there's NO option for voice chat as it is in fact very hard to moderate.

Secondly, I've only set up some basic channels and ideas. All the rest should be community driven. 

Lastly for those who want to join to talk:

#[CLICK ME](https://discord.gg/ShRD55t)

Please give feedback to /u/Ghordrin if you want to add/change things.

15,Inspiration: Recovery is possible!,"Hey all - I've been lurking this site for the past few years but never posted. Figured I'd spread some positivism today.

I'm a 37 female and I've been in recovery for over 13 years now. I started restricting when I was 12 years and didn't fully into a recovered state until I was 22/23 and decided to go back to college full-time. I will say I was very good at my eating disorder that I was inpatient 9 times in 7 different centers with a feeding tube twice. If I can get better - so can you.

Some things that helped me in recovery: 

1. Getting out of my old ED environment. This meant moving out of my mom's house into the dorms and making new friends.

2. Social Interaction - I could not do my behaviors if I was isolating. So I ate with friends and even just out in public as much as possible.

3. Having a goal outside of my ED. I went back to college so I had classes and projects to focus on rather than meals and numbers.

4. STAYING ON MY MEAL PLAN. I did this for the first few years. Whatever I had to do to get it in - I did it. It sucked. I did not like it for awhile then it was just normal and my anxiety became less and less. I can say my anxiety around food is zero now.

5. Giving myself GRACE. This does not go away over night. It will suck some days. Some days will feel like a gift. Your body will change but that is what it takes for your mind to change!

I hope this helps someone whether its a loved one or a person struggling. Please talk to people in your life about what is going on. You are not alone regardless of situation.",fhk7en,61,0.98,6,2020-03-12 17:39:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/fhk7en/inspiration_recovery_is_possible/,False,False,2020,3
16,Request: My therapist found out that I haven’t eating in a week and wants me to get an IV,"I’ve being treated for anorexia since September and was making good progress for a while but snapped back into it over the last week and stopped eating entirely. My therapist found out that I’ve only really consumed calories from the almond milk that goes in my coffee which isn’t very much. She asked me to go to the emergency room or an urgent care and get an IV to refeed, which I didn’t really know was a thing or what that really entails. She offered to call ahead of time and give direction so I didn’t have to, but that almost sounds worse than just doing it myself. 

That being said, I told her I would consider both options, but I have a couple of concerns.

I feel like I’m wasting the nurses and doctors time by going in for a problem that I’m creating for myself and feel like I would be treated accordingly by the staff. 

I also don’t know what this kind of process looks like if I do go through with it.

17,Request: Eating feels like a chore,"here is what I want to post:
I think I have an eating disorder. I eat a recommended **** calories a day (according to my BMI), eat three meals a day and snack, and exercise a normal amount. But everyday it is a struggle mentally. If I eat my total calories, I hate myself, feel shame and weak for not having been able to keep it lower. If I keep it lower, I give into some more food to satisfy my hunger. The people around me seem to have smaller appetites than me and are able to eat less, while still wanting less naturally. 
Although I tell my closest friends and boyfriend about my insecurities, I never let them know how mentally terrible and hard it is. They wouldn't get it anyways, because to them it seems like I eat normally and more, like when I get ice cream after lunch or buy something at my school snack bar. It's all just mentalI guess, the way I think about every bite of the croissant I'm eating or try to count the calories in the soup, but end up zoning out because It's impossible to estimate the calories in this soup. 
I don't want to get help because I don't even think it's a big enough deal, or that it would do anything. Also, I just want to lose weight. If I get help, I'm scared my weight loss will stop and I'l just hate myself for not doing anything about it.

19,"Request: Do you ever really feel ""recovered"" from an eating disorder?","hi all, i hope this is the right place to ask this. i am going to try to not be super specific to not be triggering.

i was in a treatment centre for anorexia from the age of 12 to about 15. i convinced the treatment centre i was at i was better and didn't need any more therapy. i was 100% lying, but i hated the centre so much and i had panic attacks every time i had to go.

over the next couple years, i still struggled a lot with my body image but i became weight-restored. my family and friends all stopped worrying about me, i even went through a stint in grade 11 where i gained a lot of weight. i was horrified when i went to the doctor and saw the number and lost the weight through calorie counting and exercising a lot.

the thing is throughout this whole time, i still felt very similarly to how i felt when i was younger and struggling. in terms of body-image, guilt, restrictive patterns, etc.

i am now 20, and this past year was a tough one. i was eating in an extreme deficit, back on my ed twitter account, taking constant bodycheck photos, etc. i lost weight and the people in my life noticed. but i felt like a fraud, like even though i was doing restrictive behaviours i felt like my illness wasnt valid and i was just going through a phase or something.

i am trying to take care of myself now and not over-restrict to lose weight. but it's very hard for me to not slip into my old ways of restriction. 

i guess i am  confused about what recovery means. when you are fully and legitmately recovered, do you never get these feelings again? does my relapse mean that i was never recovered in the first place? i wish i could understand these feelings, i am so frustrated at hating my body and myself so much that this is how i treat myself.

She had and eating disorders prior to use being together and was recovered the time we started dating. Around 9 months ago however it recurred and things got gradually worse due to stress at work. She has been off work now around 6 months and is in treatment. Progress has been slow with some positive steps and some struggles but broadly things were stable or so I thought.

3 weeks ago she said she was having doubts about our relationship and her attraction to me. Then after a few days se arranged to meet me insisting I was somewhere around friends or family.

She then read me a letter about how she loved me but was no longer in love with me and no longer wanted to get married and have children with me. She said her feelings had been real and they had been the best 4 years of her life but I deserved someone who wasn't having doubts and declined when I offered her more time to think or a month break to think about such a big decision. I questioned whether she thought our our relationship has been a good thing and she said I had been an amazing support and said I should work on a support line one day although I probably wouldn't feel like it now. 

She had said things before along the lines of I deserved better than her and that she thinks she tricked me when we met into thinking she was normal. I insisted that I loved her and nobody is without their problems. In spite of her illness we have always had a good time when we are together.

I showed her cards she had written to me about how happy she was and us spending our future together to try to remind her of who she was but she said that she had changed. When asked if she had been having doubts for a while she said no, but she just knew that she needed to be on her own right now.

She did all she could to make things final, and changed her social media pictures on that day and insisted I tell my family. She said I should not contact her as it would be too hard for me and so I can heal and go through the stages then she would love to have me as a friend. She told me not to wait for her.

I couldn't get through to her when I said she was trying to push me away, I have read similar accounts online and about people with ED being consumed by guilt of what they are putting their partner through. I did tell her all the good times outweighed the difficult times but I couldn't get through and her mind was made up.

I have given it two weeks since then and not been in touch with her. Have heard a little from her family and it seems her behaviour is very erratic at the moment, like she is a different person and she has also barely been I touch with her sister who she is normally very close with. Her mum and friends have been with her though so I hope she is okay.

I am unsure where things stand for us now and whether she will regret this decision sooner or later. I really love this girl and want our relationship to work but I would have to be sure this couldn't happen again as this break up has been heartbreaking for me.

Would appreciate any advice, as much as I want to contact her I feel like this would be a bad move if the ED voice is still very strongly controlling her and I don't know if I could get through to her if it is.",f6wf3h,51,0.96,8,2020-02-20 17:28:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/f6wf3h/request_girlfriend_with_ed_broke_up_with_me/,False,False,2020,2
25,Request: 25F and I feel too old for this,"I've struggled with an ED for over a decade, and was diagnosed with EDNOS years back. In the past two years, I had managed to get a handle on my restrictive behavior and get back to a healthy weight, although I never really considered myself ""in recovery"" for whatever reason, I guess because since I started seeing a new therapist a while back I've never brought up my ED. I just really don't like talking about it. I've never wanted to fully let go of the voice in my head, even during the two year time period I worked to ignore it. 
I fell extremely ill over the new year, and ended up dropping a lot of weight extremely quickly. I've since recovered from the illness, but the quick weight loss has caused me to fall back into disordered eating. I'm frustrated with myself, but at the same time I've been continuing to fall in line with my ED and haven't even tried fighting it. 
I'm 25 years old, and I guess my whole life I figured I'd grow out of this or move on by now. I feel too old to be suffering with an ED (even though logically I know that's not true). I guess I'm just looking for reassurance that I'm not alone. Idk.

26,Request: Is something wrong with me? Do men get eating disorders?,"My mother and my female friend are concerned about me but i think I'm improving my life, I'm just trying to lose weight. I know it is maybe a little extreme but I am finally motivated to change.

I am a straight male in my 20s... never heard of someone like me getting an eating disorder ever, so it must be extremely rare and I probably don't have one.

I hate my body due to my weight (I'm obese) and 3 months ago I started a vegetable diet of a few hundred calories a day. I've now lost 60 pounds in 3 months but I'm still fat. I also did water fasting. I have developed a fear of food and I am mostly very happy about that. Mostly all I eat is fruit and vegetables and I never ever eat carbs. I tried to train myself to not want food by self harming every time I got hungry. I know that's weird but it was a good distraction. I stopped because of the comments (my arms are already scarred due to suicide attempts but new ones got questions). I exercise a lot and if i eat too much I make up for it with exercise. I exercise until I want to die for hours every day. I'm getting so much healthier and fitter even if I am overworking my muscles a bit. 

I struggle sometimes because I know I don't actually *need* to eat, it's just hunger signals/greed/habit. My body has over a hundred pounds of excess fat. As long as I get vitamins, I don't actually need food. That's why I feel guilty when I eat, I don't need it.

I'm taking amphetamine drugs to reduce hunger, I started that on the advice of a friend and I think it'll be difficult to stop them now. Happy I did it though. Looking in the mirror makes me want to die, it is so disgusting seeing all the rolls of fat and my huge stomach. I don't care what methods or how extreme it is, I just want to lose weight as quick as possible. Is that really so bad..?

I used to be thin and good looking, I dated a lot, then somehow I became an obese food addicted alcoholic shut in. I invited one of my female friends over a couple of months ago. She was shocked at my weight gain and it was incredibly embarrassing. I got drunk and tried to kiss her and she said she wasn't interested because I was so fat. The disgust in her eyes was the worst feeling.. to go from women looking at you seductively to looking at you like you're a piece of dog shit is the worst i have ever felt. I didn't eat for 3 weeks after that (water fasting). I wanted to carry on but I'm too weak and just gave in. I want to try for 6 weeks. I won't be happy until all this disgusting fat is gone from my body. 

I know my thought patterns are quite negative but overall I think it's very good that I lost weight and I'm happy with my progress. I don't think I have an eating disorder but if I do then it's a good thing. Is there anything concerning here?",faa2ke,49,0.92,22,2020-02-27 10:20:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/faa2ke/request_is_something_wrong_with_me_do_men_get/,False,False,2020,2
27,Request: Is it possible to get back to the body I had before the eating disorder began?,"Hi 

around 4 years ago I had an eating disorder where I lost weight very rapidly within the space of about 6 months but although this seems like a long time ago now and I’m at an healthy weight, my body is not the same as it was pre eating disorder and I’m more self conscious (I’m stuck at a lower weight than before it happened). I’ve been having loads of regretful thoughts lately about how I may have almost messed up my puberty and should’ve just appreciated the body that I had back then because there was nothing wrong with it. But don’t feel like I can talk to anyone because on the outside my body “looks” fine but inside my head I regret the damage done and scared it’s permanent.

So have I ruined everything forever (I.e. puberty and the body I had back then)? Does anyone have any thoughts/tips? Thank you.",fpb20v,49,0.95,20,2020-03-26 12:58:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/fpb20v/request_is_it_possible_to_get_back_to_the_body_i/,False,False,2020,3
28,Request: advice on helping a friend avoid refeeding syndorme?,"So my friend has an ed, they have been eating and sleeping very poorly recently, to the extent where they had a seizure recently at work, which they say their seizures tend to act up when they dont do those things.

 its a combo of an ed and also not having any money. anyway i just found out they havent eaten in some days (after a period of very poor/inconsistent eating). i convinced them to get something and they are going to eat now, but i am worried about things like refeeding syndrome which i have heard about. ive been trying to look it up but idk what is the best resource. i think maybe they should be being monitored, esp cause they live alone, like in a hospital or sth but they live in america and i dont think thats going to happen, they are already broke.

im gonna try encourage them to eat but idk what the warning signs of refeeding are. also they mentioned in the past how they had these bad eating habits where they would basically fast for a few days but eat on the next day but they had more weight on them then, and just idk what to do. they have been losing weight rapidly and have lost a lot of weight over recent months. they are now at around at a low body weight and i think 168cm?

 anyway if u have any tips/resources on what to avoid, what to watch out for, so i can educate myself and them that would be really helpful, thank you!!",fdrz4i,48,0.98,20,2020-03-05 07:51:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/fdrz4i/request_advice_on_helping_a_friend_avoid/,False,False,2020,3
29,Request: Does my boyfriend have an eating disorder?,"I first made this post in a relationship subreddit asking about my boyfriends unusual eating habits. I never recognised that he may have a disorder until someone commented that so I'm looking for other opinions. 

We have been together 5 months, he is 25. This has been going on the entire time.

My boyfriend is quite weird with food, I don't know what to make of it as I've never encountered something like this before.

He doesn't eat the majority of food, because they're ""unhealthy"", ""bad"" or would cause him to ""go back to his old ways"".

He is very slim and lean, he hates having body fat and a lot of his eating seems to be focused on making sure his bf % is as low as possible. However, he used to be overweight. I don't know how big he was as he has deleted all old pictures and doesn't like talking about it, but I know it made him very self conscious and he has said before that he was ""disgusting"". He gets weirdly annoyed and upset when anyone even mentions the fact that he used to be bigger. I don't think people treated him well when he was fat. 

I'll try my best to explain all his weird  routines but I will probably forget stuff. 

He is vegan and doesn't eat carbs, except on saturdays when he allows one small portion. He spends ages planning out his ""carb meal"" of the week. He weighs EVERYTHING and puts the calorie count in myfitnesspal. Obviously low carb vegan is super restrictive anyway, but he takes it even further to the point where the majority of his diet is just beans and vegetables.

Before every meal he drinks a cup of water and a cup of green tea. Before every evening meal he will also eat a bowl of plain boiled vegetables, usually broccoli or cabbage or something. I don't know why he does this, I asked him and he just said ""habit"" like okay... another thing he does is cuts everything into super tiny pieces and eats realllyyyyy slowly. In the last few days I realised he does this to suppress his appetite so he eats less. 

One time I cooked for us and he was okay with it until I showed him the box of the vegan meat we were using. It was very high in fat and he realised it had put him over his calorie allowance for the day and got really weird and upset about it, and talked about ""spiralling"". He exercised more and ate less the next day to make up for it.

We have only been out to eat together once. The only thing he could eat on the menu was a salad. He *picked out the breadcrumbs*. Like he sat there and picked out every tiny crumb before he ate a single bite. He's aware that his eating habits are weird because he said ""don't judge me"" before he did it...but I was just like ???. I'm not sure why he is so afraid of eating bread, even tiny amounts. It's like a phobia or something. 

He often says that he ""hates eating"" and wishes he didn't need to do it. I said something like ""maybe you need to eat some nicer food"" and he said something about how food is only fuel to him and eating nice food is self indulgent and unnecessary.

Is this concerning or is it normal for thin people that used to be bigger? 
He is very slim and has hardly any body fat. He has that ""paper thin skin"" look and you can see all his veins and muscles. He always has extremely cut abs. I don't think his bmi is underweight though, probably low end of healthy. He carefully tracks his body fat to make sure it is always under 8%, but he says that he is happier when it is around 5%. I think he looks a little bit gaunt and unwell sometimes, but I could be biased. He is clearly very fit as he is able to run long distances and works out every day.

I spoke to him once seriously about it, and he just said ""as long as I'm healthy, I should be able to eat what I want"" which I agree with, so I'm not really sure what I can say.

It just bothers me a bit. I wish he could be a bit more free with food and enjoy things without beating himself up about it. It's clear that eating causes him anxiety on some level, he admitted to that, but he said it's better that than be obese again.

Should I speak to him or is it none of my business? Is this an eating disorder?


Tldr; not sure if I should speak to my boyfriend about his eating habits. He doesn't allow himself to eat the vast majority of food and has weird rituals around eating. He used to be overweight and i think the anxiety is kind of focused on that. I'm concerned he may have am eating disorder.

31,"Request: Anorexia is ruining the relationship between me(26, F) and my sister(24, F)- any advice?","Hi firstly title says it all. In brief, I was hospitalised for anorexia a few years ago and after maybe 6-7 years would say I’m pretty much recovered mentally and physically - it has taken a lot of strong will and I’m proud of myself! 

I posted previously with a concern that my sister (very sporty, runner etc) was losing weight and I had noticed this and was concerned she may be developing some disordered eating habits. The responses were mainly saying that I was being hyper aware and overly obsessed with regards to eating habits (understandably) when in fact it could simply be a healthy weight loss. I accepted this may well be true and tried to ignore my concerns. 

Fast forward another few months and my sister admits to struggling with eating via text to myself(and asks for help from me!) and she is now clearly underweight and starting to look ill. I feel vindicated by this after previous responses but in all honesty, I wish I had been being a bit psycho (!) and hoped nothing was up- sadly this isn’t the case. 

I’m mainly looking for any advice on how to deal with this... my parents are trying to book a family holiday in a few months- I have just seen my sister and there is no way I can spend any length of time around her without feeling angry and hugely triggered by the whole situation. I don’t want to risk my own health when I am doing so well currently. I also don’t want to speak my mind to my sister too much as I know when I was ill, I loved people noticing I was underweight (barmy I know but that was how this mental illness manifested itself in me and I’m very wary of this. I don’t want to bring attention to her weight too much if I can help it). Secondly, any advice on how to tell my parents a holiday is off the cards without breaking my sisters confidentiality? I love her dearly and do not know how to act around her/towards her to stop this lasting 6 years like it did with me. I’m at a loss because I recognise there is nothing anyone could have said to prevent my decline all those years ago.

The hospital told my sister that my stomach was really messed up and that if I kept throwing up that I would bleed into my stomach or something.

35,Request: Handllng weight gain in recovery," 

i thought i had already been eating for recovery for like six months, but after my last doctors visit where my mom told me i supposedly had lost two pounds, i decided to try harder. i’ve been fitting extra snacks in where i can and started using oils to sauté food (big fear). the only problem is i’ve just NOW started to see the effects and i don’t like it. i can see that i’m getting chubby. i don’t know why but this part is insanely triggering for me. back when i was underweight i used to feel bad about my body; i didn’t like how i didn’t even fit into my old size at target and it made me feel horrible. at that point i knew i needed to gain weight. but now that it’s actually happening i’m seriously freaking out. every time i finish eating i wish i could go throw up but i don’t have the energy to. there are still places like my arms and my upper chest that are ugly and honey, but all of the weight is going to my thighs. nobody in school ever commented on my weight but i still liked seeing that i was skinnier than them. it seems like since i was able to start eating more, slowly giving up on my fear foods, that i’m not sick anymore, like i was never sick. it’s like i need the label “i have an eating disorder.” i don’t know why because i hate making it seem like i’m begging for attention but at the same time it’s exactly what i’m doing. i want people to look at me and be scared for me. but they’re not going to do that when i’m eating and at a healthy weight. i know how this fucked up this sounds, im sorry. i guess what i’m asking is, how do i stay motivated when i feel so close to giving up? how do i keep going when in the back of my mind i know that i’m just voluntarily making myself bigger?",fcstye,43,1.0,10,2020-03-03 10:46:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/fcstye/request_handllng_weight_gain_in_recovery/,False,False,2020,3
36,Request: Realizing you relapsed too late??,"I got really excited this morning to make nachos to eat as a meal for me and my partner. When I realized he wouldn't be able to share with me, I ended up feeling extremely depressed. I told him I was hungry and he told me to eat, and I immediately thought ""I should have eaten with my mom"" (I'm 19 in college and still live at home with my parents). 

I was in the hospital for severe stomach pain last month. They said my stomach was over-producing acid. My brother's girlfriend is a med tech and said that it could be because I haven't been eating enough. 

This situation today made me realize a lot. Like how the only meal I ate yesterday was the most I've eaten in probably over a month. I think it might be too late, but my inability to eat alone due to fear of losing control but also not being able to eat out because I don't want to be judged for eating by myself and the ways it's manifesting have made me realize that I'm relapsing (or quite possibly already have). 

He told me to eat. And because I'd be eating alone, I'm not going to. I don't know what to do. I can't afford treatment, as colleges and universities closing down also means I don't currently have a job. I also still have to pay the hospital bill from last month before I can even attempt a follow-up with a GI. I'm worried I'm getting back to the point where my body might start rejecting food again.

40,Request: Can't let go of weird food rituals,"I'm 24m and only just accepted that I have an eating disorder. I lost a lot of weight and ended up underweight, I am now trying to gain muscle, but I can't eat properly.

I'm eating xxx - yyy calories (low) a day now, which isn't enough to gain weight but I don't think I can manage any more. 

I take adhd medication which means i have barely any appetite anyway,  but when I do feel hungry I have all these rituals to make me eat as little as possible.  I'll have a coffee or green tea right before eating, then I will eat a bowl of lettuce to fill my stomach. I then put the actual food that I cooked on a small plate and cut into tiny pieces, then eat one bite every 30 seconds to make sure I'm slow and mindful when I eat. All my food is low carb vegan, weighed and calorie counted. If I don't know the exact calories I can't eat anything. 

After all those rituals I sometimes can't even finish the food, which always feels like an accomplishment. When I finish it I usually feel strangely guilty even though I WANT to gain muscle and be more healthy. 

How can I let go of these rituals? Every interaction i have with food is focused on making me consume as little as possible. On the rare occasions I'm able to eat more I just run and work out more to compensate.

42,"Request: I have anorexia, I'm feeling a bit lost and scared and idk what to do.","Hi everyone,

At the start of last semester, I started my transition (MtF). I live in a very conservative area, and was deathly afraid of using gendered restrooms (mens are humiliating and unsafe, women felt unsafe, and I couldn't find any gender neutral ones). I started just not eating as much food, and started skipping lunch entirely, so that I wouldn't have to use the restrooms while at school. 

Then one day I weighed myself, and found that I had lost a lot of weight, and I really liked seeing that number go down. So I kept tracking my weight, and started eating even less. I completely cut out sodas, then completely cut out deserts. Food started rotting in my house because I just wasn't eating almost anything. 

And the body image issues I had really didn't help. Especially when cis people feel the need to advertise how disgusting and unattractive they find trans women. I know I'm ugly, but do people really have to be so mean about it?

I'm also worried about what people will think if I tell them that I have an ED, since I'm overweight. People probably just think that me going from hugely obese to the overweight I am now is just me being more healthy.

But under eating has become a problem now. I've been dizzy, I'm tired all the time, I'm having a lot of trouble paying attention in class, I'm having a harder time solving problems in my science classes, and physical tasks have become far more demanding (estrogen accounts for some of this, but not the full degree of it). And I'm scared of some of the things that I read can happen as a result of Anorexia. I don't want to die, I don't want to kidney problems. 

The thing is though, eating is hard now. Even small portions make me feel bloated and nauseous and like I'm going to throw up. Food tastes off; when I had a small PB&J sandwich, it just tasted sickeningly sweet, and I had to force myself to finish it.

Anyway, thanks for reading, and I look forward to hearing everyones suggestions!",f3h0uc,34,0.96,4,2020-02-13 21:15:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/f3h0uc/request_i_have_anorexia_im_feeling_a_bit_lost_and/,False,False,2020,2
43,Request: I feel lost and no one understands it.,"I was extremely over weight and over the last 3 years lost alot of weight and I'm now on the low end of my healthy weight but I can't seem to stop.

Trying to eat a recommended calorie intake is stressing me out. 

People are saying ""just eat when you're hungry"" but I'm NEVER hungry. I'm constantly full, and then it's time to eat again. 

I have to track the calories or I will eat half or less of what my maintenance is, let alone any gain. The thought of the amount I need to eat for the day is genuinely stressing me out and feels time consuming.

 I keep going to the gym trying to build muscle but if I see the scale fluctuate at all I panic. It's impossible for me to register as a positive. 

I feel like losing weight was giving me control of my life and now I feel lost and spiraled without it. What the hell am I supposed to do. I feel like I look ""okay"" in a mirror, but I feel fat and disgusting if I see myself without one.

Is there advice anyone has? Anything? I'm desperate. 

Losing weight kept my depression and anxiety in check. Without that now I feel really, really lost.

I can't believe this has happened, I was so excited to get to maintenance and enjoy all these foods. But now that I'm here I cant stomach anything.",ff032l,31,0.92,2,2020-03-07 19:28:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ff032l/request_i_feel_lost_and_no_one_understands_it/,False,False,2020,3
0,Request: 100 days purge free. I don't know what to do with myself,"I’ve been bulimic since 1997,  as a 7th grader.

After years of this, years of being unable to go three hours without vomiting, much less one full day — I managed to stop. I had to quit dating entirely, because this was a massive tigger for me, but I felt this was life or death. I stopped modeling, stopped swimming.

Monday will be 100 days. The longest I’d previously gone since childhood was 33.

It’s a strange time to be in recovery: the isolation is actually helpful, because there’s no concern about what people see or think, day to day. But I’m also left completely to my devices, which has historically been bad news for the binging side of things.

I think the true savior has been the fact that going to the grocery store is frowned upon. So I don’t. I have what I need, but I don’t binge because I don’t know when I’ll go shopping again.

And now, 100 days. I don’t know what to do with myself.

I’m so sorry for rambling. This was the whole point of posting: I want to have a private celebration. I don’t want to watch anything disordered or eat anything “forbidden.” I just want to .. I don’t know.

So, I’m just here to hear .. anything. An idea or something. I don’t know how to be sweet to myself but I really goddamned want to be.

1,"Request: My wife just told me she’s Bulimic, and I’ve been doing everything wrong","My wife just told me she’s bulimic since high school (she’s in her late 20s now). She has told no one about it but me. After we talked (the talk ended badly), I immediately went online to look for advices on how to support my partner. I found out I was doing everything wrong when I didn’t know about it.

- I tell her whenever I think she’s pretty on a certain day (I end with the compliment with ‘today’)
- I comment on her eating habits (cutting carbs, not eating enough)
- I contradict her (strongly) whenever she tells me she feels bloated or fat
- I get her to eat at unhealthy restaurants with me a lot and I talk to her about food a lot
- I tell her whenever she has gotten thinner
- I am not good at diverting topics in our conversations, I usually dwell on the topic (which is a problem if the topic is about body image or eating habits)
- When she says she is fat, I tell her that I am fatter
- the list goes on

Things even got bad when she opened up about it cause being me, I quickly asked her if she has a plan to do something about it (which was wrong and I didnt mean it, I was just trying to be forward thinking, but it was wrong)

*** I have an anxiety disorder. So I really am panicking. It is 6 am now and I havent slept yet since yesterday when she told me about it. I feel really bad since I may have made her condition worse through the years we were together just because of how I naturally am. I am an honest guy and I find it difficult to not be honest with my wife when I am asked with questions such as ‘have I gotten thinner?’ ‘Do you think I put on some weight?’. Judging from the advices on what I should do to support her, I need to change how I normally converse with her and how I am normally interacting with her, and I am very worried if I can do this properly.

Please help me out. I really want to support her. Right now, she regrets opening it up to me. I really dont know what to do first. I am scared of screwing things up.

2,Request: feeling fake,"Does anyone else feel like their ED isn’t real (enough) because they got themselves into it?

I almost did it on purpose. I just wanted to be skinnier. I thought throwing up would be easier. I knew that was theoretically bulimia (technically purge disorder, because I never had binges), but if I just did it a little bit, or only when I overate, and stayed healthy otherwise then it wouldn’t count!

I feel like the idea of an ED in my head is someone who didn’t know what was happening as they developed it, or maybe someone who became this way because of a traumatic event, or even only people who do it to extremes.

I guess I’m just wondering if there are other people out there who knew that their behavior would lead to an ED and did it anyway.",g59ymb,183,1.0,27,2020-04-21 06:18:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/g59ymb/request_feeling_fake/,False,False,2020,4
3,Request: Embarrassed to say I’m hungry or need breakfast.,"Please post?

I’m hungry when I wake up. I can’t start the work day without breakfast or else I can’t concentrate and feel dizzy or lightheaded and distracted by hunger. I’m not one of those people who can just have a coffee and be fine until lunch. 

My boyfriend, who I live with, is the opposite. He can just have some coffee, lie in bed and look at his phone, and not need food for hours. If he does have something it’ll be like a handful of nuts or a protein bar while I cook a whole breakfast with eggs and stuff. He’s over a foot taller than me and never worries about gaining weight no matter how much he eats so already it’s hard to not compare myself to him. 

I feel so embarrassed when I wake up in the morning feeling hungry and wanting breakfast. I can’t bring myself to say “I’m hungry” and I feel like if I make breakfast I have to hide it. I feel ashamed that I need food when I wake up but someone so much bigger than me doesn’t. Sometimes I’ll make myself wait several hours until he’s hungry and wants to eat with me. If he wants to go to the store or something first I’ll go with him, feeling lightheaded the whole time.

4,Request: I have had an eating disorder my whole life and never told anyone,"I'm 26 male. This is my first time ever talking about this so sorry if it doesn't make much sense.

My eating disorder started at about 11 or 12, other kids made fun of me because I was fat and gave me a nickname that I hated. I started restricting calories and threw away my lunches. I lost the weight and managed to stay skinny in my teens. I was fit and attractive up until age 21, but I would go through episodes of binging, starving and just generally restrictive eating. I was terrified of bread and I don't think I ever ate any for 10 years. I over exercised a lot and would punish myself with it.

When i was 21 I injured myself because of over exercising. I became a severe alcoholic and gained a ton of weight, I was just eating and drinking all the time and would drink like 5 bottles of wine a day.  I ruined my life, I developed fatty liver disease and a bunch of other health problems. I was disgusting. After 1.5 years of that I finally stopped drinking alcohol and also decided to start fasting, which was just an excuse to starve myself.

I starved myself to try and ""make up"" for being fat and got down to xxxlbs (underweight bmi) at 5'10. I then got even more health problems and damaged my heart and organs. I never got ED help because I told the doctors that I lost weight because of drugs, i was too embarrassed to talk to them about it.

I ""recovered"" at age 23 but unfortunately gained most of the weight back and became fat again. I stayed fat like a year (without binging and purging) then someone made a comment about me so I went on a diet and got down to underweight again, but I never got as low as before. I also developed something like bulimia, I started binging and purging and chewing and spitting out food. I started taking the weight loss drug DNP as well and overused it and had what I think may have been a heart attack. I collapsed and my whole left arm felt numb. I woke up a few hours later and never told anyone.

After that I stopped taking it and gained up to a 'healthy weight' for a while (was still purging) then I relapsed on alcohol and gained up to my highest ever weight (xxxlbs - overweight) at 25. I'm now 26 and still obese but have lost 20lbs. I have cut back on drinking but still drink daily. I'm working on that.

The bulimia or whatever it is hasn't gone away, I throw up about half of what I eat but I'm losing weight much slower than I want. I think I'm starting to have more health problems. I know it's not healthy to throw up your food and drink daily. My gag reflex is fucked and I sometimes get extreme pain in my oesophagus when purging. 

No one in my life knows about my eating disorder, not even my parents or girlfriend. People have had their suspicions but I always deny it. It just feels like something really private to me. I don't feel ready to get help right now, I just want to lose weight and get down to a healthy weight so I can stop hating myself. I can't get help right now anyway because the UK is dealing with the pandemic and we are in lockdown. 

Honestly, I only want to lose weight, but I'd like to do that without resorting to starving  myself again. I haven't been able to eat ""normally"" since I was a child. I don't even know what that looks like for me. I've definitely fucked up my hormones, I rarely feel ""full"" no matter how much I eat. When I think i ate too much I feel guilty and i have to make myself sick, there is no other option for me. 

I don't know what to do about all this. I don't want to be stuck with it for the rest of my life.",fuyyqg,91,1.0,14,2020-04-04 18:45:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/fuyyqg/request_i_have_had_an_eating_disorder_my_whole/,False,False,2020,4

Plus, my sister is on a very intense diet at the moment, and you can tell she’s taking out her frustrations on me by criticizing every “unhealthy” thing I eat.

7,Request: I can’t stop thinking about my moms eating disorder,"I’m 21 and my mom would’ve been 49 but she passed away 2 years ago. 

My mom’s passing was unrelated to her ed, I was just thinking about it and wanted to get it off my chest. When she was much younger she struggled with bulimia and I didn’t know how bad her fight with this was until I was about 16. She posted a blog about how she would throw up multiple times a day and that she would take boxes and boxes of laxatives. When I found this out it just totally broke my heart that she struggled with that at one point in her life. I remember as a kid occasionally I would hear my mom throw up in the bathroom, and it didn’t happen a lot, but I still remember those moments and now realizing why she was doing that is mind blowing to me. 

Anyways, fast forward to a few months before she passed away. I was walking by her bathroom and we had just eaten together and I had to do a double take. I could hear her throwing up in the bathroom and I was shocked. I had no idea she began struggling with this again. After she got out of the bathroom I asked her about it and she said that she just gets nauseous because she was taking anti-depressants and that’s the only reason she was doing that, but I didn’t buy it. My brother and I tried to help her feel like she didn’t need to do that, but I don’t think we made any sort of impact on her whatsoever.

9,Request: I can't exist in this body any longer,"To say I developed an eating disorder at 13 would be foolish, because I have always had an unhealthy relationship with food and my body. As a young child, I was very overweight . I would hide and eat, so my mother wouldn’t be angry with me. She would send me to school without a meal, so I would binge heavily at my grandma’s at the end of the day. At 13, I was put on a diet and my obsession snowballed from pivotal decision. My lowest weight was severely underweight— I’ve been through multiple admissions to treatment, suicide attempts, ECT treatments, medications, lost opportunities, etc.

I’m now 31 and am no better. I am ashamed.

There is some good in my life. I have a daughter and stepdaughter. I have a home. I have a job I enjoy.

But I can’t live with myself. I hate myself so wholly and entirely. It consumes my every day and night. Food is the enemy and I am the enemy—nothing has yet to convince me otherwise. I wish I could shed my skin and be someone else. I wish I could disappear.

The depression and anxiety are tiresome. I ache, my teeth are damaged, my hair and nails are dry and brittle. I have no interests, hobbies or dreams. I have a degree in art but I can’t even remember when I did so much as doodle. I can’t focus on books or TV. And, to make it worse, the ECT has erased many valuable memories from my mind.

All that consumes my mind is thoughts of how to lose weight. Or to not gain weight. Thoughts of cutting off fatty pieces of my body or getting surgery. Taking laxatives or diuretics. What I look like in whatever outfit, what my makeup looks like or hair.

I step on and off the scale 100 times a day. I’ve seen nutritionists, I know all of the correct information. I’ve spoken to doctors. But, to me, they are the irrational ones.

I’m so tired of fighting all the time. Obviously, this isn’t the only negative thing that has happened in my life. I’ve had the bullying, the divorced parents, parent dying, etc. But the disorder is destroying me. It’s my coping mechanism, it is my life. I can’t stand my appearance, I can’t stand not being normal. And no one can (or no one knows how) to help.

I lost a ton of weight when I moved in with my boyfriend two years ago because I didn’t binge around him. (I was with him for a full year as a heavier human before this) I would never let him see/gain awareness of that part of my life. He used to think I was anorexic because I ended up so thin so rapidly.

Well we are living apart now and I started binging again non stop. Always at night. Usually sweets. I’m never hungry. I make myself so sick that I want to throw up all the way into the next day (and then I do it all over again anyway).

13,Request: Do you ever binge or over eat healthy whole foods?,"Does anyone binge healthy whole foods?

I’m curious to know the struggles of those who don’t binge on any junk food at all, but actually struggle with eating too much fruit, veggies, meat, and other whole foods. By “junk food“ I’m talking about anything that’s processed, manufactured, or has additives or chemicals in it. I know that there are lots of things that claim to be “healthy“ but if you look on the label most of them have chemicals and sugar in them which could also make them addictive.

For example, does anyone binge on too much broccoli/cauliflower, too much bacon, too much meat, too much fruit? 

I know that these types of foods are much lower in calories, which actually makes it easier to over eat on them and stuff yourself because psychologically your brain will tell you that you won’t gain as much weight as you would with the more calorie dense food like pizza, burgers, potato chips, etc.

14,Request: My mind during an eating disorder cycle,"I equate my weight with my self-worth in a different sort of way then usual

To make this clear I absolutely do not and would never do this to anyone but myself 

I’m 5’2 and (a normal BMI) currently, which makes me feel worthless. It’s a very average weight and I seem to derive self-esteem from being “different” and having enough restraint to be a very low weight 

I used to weigh a lot less than I currently do. I obsessively track my calories (even more at the time) and compare my BMI to others. Any half-pound I lost or gained I would obsess over, and I’d measure myself repeatedly to make sure I was getting smaller or at least not bigger. I had a small  waist which I was incredibly proud of because of how abnormally small of a measurement that was, and I wanted to lose more weight so it would be smaller. At my current weight it’s a little bigger and I can only wear baggy clothes because that’s too big and normal and I don’t identify with it

I don’t know if this gives an impression of being vain but I definitely never was, again I only had these standards for myself and actually hated the shit out of myself. I felt like I had no real worth or way of expressing myself other than through my body. It was not in a way of being sexually attractive either, just being able to show my pain and control externally in a way that I identified with

I did not and honestly still don’t identify with my body at an “average” weight. I wear baggy clothes thinking that I’ll wear more revealing clothes once I get below a certain weight. I’m currently stuck in a binge/purge cycle of some sort (I don’t vomit, just fast for days).

 I probably would have qualified as anorexic when I was thinner but don’t even know what I would be anymore. Even at my lowest weight (which fit the BMI criteria for anorexia, though I was never diagnosed) I didn’t really look skinny, just small, and I even had a family member say I was skinny-fat which would trigger me more. I wanted to be boney and “abnormally” thin, enough that no one would question it for a second

I wouldn’t say I had the kind of body dysmorphia that anorexics are typically portrayed as having. Although I’m very critical of myself I didn’t exactly see myself as overweight. I just wanted to see myself as underweight. Not attractive in a conventional sense. I wanted to be unusual, I felt that making my outside appearance unusual would match more closely to how I felt internally 

I actually remember some amount of this starting when I was a child, in elementary school. I hated being called cute. I’d scratch my skin up and wear black and rub my eyes to make my dark circles under them worse. I was small and had light blonde hair which I hated because people would tend to see me as some kind of wholesome innocent American girl. I think my kind of reserved personality made these impressions and thus my opinions about myself worse since people didn’t have as much to judge from. And I felt like I didn’t have much of a way of expressing it since society puts so much stock into corporeal existence as a reflection of who we are anyways. Especially girls

TL;DR if you want a look inside the mind of one individual with an eating disorder of some kind then I guess this is it.

I came into college around xxx pounds (5""1' - normal BMI) never thinking about what I ate, started restricting what/how much I was eating pretty intensely to the point that I would count all my calories and have binge eating episodes (only when I came home) and had access to a lot of food that was not ""nutritionally efficient"" and that I had been depriving myself of.

Last spring I was around xxx pounds (underweight BMI), not exercising really at all but very busy. This past summer I weighed myself every day and was around xxx pounds (still underweight BMI), eating yyy calories - a low number (I think - I don't know that this is accurate but it is what I was aiming for) or so calories every day and exercising pretty hard 4 or 5 days a week trying to gain muscle.

This past fall semester I made the decision to try to gain weight to protect my organs. I got rid of my scale at school and gradually gained weight to around xxx pounds (back into low end of normal BMI) eating quite a bit more (closer to xxx a day - a normal amount) but also cycling heavily because I didn't want to gain ""just fat"", up to 50 miles on the weekends. For the past few months (all of 2020) I have been at this weight even eating only xxx calories ( a very low number)  a day but not cycling as much and still gradually gaining weight. At the point that I was still gaining weight on xxx calories a day I decided I needed to actually fix my metabolism and stop obsessing.

Even though I'm back now near where my natural weight was before college, I think my metabolism is severely messed up from doing this for so long. I had read in the past that the only way to fix deprivation for so long is something akin to the ""Homeodynamic Recovery Method"" or eating a completely unrestricted diet so your body can adjust to having more than enough nutrients. Is this true? Is that what I should be doing even if I'm not severely underweight anymore?

TLDR: How can you fix  your metabolism after years of restriction?",fvo5ug,54,0.98,6,2020-04-05 23:52:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/fvo5ug/request_how_can_you_fix_your_metabolism_after/,False,False,2020,4
16,Request: How might one find feelings before a binge eating crisis?," 

How might one find feelings before a binge eating crisis? What does it feel like in the body?

I’m bulimic. My therapist suggested that when I have an eating  craving/hijack, I try explore those feelings for a few seconds (3-12s)  before grounding myself using techniques like the butterfly hug. This is  called desensitization. 

Problem is I have trouble finding those feelings. 

Here are the scenarios that end up in bulimia crisis’: 

1. **Gradual:** I’m bored or restless (usually linked to  procrastinating on tasks I don’t want to do, which are most things in  life) so I get a (sweet) snack to distract myself, then have a bit more,  then a bit more, and before I know it it’s: “I’ve eaten too much,  F-this I might as well go all in an purge after.”  
 

2. **Planned:** I’m out an about and a craving starts to  build up but because of people “watching”or because I won’t able to go  purge I’ll resist, however, I’m itching to get home and be alone to  ‘relief’ myself. By the time I do, I go strait into a crisis.  

3. **Hijack:** When I resist a crisis or had multiple  crisis in the day, I get food craving ‘hijacks’ where I feel like an  addict and there’s nothing stopping me. I can’t think and the one and  only mission is to relief myself asap. 

Background: 

\* I’ve been struggling with eating disorders for 20+ years and thanks to  years of psychoanalysis have a good idea about its roots (lack of  self-actualization, attachment to mother, etc.). 

\* Problem is knowing this isn’t helping me deal with my ED.

\* That’s probably because I’m numb and don’t feel my feelings. 

\* When I do have feelings they are usually negative and extreme (and  related to situations where my ‘ideal’ identity is threatened or fear of  abandonment from a partner, my father wasn’t in my life), in these  situations I go into food deprivation mode (anorexia). 

\* Life feels like a chore. I don’t know what it’s like to do things for  fun or out of love anymore.",g8xug0,49,0.98,13,2020-04-27 09:54:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/g8xug0/request_how_might_one_find_feelings_before_a/,False,False,2020,4

In the last three days, despite my encouragement, I’ve watched her eat a granola bar and one small microwave meal. I am really scared, and I don’t think I responded properly at all. I told her, honestly, that I was afraid she might die if she keeps starving herself. She started crying and told me that she would die if she got fat during quarantine.

21,Request: Is anyone else struggling with 'positive' posts about eating whilst in quarantine?,"Sorry if something like this has already been posted.

TDLR: I know how to control my bulimia in quarantine but people posting on social media about 'body positive' things is triggering me.

I've (25F) been suffering with bulimia on and off since I was about 14 years old. I'm able to control it quite well in my normal day-to-day life; I've been vegan for about 6 months which has helped and generally I do a lot of exercise which stops me from feeling guilty about eating. I have been feeling generally good about myself in recent months and haven't felt the need to purge for a while. However, since the UK has been in lockdown and I havent been able to access the gym and play my team sport, so I, like many others I'm sure, have been struggling to prevent myself from binging/purging. 

I've tried to manage this by ensuring I do daily exercise, whether that's a run, cycle or just a home work out. I'm also in charge of shopping for myself and my flatmate (who is high risk), so ensure I buy healthy foods and no snacks, I try to eat my meals at specific times so that I don't end up overeating and feeling guilty. Generally speaking, I have my bulimia under control.

However, when I'm on social media I keep on seeing people post about how we shouldn't feel guilty for eating or putting on weight whilst we are in lockdown and this just completely triggers me. I know they mean well and are just trying to help, but the thing is no I can't eat what I want and I do feel guilty about putting on weight? They send me into such a spiral of feeling shit and anxious and make me want to eat loads which results in me making myself sick. 

Has anyone else experienced anything similar? I know there's not much advice anyone can give, but I just wanted to get it off my chest because I've felt very alone as only my ex knows about my ED and I don't speak to her anymore.",gb2dwv,45,0.94,10,2020-04-30 19:26:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/gb2dwv/request_is_anyone_else_struggling_with_positive/,False,False,2020,4
22,Request: No control around food?,"I feel like I have, and have had, am eating disorder my entire life but I don't know what it is.

My biggest issue is I legitimately cannot control myself around food, especially sweets. If it is there, it will be a I think about. I go to extremes to stop myself, not buying anything I could eat a lot of, throwing away food (but not simply putting it in the trash I have to make it not edible, otherwise I will dig it out of the trash). But when I read the criteria for binge eating it doesn't fit.

I also feel immense shame about what I eat, I used to not eat in front of people, I did not want to be associated with food, I didnt want anyone to know that I ate or what I ate. I no longer do that, but if I eat a bunch of junk food in a day I feel SO so ashamed, I hate myself for it.

I do not throw up, or take laxatives. I don't under eat. I don't over eat to an enormous degree. I feel like I don't fit any of the eating disorders.

“Just eat. Just gorge yourself and indulge in everything you’ve wanted to for so long. Just forget about those restrictions you’ve made for yourself when you were recovering. Just eat. Then purge. You know it feels good. You know the euphoria and the high you get when you purge, how good it feels. How it’s all worth it in the end. You’ll be handsome, you’ll be skinny. As of now you’re just a gay ugly bitch, so just indulge in your vices and feel good.”

29,Request: Ideas for covering a mirror,"First post here! I'm about a year and a half into recovery from anorexia that lasted 15 years. I've been working from home and have been noticing a lot of my body image issues are resurfacing as I am constantly around mirrors at home unlike when I am at work. In particular, I have one mirror that is on my closet door that I cannot get rid of or move (rental property). The mirror points at the entrance of my room so its difficult to not look at it when walking in/out, and it points into the area where I get dressed.

I've been thinking something nice to do for myself would be to cover it up somehow. One problem I have is that neither of my roommates know I struggle with an ed and one of my roommates is rather curious and asks a lot of questions. She is also in my room a lot, so throwing a blanket over the door like I have now isn't really an option since she's already started asking about it.

32,Request: How do I tell my parents I have bulimia?,"I've been struggling with bulimia for 4~5 years  on and off, same with binge eating. I used to control my binge eating with bulimia to feel less guilty about my binge. BUT my binge eating is getting better.

So, I'm busy with weight loss because I'm overweight and I'm sort of obsessed looking at the scale and if it's not down how much I want it to be, I restrict or I purge everything I ate the day.

I've figured out how to control my binges and my bulimia, and I've noticed I have trigger foods. Im 21 and I'm living with my parents now since I can't be on campus during quarantine, so my mom is making food. Our whole family is overweight and my mom has no clue how to make a healthy meal, so she'll make pasta, pies, hamburgers and basically very high calorie foods. I asked her nicely to not make food for me when she makes stuff like that but then she gets mad at me. She keeps saying ""don't eat it then"" but she doesn't understand how hard it is for me to control myself is she sets a plate of unhealthy food out for me. When she doesnt make food for me, I eat healthy and don't binge or purge. 

I've been getting problems with my teeth and got a few mouth ulcers, which hurts very bad. I'm really scared telling my dad about this because I'm scared he'll get because he payed lots for my dental bills in the past, which is not bulimia related but I'm scared he'll think it is.

I just want to explain to my mom how hard it is for me to sit at a table with my family eating the shitty food she puts out. She thinks I'm ungrateful when I ask her if I can make my own food. They've been kind of proud of my weight loss and I don't want them to think it's because of the bulimia, because it's not. But i really can't go on like this anymore because I want to stop it.

0,Request: Who else gets triggerd by other people talking ablut their eating habits?,"so i‘m at the beginning of coming to terms with me having an eating disorder/ distorted eating habits. 
i really try to reflect on my actions and my thought processes when i‘m starting to feel like the topic of weight/ eating/ self-hate is taking over my train of thoughts. 

today i realized i get triggered when somebody (sadly mostly women) talk about their eating - especially when they mention that they didn‘t eat alot or at all that day.

so i was spending time with my boyfriend at his place when his flatmate came home from work.
she mentioned that she had a hard working day and then paused for a moment until she said kinda suprised that she didn‘t eat all day.
she is skinny and i feel really bad about my weight and looks when i‘m around her. 

she talked about her not eating all day before and i have to admit i got jealous that she was able to not eat all day while i feel like i‘m binging all day.
i also tried to talk to her about my strange eating or my worries about my eating habits and she answered: „if you‘re really unhappy with your weight you would just start working out more and just eat healthier.“

This hurt me a lot because i didn‘t feel like taken seriously and also felt like that - she as a skinny person with a figure that‘s in line with our society‘s body standard - doesn‘t really know how i feel with all my struggles.
so when she mentions that she didn‘t eat i feel disgusted by myself that i ate.

 in my mind it goes like: oh, if you would just stop eating you would look better too. she looks great and didn‘t eat. you did it. you look so disgusting. you‘re weak. just stop eating and you‘ll feel better.

my boyfriend and her were expecting guests later (also friends of mine) and i said before that i‘d eat dinner with them. but after her comments i told my boyfriend that i needed some time alone and that i‘d eat at my place and would come over later. 
at home i had a binge eating episode and now i‘m crying and looking for some kind of comfort...

i also feel like my boyfriends flatmate doesn‘t really think about the fact that her comments on her eating habits is affecting me. on the other side i don‘t think i really was able to tell her what‘s going on in my mind when i‘m struggeling with my eating habits/ my weight/ my look so i‘m not angry at her.

anybody else having those difficulties?
how have you dealt with it?

4,Request: Post request: Disordered eating vs eating disorders,"Hi there, 
disclaimer: *(1) this might be an unpopular opinion post. (2)I'm speaking from a perspective of ED survivor.*

I have noticed a considerable amount of *""Do I have an eating disorder?""* posts on this sub and could not figure out what makes me feel so uncomfortable about them. These posts seem innocent, advice seeking and the members of community can reassure each other and help validate experiences and emotions. And then I realized that it was the lack of differentiation between disordered eating and eating disorders that left me feeling uneasy.

**Disordered eating** is an epidemic in our culture. It is easy to develop an unhealthy relationship with food when it is made out to be the enemy. Food then turns into something to be feared or develops the allure of the forbidden fruit, paving the way for disordered food behaviours. [1] So lets face it - it is difficult to find a woman nowadays who has never tried dieting or some sort of other restrictive eating (from keto and veganism, to raw-plant based and paleo diets). 
> 53% of American girls age 13 are “unhappy with their bodies.”  This grows to 78% by the time girls reach seventeen. [2]
Low self-esteem, pressure to match unrealistic body types and connection of self-worth to ones perceived beauty -  are issues known almost universally by all woman.

Yes, disordered eating patterns should be taken seriously and it’s important to reach out to a professional team to help you find balanced ways and nourish your body. > While studies show that up to 50% of the population in the USA demonstrate problematic or disordered relationships with food, body, and exercise; the rates of clinical eating disorders are much lower, estimated from 1% to 3% percent of the general population. [3] 

So where do we draw the line between disordered eating and full-blown eating disorder? It is all about degree. An individual with disordered eating is often engaged in the same behaviours as those with eating disorders but at a lesser frequency or lower level of severity. [3] As with other mental health issues, it is important to explore how and to what extent disordered eating is affecting an individual’s daily functioning. Issues to consider include the following [3]:

* Concentration and ability to focus — Do thoughts about food, body, and exercise prevent concentration or impede performance at work or school?
* Social life — Is socializing restricted because it might require eating in a restaurant, consumption of foods that are scary or uncomfortable, or disruption of exercise routine?
* Coping skills — Is food consumption and/or restriction used as a way to manage life’s problems or cope with stressors?
* Discomfort or anxiety — How much discomfort do thoughts of food and body cause? Are these thoughts hard to shake and anxiety-provoking?

In treatment, I remember visualizing my eating disorder as a dark, beautiful angel. It was my best friend, my only friend. It understood me and provided comfort, **but only when I complied with the rules**. Eds are similar to abusive relationships - they hurt you but you love them… I guess I’m writing this paragraph to show that EDs in clinical representation are not solely about food and body; Eds became a strong and prevalent coping-strategy (you can almost parallel it to addiction - addicts know that what they do is wrong, would lead to destroyed relationships, financial problems and possible death, but the high is sooo good that they can’t resist it).

Thank you for taking time to read this post. I hope it was informative. 

*P.S.1 If you recognize the eating disorder patterns in yourself, if you consider them abnormal or unhealthy, then you are in a good shape!  From my own experience (and from talking to multiple people while inpatient/outpatient) people with full-blown EDs usually refuse to accept that they have a problem: they assume their eating/exercise patterns are normal, their weight doesn’t have a bottomline, they attribute multiple skin, hair, menstruation problems to lack of vitamins or poor genetics.
So if you notice the problem and feel the desire to change, you have already accomplished a great milestone. Congratulations!*

*P.S.2 Finally, if you are reading this and if you are concerned for your loved one, it is possible that they don’t “see” what you “see”. People with full-blown Eds prior to treatment would have a hard time admitting to having a problem and this is the stage where your help is crucial.*

5,Request: Gaining weight during quarantine & body image issues,"TW: relapse


I have been fighting with my urge to restrict again.
I have been in recovery for almost a year and I’d stopped weighing myself until a month ago, when I noticed I’d gained weight during this lockdown. 
Since then, I’ve been trying to fast and restrict to get rid of the pounds but I can’t do this anymore.
It felt fantastic not continuously worrying about how my body looks. 
I just don’t know how to feel okay when eating again. It feels extremely suffocating. 
Any help would be appreciated; I’m very thankful and proud of every single one of you 🤍",gnu0wb,99,0.99,11,2020-05-21 09:59:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/gnu0wb/request_gaining_weight_during_quarantine_body/,False,False,2020,5
6,Request: asian culture and eating disorders,"here's my post request: 

hi everyone, seeking support. i'm asian american and i don't really see culturally-specific help for people who grew up with family dynamics like mine. also don't see as much representation in general. my asian parents don't know how to respond to the problem. they seem to want to help but whenever this topic gets brought up, they say something hurtful. i feel like i'm being too sensitive when it happens, but it feels bad enough that i just avoid the topic all together. it's also an Asian thing for relatives and family friends to greet you with a ""oh hello ____ you look so good! you lost weight!!"" or ""oh hello ____ you gained weight!! omg stop eating so much"" and then proceed to shovel your plate high with party food. additionally i don't have a habit of being emotionally honest with my parents so trying to explain my feelings feels massively embarrassing. these are 2 people who lived through the communist revolution in china, where the government was disappearing dissidents, sending off droves of young people into the countryside for useless ""reeducation,"" and food rationing/crop failures created a generation of underweight children. basically they've been through some shit and in light of all that, i feel like my problems ain't shit. but they're still problems because they're my problems. i have a hard time reconciling this generational/historical guilt and feeling like my problems are real. idk if anyone can relate, but give a shout out if you do.

sort of related-- i found a related facebook group a few days ago for asians with eating disorders. it's pretty new but it's a start. basically a group for asians everywhere to vent and find support about their ED experience. i've just been lurking but a couple of posters have shared things that really hit me hard. hope this helps. https://www.facebook.com/groups/subtleasianeatingdisordersupport/",gta1dk,95,0.98,15,2020-05-30 07:13:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/gta1dk/request_asian_culture_and_eating_disorders/,False,False,2020,5

8,Request: How do you feel worthy of recovery when you’re overweight?,"Hello everyone. For a large portion of my life I have been stuck in a cycle of restricting and binging until last year I finally decided to work on myself and recover from my disordered eating habits. I began to start intuitive eating and I felt great. I was at the healthiest I had ever been mentally regarding my body image and physically because I had started exercising regularly now that I finally had the energy to do so. 

However, because I started to eat freely I had ended up gaining some weight. I already was chubby when I began intuitive eating so gaining the weight made me feel guilty, but I managed fairly well with it instead of relapsing. Now because of quarantine I have undergone a full blown relapse. In the beginning I had planned to lose the extra pounds in a healthy manor but I started to fast and restrict and then binge when I couldn’t handle my hunger anymore. 

I feel miserable, but I worry that if I stop fasting I will end up gaining even more weight. At least before I had exercise as an outlet to make me feel strong and healthier, but because gyms are closed I can’t cope that way. I am terrified of gaining anymore weight because I already weigh more than I should, but I also want to go back to living my life without worrying about how many calories I’m consuming. Does anyone have any advice for this?

I used to restrict, binge and purge, but now I don't binge or purge regularly anymore. I've been at home for the past two months, and during that time have been restricting my intake.

My mom has mentioned my weight a few times, whether she's hugging me and commenting on my bones, or saying that she just thinks I look gaunt in the face. I'm not with my boyfriend, but he's expressed similar concerns over photos and videos I've sent him.

But I just do NOT see it, and I don't understand how any amount of body dysmorphia could be deluding me this much? I know the concept, but is it possible to physically be unable to see your body for what it is? I just feel like a fraud. My mom or BF will say something to me about my weight loss, but I just feel annoyed and dismissive, and keep looking at photos of other women/celebrities who are obviously thinner than me. I don't think I look remotely like someone who is ""too skinny"", so I feel the need to restrict even harder to live up to their concerns.

I am at a normal (higher end of normal) weight. I used to be overweight, but I restricted calories to lose weight. I was quite strict with this restriction and lost my period for 2 months.

I was afraid of all the negative effects dieting has had on my life. I was also under a lot of stress due to adapting to online school and other projects. So I let myself eat a little more and I kindof freaked out because I gained back some of the weight I lost and tried to lose it again.

Now I am in a weird binge restrict cycle where I am just compelled to eat anything and everything at night until I am uncomfortably full, then going back into diet mode and running, and I hate myself through all of it. 

Tried intuitive eating, did not work because I have completely fucked up my hunger signals. I hate how I feel so out of control, like I'm spiralling

The messed up part of it is that I am so afraid of gaining back weight and I still want to lose weight because I still feel fat. I know I could lose weight, I just don't know how to do it healthily and not spiral like I always do and end up eating it back

15,"Request: worried about my sister, can I post this?","I (18F) am worried. First, I apologize if I'm being insensitive in any way, I'm new to the concept of this and it's my first time posting here. My sister is 16, and I have noticed that she's been eating less and less over the past year. At first, I figured she was just doing a slight caloric deficit to lose a little weight, as although she's not fat, she is a little overweight which she had told me before she wanted to do something about. I think she looks beautiful at any weight, but she dismissed me. Over the past few months, since quarantine started, and I've been home from University more and able to see what she eats all day, it's a startlingly low amount! Yesterday I heard her talking with my brother (10), saying ""omg, I ate Soo much today"". He asked what she ate. She said she ate some blueberries, and a protein bar. As a regular gym goer and lifter, I'm used to tracking calories (for weight GAIN so I can build muscle!) So I quickly realized that this was far less than a healthy intake! 
Now, Im athletic, and toned, so naturally I've become slim from exercising so much. But I also eat a LOT because I lift weights. I eat more than 4x the Cal's a day as she does, and I know that she envies my body, because we've talked about it before. And I myself have very good self confidence and I've never had an ED so it's really hard to understand where she's coming from? I don't mean that to sound bragging but that's how it is.
I've tried talking to her about nutrition, and how she needs to eat  when she's hungry. She says she never feels hungry. I offer to make her food, and I go out of my way to show her that she does not need to next to nothing to lose weight. I try to eat big meals when she's downstairs to show her that food isn't making me overweight, and that you can still enjoy food and be fit and healthy.  Right now, my sister is still ""overweight"", but I know that you don't have to be rail thin to have an ED.  I don't know what to do about helping her...I don't know how to talk to her?

18,Request: Is it useful to tell someone you have an ED or even just body image issues?,"Is it useful to tell someone you have an ED or even just body image issues? 

I have been actively trying to combat my mental health and openness about it over the past 4 years. I want to be as open as possible because I think we should be able to be honest about this darker side of our lives as a society - so I try to practice what I preach. Having said that, I find it extremely difficult to do this with my eating disorder history. None of the friends I have made in the past 4 years are at all aware of me struggling.

I find it difficult for a number of reasons. I find ED's are not talked about in the same way as other mental health problems - ED's are a long way behind other mental health problems in the discussion. No one talks about the true pain of putting your body and mind through so much trauma and it's really hard to help someone understand. Every time I have tried I have ended up in a puddle of tears. They're still glamorised but only when it's restricting which is fucked up. 
 && I don't want people paying more attention to what I eat and how I look. I am trying to avoid that at all costs because it triggers me. I can just about have conversations about exercise and meals but it has taken a long time. How do I forget about my ED when I know people around me are going to be thinking about my weight etc?

a new friend has asked to go swimming in the lake next week. I really want to because it would be so much fun ... If I didn't care about my body so much. I have put on so much weight over lockdown - which has been a battle itself - and there's absolutely no way I will enjoy swimming or be good company in that scenario with how I look now. 

(I haven't relapsed yet although I can feel it coming and this swimming invitation feels the first major trigger. I really don't want to eat for at least the rest of today. I haven't felt this strongly compelled to restrict in a long time.) 

I feel so confused about whether to tell my friend I can't go swimming because of my ED, make up another excuse (but what?) Or just try and do it (which makes me feel sick).
I really don't want to tell her about my ED and become even more defined by food and my body. I'm trying to leave it in the past as much as possible, & I feel like once someone knows, you can't really escape that. I've felt sick and upset since she sent the message and what to reply.

I think as a society we should be able to have a lot more transparency around body image and all mental health & I want to play my part in that.. but I can't bring myself to do it with my own ED !!!! Urgh.

How do you guys cope with talking about your ED and similar scenarios with friends?

20,Request: I'm struggling and could use some help,"Hi guys. I’m glad that there is a group like this with people who can relate because sometimes I feel so ashamed and alone. Although I’m sorry that you all are going through this to, it’s comforting to know that there are people in the world that understand.

I’ve had an uncomfortable relationship with my body and food since I was about 12. I then became a vegetarian- I thought vegetarians were skinny. I hid my motivations from my mom. I switched schools when I was 13 and was bullied for having a big nose, but people did comment on how small I was and I guess I clung to that.

At 13 I started binging and purging. My mom caught me once, and almost physically hurt me, but my brother stopped her and I ran out of the house. The school nurse found out and told my mom that she needed to take me to get help. My mom took me to a center, they said I should do outpatient treatment, and my mom took me to a pizza buffet right after that. And she said to me, you don’t really need help, do you? And I said no, I’ll be fine.

I wish she got me help. I wish she didn’t see it as a stain on her parenting. I struggled in silence for 3 more years and then met a group of people who I felt so comfortable around that I felt like I no longer wanted to be bulimic. I was so happy. I felt accepted. I felt loved. I thought my whole life changed, and it pretty much did.

Now I’m 25. I work in the tattoo industry and from the moment I walked into it, I’ve felt that I needed to be pretty, or hot, or else no one would like me. I feel like everyone in this industry feels the need to act like superstars. I got into this industry because I love art, and wanted to do it forever. I wanted to make art and saw tattooing as the way to go.

But it has been so hard. I never feel accepted. I always feel too short, to unattractive, to bubbly, to quiet, to soft, not edgy. Too kind.

I’ve been struggling so much lately. I realize that I need help. I need it really really bad. I’m not underweight. I’m just on the border and try to remain there. But it hurts my soul. I have an internal struggle with myself on a weekly basis about whether or not I should just eat what I want, instead of what I think I need.

It’s a fight. It’s always a fight. And it’s inside of me.

I just wish it was simple. I wish it wasn’t eat something you want and feel guilty, or eat something you think you need, and feel guilty for restricting.

I’ve come to the place where I just feel guilty either way.

I’m tired of feeling like I need to be beautiful. I want to just believe that I am, and have people in my life that love me for me, and don’t care about my outsides. However I fear that most of the people in my life like me for what I look like- who I’ve tried to be. Because I look like them. I even feel like my family would judge me if I gained weight. I feel scared.

If you read this I appreciate it. I’m just very very lonely right now, and I don’t have anyone who I can truly talk to about this stuff. It’s too heavy I guess.",gc2i7i,51,1.0,9,2020-05-02 07:35:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/gc2i7i/request_im_struggling_and_could_use_some_help/,False,False,2020,5
21,Request: Eating Disorder and relationship question," 

I've had anorexia since I was 14. There was a brief period in high school where I was a healthy weight, but other than that, I've been underweight. When I met my current boyfriend, I was probably about 10 pounds heavier than I am now. My boyfriend usually doesn't talk about my weight or eating disorder because he knows it upsets me. He also doesn't believe in marriage because he thinks it's outdated and has a negative experience with it (his parents and a lot of his friends' marriages have ended in divorce). I've always wanted to be married, but I love my boyfriend and want to be with him, so I've put the topic aside. Recently, I brought up my eating disorder (I forget the specific context), and he said, ""What if you got to and maintained a healthy weight, I would marry you? Would you do it then?"" I honestly am not sure because we have some communication issues that we're currently working on in couples' therapy.

After weighing myself today I realized I've lost a double digit number (as per group rules I am not saying what it is) but it was a horrifying amount to lose a little over a week.  

I'm not underweight at the moment but I may be in a week at the rate it is coming off of me. 

Since I'm associating not eating with saving my family I've noticed today I'm starting to get very anxious about eating.

23,Request: How do you get healthier without falling into old ED habits?,"Trigger warning for exercise bulimia and probably more things so maybe don't read this if you're struggling right now
I've been overweight for most of my life, and I've had an ED for more than 6 years now. Over the past year, I've tried to fix a lot of my dangerous behaviors (binging and purging with exercise, calorie counting, IF, etc.) and I've gotten to a place where I have a much healthier relationship with food and exercise. I was even at the point where I would almost call myself recovered. But since we've been staying home, I can't go to the gym or walk as much as I'd like to, so I decided to do a home workout challenge that would keep me active every day. And I've been losing weight. And even though I know it's in a healthy way (I'm not starving myself now, I'm not restricting, I'm not using exercise as a punishment for eating), it's still really hard not to fall into the same mindsets I used to have.
I started weighing myself every day, then multiple times a day, and every now and I would take my measurements, and it felt really good when the numbers were down. But sometimes they weren't, and even though I would tell myself that weight fluctuates and the scale saying that I'm a couple pounds higher than I was yesterday morning doesn't matter and what matters is being active and healthy, it would still make me feel terrible and that old part of my mind would tell me to exercise more to make up for it, which I know is wrong. So I decided the scale is not part of my recovery, and I hid it away and haven't looked at it for two days now. However, I still do want to lose weight as I am overweight for my body type. Is there a good way to track this without having to actually look at the numbers as that is apparently a trigger for my ED? I really am afraid of falling back into all of my old habits and I don't want to do that, but I do want to continue getting to a healthier place and feeling confident in my body. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a good middle ground I'm not thinking of?",gd8qdd,45,0.99,5,2020-05-04 09:54:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/gd8qdd/request_how_do_you_get_healthier_without_falling/,False,False,2020,5

But according to a concept known as visceral hypersensitivity, people with anorexia might pick up on bodily ""noise"" that the rest of us tune out. ”The theory is that they are hypersensitive to changing body sensations,"" Zucker says. ""The input from their physiology is constantly interfering with their ability to focus."" Extreme food restriction might be a coping response to that hypersensitivity, Zucker believes. In response to starvation, the body slows down. Heart rate declines, menstrual cycles stop.

27,Request: How to stop projecting my feelings onto my SO?,"I’m not sure if anyone feels the same way or knows what I’m talking about, but I’m hoping I can get some advice. 

My SO is one of the most amazing people I’ve ever met. He is aware of my eating disorder and is very patient and gentle with me. He never gets angry when he doesn’t understand my feelings nor does he belittle me. My SO is slightly overweight and is aware of this. He loves his body and is very comfortable with the way he looks. He has come to me before and stated that when he was much younger, he hated his body and thought he was overweight even when he was at his skinniest. I’m so proud (and envious) of his progression and I’m so glad he loves himself for who he is.

This brings me to the problem: my ED has made me so many times project how I feel about my body onto him. What I mean by this is that if I see him eating a snack after dinner, or with a big plate, or even just considering eating after we’ve already eaten, I make comments to him about how he shouldn’t eat more, how bad it is to eat dessert, etc. It’s gotten to the point where I know I’m going to say it and I want to stop it but it just comes out anyway. Then I immediately regret it afterword because it’s awful and no one deserves to be talked to like that. In a way, he’s getting a sense of what it’s like to live with my thoughts but I would never want to subject anyone to feel that way so I hate myself for doing it. 

He is very, very patient with me and I’ve communicated to him how sorry I feel when I say things like this. He knows it’s just my ED talking and I can’t exactly help it, but I know I can be better about silencing myself when it’s inappropriate. I just need advice on how to be better at this. These thoughts are always going through my head when it comes to my eating habits, but I hate myself so much for even putting such thoughts in my SO’s head. Especially when he’s been through some difficult times with his self-image.

I’m not sure if any of this made sense but I’m hoping someone has some advice so that I can be better for him.",gexqi5,39,0.97,7,2020-05-07 02:03:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/gexqi5/request_how_to_stop_projecting_my_feelings_onto/,False,False,2020,5
28,Request: I Need Some Advice,"Hello,
I'd just like to start off by saying that I don't think that I have an eating disorder, it's just that I think that this is the most appropriate place to seek help.

Earlier this year I began restricting and lost a lot of weight that I was very happy with, and after that I began to eat more normally. However, throughout that period of eating normally I was still quite obsessed with my body image, weight, and calorie intake. 

Recently I have begun to restrict again and whilst I definitely want to do this in order to lose more weight, I recognise that my long term behaviour in which I am obsessed with how thin I look in the mirror and the guilt I feel after eating food is not healthy for me.

I do not have the behaviour necessary nor the body type in order where I would feel comfortable seeking medical help - like I don't feel like I deserve it. But yet these thoughts and obsession in my head are really painful for me. I also don't feel comfortable reaching out to my friends and family, as I feel as a boy, that they wouldn't understand my issues of my body image.

I'm just seeking some help, as I feel I'm in quite an odd position here.

30,Request: First time post / coming to terms with my unhealthy eating habits,"So hi, first time poster but i guess i gotta start somewhere.
if you find any faults in my writing: english is not my mother tongue. fyi. hope you can still read it comfortably. 

so while in quarantine i started to realize that my eating habits are not normal.

informations: i started to gain weight after i started to use hormonal contraceptives. i feel incredibly unhappy with my weight, even my friends tell me they don‘t see any „gained weight“. but i feel it. it feels like every inch of my body is touching something (get me?) and i feel grossed out by myself.

why i feel my eating habits are unhealthy (physical and psychological: i eat all day. i don‘t feel like being full ever. when there are chips or smth to snack aviable, i will certainly eat way to much.
i spend most days with my boyfriend.
sometimes i tell him that i need some time for myself. then i go home and eat a full pack of chips. sometimes more. just to... calm me i guess?
i used to follow a vegan diet ( not for health reasons tho. more because of the ideology and because a lot of my friends are eating like that and it wasn‘t a big change for me) but recently i started to est eggs and cheese again. i love chees. it reminds me of home. 
but i feel like it added to my weight gain and i wonder why i gave up an activistic diet that was easy for me to follow. at least i was doing something. now i‘m just stuffing myself with food.
sometimes i throw away half eaten food, just to justify a binge eating attack - like: „oh i didn‘t eat that so it‘s okay if i eat this“
i try to be very body positive and mental health positive but i feel so fisgusted by myself and yet i can not stop to over-eat. 
i can not tell anymore if i‘m not overweight, slightly overweight or obese. my friends tell me i look „healthy“ and „normal“ (whatever the norm is) but i hate myself really much atm.

gaining weight feels especially frustrating because a year ago i was at my all time weight low. i‘ve never felt so... desirable? 
i used to not eat a couple days in a row at that time because i consumed substances that subressed the feeling of hunger. plus i stayed up all night moving, so i „exercised“. 
i almost feel like starting consuming again because i would stop eating. but my boyfriend is really good for my mental health and helped me laying off substances, so i feel like i‘d betray him. and i wouldn‘t want him to notice that i‘m high.
but i really want to stop eating so unhealthy.

sorry for the long text but i felt like i needed to get it off my chest.
does somebody feel kinda the same?

9,Request: What to do when someone you have confided in tells others about your eating disorder?,"I apologized for the length of this post. For some background, I am 27f, and have struggled with an eating disorder for 11 years. When I switched doctors a few years ago, from my childhood doctor to the doctor that I have now, I received a formal diagnosis of anorexia and did see an intern for therapy for six months. Otherwise, I've not had any other treatment. 

About four years ago, I started a new job, alongside a few other new hires. One of the other new hires, 50f, and I instantly clicked. She was very kind and seemed so wise. I felt like she had my back at work and I trusted her. We did things outside of work all of the time, and it felt nice to have a friend, as eating disorders can be very isolating. 

After some time, this coworker expressed concern about my eating habits and wanted to know if I was okay.  I decided that it would be okay to let her in. I shared everything with her, and I mean everything. She encouraged me to switch to a doctor who could help me, and she even went with me to my first appointment. For the first time in a while, I really felt like I was in control of my eating disorder and that I could get better. 

A few months later, an extra leadership position opened up at work and I really wanted to apply for it. It wasn't much, and the raise it offered was very small, but I wanted to do it. I was transparent in that I let my coworker know that I planned on applying. When it was known to everyone that I did get the position, that was when everything changed. My coworker cornered me alone and was very upset that I had gotten the position over her. She said that I didn't deserve it, and she threw back everything I had ever confided in with her as the reasons why I shouldn't have gotten it. I apologized because I didn't know she wanted it too. I was devastated. I didn't know what to do, so I just avoided her for a while in the hopes that she would cool off and that things would go back to normal. 

After that incident, many people at work confronted me with accusations of an eating disorder, saying that they had heard things. My coworker had told anybody who would listen about all of the things I had told her about my eating disorder. Some people were concerned when confronting me, but a lot of them were angry too, like I had purposefully kept it a secret from them. I just denied everything until people finally stopped asking. It was and has been extremely embarrassing. Though I have an eating disorder, I believe I'm a hard worker, and I always get my work done. 

However, it has really made work a painful place to be. I still have to work with this coworker, and she just acts like nothing ever happened. She still tries to talk about personal things, but I shut it down and do not discuss anything but work related things. I feel like I am completely isolated. I just try to do my job and go home, but I dread going back each day. Absolutely dread it. I stopped seeing the intern for therapy sessions shortly after and have been avoiding my doctor, because I just feel so stupid and I feel like I can't tell anyone else anything more about myself. I was wondering if anyone could offer any advice on what to do or how to make things bearable moving forward?",gxx71r,61,0.97,5,2020-06-06 19:20:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/gxx71r/request_what_to_do_when_someone_you_have_confided/,False,False,2020,6

11,Request: Struggling with binging and restriction. Advice on balance?,"So I used to struggle with restriction with eating. I've never had a normal eating pattern in my life. My dad says starving reminds you you're alive and my mom was a yoyo dieter. So I ended up restricting and malnourished. I started eating a bit more and gaining some weight.

Then I lost my sister in law. She was my best friend. I didn't realize until yesterday that that triggered me to binge eat. I've been struggling with binging since then. 

Now I'm working on the three meals three snacks routine. A problem I've noticed is if I feel like I'm not eating enough again I panic because of how weak I felt when I did restrict. Then I panic if I binge. I dont know how to find a calm approach. I'm tired of my stomach being bloated from over eating and tired of feeling like I have to starve.

15,"Request: No interest in food, has anyone gone through that?","Hello all, maybe this isn't the ""perfect"" subreddit for this, but knowing my history with EDs and eating, I thought that this would be the appropriate place to ask.

So, I have been having problems with EDs since I was around 14 (now I'm almost 21) because my mother kept saying I had to lose X amount of weight before people could consider me pretty or date-able and other things not so nice.

I have been battling with over eating and under eating, going from binging to starving to binging again, never really settling for normal eating habits, gaining and losing weight like a yo-yo even if I'm supposed to be an adult now and have found my ""adult weight"".

The problem is that I ""knew"" those phases: I knew that while starving myself I would keep on thinking about what food I would be allowed the following day, and I knew that when I was binging I would obsess over the food I could not eat while starving. Even if I was completely out of control, it felt like I had control over what I was eating. I was eating because I wanted, I wasn't eating because I didn't want, even if the reasons behind it were completely nonsensical and related to something I could not control. It was familiar, going from one phase to the other.

However, as things are now, I just have no interest in food. I eat what mother cooks for dinner and even then it's difficult to chew and swallow, and I leave most of the meal in my plate. I recognize it doesn't taste bad, but I have absolutely no interest in it. Even things I would eat when I was on campus for college because I loved them, now don't seem appealing in the least.

When I get hungry, I still go to the kitchen to look at what is in the fridge and pantry, but there's nothing that seems to be interesting enough for me to eat, so I go back to doing whatever I was doing before.

Has this happened to anybody else? It's just so weird I don't know what to do with it.",gv4mbh,52,0.98,8,2020-06-02 10:08:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/gv4mbh/request_no_interest_in_food_has_anyone_gone/,False,False,2020,6

every other day for the past couple of days i’ve gone over my calorie limit and it’s probably gonna happen today as well :/ i was doing much better when i first started cico but i feel like my increased awareness of my bad eating habits is somehow making me even less in control of myself.

i really don’t know what it will take to sort this, i tried not calorie counting at all and ended up eating mindlessly for the entire day (although ironically i didn’t end up going over my limit). i’m supposed to be getting referred to mental health services for another reason and will probably bring this up as well, but i have no idea when it will be. i wish i could just get a new brain or something so i could refresh my entire mindset on food :/

i somewhat feel like even if i could control my eating habits, i sort of feel like i don’t want to? like i could just not go and eat more food, but i’m also not trying that hard to stop myself. i hope that makes sense and doesn’t sound like i’m not being serious

22,Request: My success story," 

Quickly recapping over the past 2 years now, I went through a really hard time starving myself then it reversed last summer and I binge ate every day just to fall asleep so I wouldn’t be awake because the feeling was so terrible. I was not only in a hard battle with my eating and finding balance but I was mourning my mother (still am), along with a breakup. So it was terror to say the least it went straight to suicidal thoughts.

I am now a month away from my goal weight and I’m in a MUCH better place. But you NEED to know I’m doing it healthily. Once you maybe meditate in your own way and let go of what you think needs to be and just jump into practicing balance it becomes SO much easier. Maybe even book a trip or something of the sort and use that as motivation to start (because I know that motivation is very hard to conjure up when battling an eating disorder). One of the hardest things in my eyes with an eating disorder is finding balance, coincidentally I struggle with balance in all areas of my life. The change starts with you but you must first push yourself through everything. I do have my bad days but I usually notice my bad days the second I wake up In the morning and if I’m not working, I’ll make some plans and be sure to eat something before and keep my mind busy through out the day.

27,Request: Still Binging Purge/Restriction Free & A Normal Day of Eating,"Two questions. Sorry for the long post.

I'm a ""recovered anorexic"" in a sense that I instantly graduated to bulimia once weight restored. I have massive problems with binging, at my absolute heaviest. I'm obviously willing to recover so I entirely stopped purging three months ago and I've gone a year without depriving myself whatsoever, to the point that I'm eating giant meals (as a choice, not as binge) just to not get hungry resulting in a binge. That's how fucking much I fear it. Yet every day, 4-5 times a day minimum I binge. I binge hard.

So my first question is:

#1) Has anyone got an experience with a similar situation - relentlessly binging and food-obsessing without deprivation or purging behaviours? Please share how you got the fuck out!

-----------------------------

Also, obviously I went to one extreme to another - restricting like crazy to binging hard - so I naturally have NO SENSE of normal portion sizes. I have no friends nor social interactions because of isolation due to my ED, no co-workers to compare to since I've out of a job so long, so I have NO ONE to compare to except family which is completely useless. All I have is a mother that's always had a full blown ED and a brother that eats more than anyone (i.e. very abnormally).

So my second question is:

I've been relentlessly searching for a day of eating of NORMAL PEOPLE, i.e. not dieting, not engaging in any ED behaviours and is female, average height (i.e. someone with similar nutritional needs as me). I obviously only come across ""what I eat in a day as a fashion model/on this-or-that diet/to get super ripped"" and crap like that.

#2) Is there any platform/subreddit/forum that could help me with getting a notion of normal day of eating?

-----------------------------

I'm very smart, graduated with honors and had the most amazing life and job for my age, all of which I lost to my bulimia. I've destroyed my life.

Please help. Everyday I want to end it all. Everyday I wish I'd never been born. I won't hang on for much longer.

Every waking moment, every second food is on my mind - fearing it, craving it, being controlled by it and massive problems with hiding food inb the strangest places everywhere. I have no space for life. I go without showering for weeks. I hate it. I don't know who I am anymore. I don't function. My therapists don't know why the fuck nothing's working.

Please.
Help...

Please.

29,Request: Could prolonged bulimia cause food poisoning like symptoms?," 

hello everyone, this is my first time here and I'm not going to get into specifics just for the anonymity of this person. but I know someone who had been struggling with bulimia since long before I met them. within the 2 years I've known this person, they have had quite a few episodes where they thought they had food poisoning and would vomit, mostly bile, but also have bad stomach pain and nausea as well as sweating quite a bit even though they are very cold.

Just for the record i have always told this person to go to the emergency room and get checked out and the first couple times they did but basically got an iv and was sent on their way. after a while they stopped going and decided to deal with it on their own, against my advice so I try to be there and help them through it by giving them moral support, getting water and Gatorade, just overall trying to do whatever I can to be supportive. (I know what its like as a child probably from the age of 6 to about 15/16 I struggled with stomach problems like that at least once a every month or 2 and the doctors didn't do much they thought I had crohn's disease but it eventually culminated with an appendectomy which basically solved the problem entirely). I'm still trying to convince them to go.

There is a little more, originally I thought it could have been an allergy to alcohol since coincidentally they drank each of those times, not much but at least 1 drink. after that they abstained from alcohol entirely and was episode free for a few months until today. However this time I was told they only ate food and got sick about 10 minutes afterwards which I think is too fast for food poisoning but I'm not a doctor. This got me thinking of well some underlying issues, but I am a hypochondriac especially with myself and the people I love, as well as appendicitis because I know how miserable that can be. Then there is the obvious issue with the bulimia (which I've always tried to help them with but as someone who hasn't really dealt with that in my life I dont know the best way to help), stress, and anxiety this person suffers from.

I know stress and anxiety can cause a wide range of issues. I'm really scared for them and only want them to feel better and not have to deal with this.

So I'm wondering if prolonged bulimia can result in these symptoms?

As well as any advice to best help this person recover from this disorder, I would greatly appreciate. Sorry for the long post but any help or conversations would help.

TL;DR: this person has suffered with bulimia for years, and occasionally has these episodes of symptoms like food poisoning: could bulimia cause symptoms like this? some ER visits occurred but not much testing was done. they stopped going, against my advice, when episodes occurred.",h9ff2a,34,0.97,10,2020-06-15 12:32:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/h9ff2a/request_could_prolonged_bulimia_cause_food/,False,False,2020,6
30,Request: Dealing with parents' comments on weight," 

So, I had to go back to my somewhat toxic family during lockdown. I've moved back to my house near university last week. While I was at my parents' of course my mom started commenting on the weight (a few kg) I gained while I was in lockdown alone for a few weeks - I didn't have face masks to go grocery shopping so I mostly ate take out for a couple of weeks -. Well, as someone who was finally during well after battling two eating disorders, all those comments about how I should lose weight and my butt is too big and I look to big to be allowed kinda messed me up. I'm at the upper end of a normal BMI, so I rationally know I'm not obese -not that knowing it helps- and I also know that it doesn't matter how many times I tell my mom her comments hurt me and put my mental health at risk and that for once I want to focus on finding healthy eating habits instead of dieting, she still doesn't change her opinions and behaviours. Now, my dad overheard one of our conversations about it and - bless his male heart who doesn't really understand eds - he went into full fixing mode and booked me an appointment with a dietitian, which I went to because I didn't want to disappoint him and my mom even though I should know better by now. Now, I do actually want to lose weight because in this sub who doesn't, right? And I would like to get to at least the middle range of my BMI, but I don't think I'm ready for a diet, even if not super restricting. I almost relapsed during quarantine and I'm really scared that fixating on my weight and eating restrictively might make things worse. At the same time, I do want to lose weight and I'm afraid my dad, who's the only person in my family who at least tries to understand, will be disappointed if I don't follow through with the diet. He told me that there is no pressure but I know how much me being thin means to my family and I don't know how to tell them I'm not ready for a diet.

Because she's worried she ""tricked me into thinking she had a problem,"" I am only including a list of objective facts that she and I have agreed on. Please tell me if you think this is disordered eating, and of course any advice.

1. My friend is 6ft tall which is 8"" taller than the average woman on which calorie recommendations are based. She wants you to know she is overweight according to the BMI chart.  

2. Since at least age 9, she has been more concerned with how fattening food would be than enjoying it.

3. She once in her young adulthood ate so little that she was extremely thin and suffered some related health symptoms. She has recently described this as ""goal.""

4. She has been told by her mother her whole life that people would like her better if she were thinner, and she agrees.

5. Shortly after quarantine began she began to feel urges to reduce the amount of food she consumes. She began to skip meals.

6. Her eating habits concern her close friends who know about it .

7. Her mom has been very supportive of her weight loss, even when she told her she hasn't been eating much. Recently she told her she was proud of her for not eating.

8. After that, in the past month she began tracking calories.

9. No matter what her calorie goal is, she feels stressed unless she is a couple hundred calories below. She also overestimates her calories.

10.She weighs herself 5+ times a day.

11 She thinks that she looks extremely fat, and I think she looks normal and of average weight.

12 I convinced her to tell her therapist about her eating habits of late.

13 This is a new therapist who hasn't met her in person due to the virus.

14 When she told him the details and that she was worried she might have an eating disorder he told her he wasn't concerned and it didn't sound disordered.

15 He told her that the amount she eats is healthy and he would only be concerned if she regularly ate xxx calories a day (far below healthy). He wasn't concerned that she's lost ~8 lbs in a month.

16 Because of her experience in therapy, she feel like it's ok to continue on this path. I don't like it and I think this is a bad thing. She says she was worried for nothing and is sorry she tricked me into thinking she had an ED.

It’s difficult. I count calories but I’m always scared I might go back to my anorexic ways, because even if I try not to, inside I know I have an encyclopedia of calorie counts in the back of mt mind.

19,Request: How to get through this new weight loss journey without falling back into an eating disorder,"8 years ago I decided to lose some major weight. I managed to get just outside of my ideal weight but I did it in an unhealthy way, in that I developed a combination of eating disorders. I’d purge whenever I felt immediately after a meal I’d eaten too much. I was highly restrictive on what I are, by obsessively counting calories, and wouldn’t eat if I felt that I had done poorly the day before or would purge if I thought I ate too much. As I over came that, I started to just exercise everything off as I got fitter. I would do whatever it took to burn off the energy I’d just consumed, no matter how ridiculous the challenge was. Once I got down to my ideal weight I became more healthy. I are right and exercised like a normal person. I felt good about me. I still had issues with food and my body, but I fought threw them. Though my teeth and esophagus still had evidence of me hurting me, to the world I looked happy and fit. 

Fast forward to today, I decided years ago to just let go. I stoped exercising, stopped counting, stopped the healthy lifestyle I accidentally fell into after battling with different EDs. I’m now heavier than I ever was and highly unhappy with myself and my body. I want to be fit again, but I want to be healthy. I don’t want to get into hurting my body again to get something fast. The thing is yesterday I purged. It’s the first time in years but I didn’t hesitate. I’m afraid I’ll fall back into an ED while I try to get my eating and exercise back to healthy amounts, it’s why I’ve been so hesitant in the past. 

Are there things I can to to keep myself in track and losing weight in a healthy manner? I’m afraid to count calories because of my past, but intuitive eating also makes me anxious cause I know I have a larger appetite cause of my current size.",hwmjml,56,0.95,12,2020-07-23 19:43:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/hwmjml/request_how_to_get_through_this_new_weight_loss/,False,False,2020,7
20,Request: I fear staying at home with my parents will reignite my disordered eating habits,"So this is something I'm planning on bringing up in therapy during my next session but that isn't for a while so I was hoping that someone here could give me advice in the meanwhile. 

Moving back home with my parents and younger sister during lockdown has in some ways been really helpful - university (which I've now graduated from) was definitely the driver of a lot of my neuroses and mental illnesses. I'm slowly getter better and having a better relationship with food and exercise. 

However, my parents are quite severely overweight and have really bad eating habits. While this hasn't really been an issue during lockdown, my thinking has been 'once lockdown's over and I can move out, I will have complete control over what food is around me'. However, my parents are really strongly against me moving out especially because I have a job lined up (which I don't want to take) which is super close to our house. In the current climate, I don't know if I'll be able to find another job further away or be able to tell them the true reason why I want to leave the house so much, as I understand it's super insulting. 

Now I'm faced with the possibility of living with my parents for the next two years and I hate to admit it but it's getting me really worried. It's both the fact that I don't want to become an overeater like them and end up gaining loads of weight again (chubby kid). But there's only so much control I can have with myself around foods that they stock. I don't want to have to place rules and restrictions around the types of food I can eat in the house as I know that will lead me down a very slippery slope. 

I have tried to make the house eat a little healthier but their eating habits and wilful ignorance around nutrition and exercise makes me so bummed out and worried I will end up gaining loads of weight or super restricting myself.

So in high school one of my friends became unwell with an eating disorder, and went into an inpatient facility soon after.

Obviously our high school friend group are in university now, and I can tell she’s feeling left behind and it’s making her feel like recovery is even harder as she’s so far behind. She doesn’t share much about her ED with anyone but her best friend which is fine, but I find it hard to keep in touch without worrying I am triggering her or making her upset.
I know I should be a better friend as besides from inpatient facilities she hasn’t made any friends since high school that didn’t also have EDs, and I want her to know I still love her lots.
What can I do to help her? She’s quite far away so visiting is hard, and I have quite bad anxiety with one on one visits so that’s hard, if I check in she just says she’s doing fine and that’s it, which doesn’t really start a conversation.

25,Request: I threw a way my dinner....,"I have posted on the sub before to get advice and ask if if I had “eating disorder like habits” I got a few replies and all of them replied with a form of “yes”...... this was scary for me because I didn’t want to develop an ED eventually, I’m pretty sure nobody does. It started off with me losing weight I’m still not at my “goal weight” yet so I don’t feel like I can stop yet but I’m a healthy weight according to the BMI calculator, I count my calories before I would just guess but I recently started to use the food scale in my kitchen and it’s made me even more obsessed with calories and my weight.

I always plan my meals before since I usually cook for myself I’m only 16 so I still live with my family but they give me freedom to eat what I want and cook for myself but my stepmom decided to make ribs, baked beans, and coleslaw I didn’t know the calories for the food and this absolutely terrified me so before she cooked I went to the store and I got pre-made food from the deli and hid it so they wouldn’t know I had gotten something else and I don’t want to be rude so I made a plate of the food she cooked but I threw it away as soon as I got to my room and just took out the food I bought and ate instead.....I never did that before and I don’t think it’s a good sign.

27,Request: Advice on GF and her ed,"Hi there. I've never posted on here so I'm not quite sure how to do this, and apologize if I get it wrong.

My(21) girlfriend(22) of one year has struggled with eating for nearly five years now. This has coincided (or is symptomatic of) some rough home stuff, and a long term predatory relationship an older friend of her family's.

Her home life is much better now, she told her family about the friend, she's seeing a therapist, and she is actively and consciously seeking recovery. 

She's remarkable, incredibly strong, and I am unbelievably proud and supportive of her.

I know that this subreddit offers plenty of help along the lines of ""How to talk to her about it?"", and I appreciate every post but I would just like some advice slightly more in line with her/our situation.

I worry endlessly about her. I recently found out she still purges a few times a week, and it's all I think about now. Though she has opened up to me, I know she still keeps things from me to prevent me from worrying. Ironically, this makes me worry more because everything is left up to my imagination and I instantly dive straight into worst-case scenarios. 

I don't know how to approach it. I obviously want to be completely in the loop, no matter how scary that loop is, because I don't know what she's not telling me, and I fooled myself once into thinking it was better than it was because of this, which led (in part) to her normalising her behaviour since everything seemed fine. 

How do I approach her more often and more transparently without seeming like I'm interrogating her? Or is the best course of action not to so actively pursue it?

Secobd is something slightly more niche (and out of taste perhaps, I'm sorry, that's not my intention but I totally understand if you want to leave this out). In the bedroom, my girlfriend really likes to give. She loves going down on me, and she likes it if I get rough because she doesn't have a gag reflex. It recently dawned on me as to why that is, and now I feel uncomfortable with it because it just leaves me feeling paranoid again (which is making it about me, I know, I'm sorry). I think I want to bring this up with her, but also don't want her to feel ashamed about it. Is there any way to do this? Should I just not bring it up at all? Am I being overly neurotic about this?

Thank you for your time, and best of luck on all your journeys.",hzxxxr,44,1.0,4,2020-07-29 09:52:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/hzxxxr/request_advice_on_gf_and_her_ed/,False,False,2020,7

32,Requests: Parents' critical comments about my eating," 

My (20F) parents are very critical towards me, always have been, and considerable more than my three younger siblings. This I understand as I am the firstborn child and older sister, I get this to an extent.

My issue arises when they constantly feel the need to comment on my food. In middle and high school, I went through periods where I was bulimic and extremely restrictive with my food. I struggled a lot with body image and weight. I have always been relatively thin, but my weight would regularly fluctuate 10-15 lb because of this. I would either be underweight or healthy weight. Only after I graduated high school and lived mostly independent at college did I finally find food freedom and balance in this area of my life.

I have been home for the first time since going to college long-term because of covid. The comments my parents make about my food and eating habits drives me insane. I eat  a normal amount, maybe even less than normal. I eat pretty healthy because that’s my preference, but I am not crazy about it and also enjoy all types of foods (I am not picky at all). I don’t think I eat any differently than other people I know. Also, everyone in my family usually eats at their own time, including all my siblings. We do not usually eat as a family.

Some examples of what my parents say include:

“You’re always eating”

“You just sit and eat when you want to like a weirdo”

“Why are you always in the kitchen”

“You make all these weird little foods and eat them by yourself like an antisocial person”

Within a month I found myself regressing back to habits and thoughts I had when I was younger. My self image has deteriorated when I had been making so much progress. They have recently been comparing me to my aunt (who they hate), because she is also vegetarian and liberal. They put me down when I am eating and constantly compare me to my aunt because we share those two similarities. My aunt is twice divorced and they sometimes even say that I will “end up like her”. This conversation always stems from them commenting on me eating. I have no idea why they do this. I have tried to ask my parents what they mean when they make these statements but they always just fall back on calling me “weird”. I have spoken to my mom about my past with poor body image. I want it to stop because it has come to the point where I don’t want to be seen by others if I am full or bloated. It makes me feel absolutely disguising.

I’m so happy to be in recovery, but one thing no one talks about is how expensive it is...

when my eating disorder was at it’s worst, I would only eat at work, so my food costs were effectively zero.

It’s so nice to be cooking again & getting groceries for myself but it is a big financial adjustment. & with this pandemic, i’m making like half of what I used to.

but overall what is most overwhelming. is that i can’t afford to get myself new clothes to accommodate my new healthier body. wearing clothes that are too small for me is really damaging to my self esteem & my recovery. and not to mention extremely physically uncomfortable.

right now I have 14 pairs of pants that no longer fit, & one single pair of stretchy pants that do.

& with my shirts the only ones that fit me are my comfy pajama type shirts. or shirts that were once cutely oversized are now just an awkward fit.

I’m surprisingly ok with my new body, it’s soft and curvy & cute ! but as soon as I put clothes on, i feel so incredibly ugly & unfashionable.

I’m at a loss, I know that if I had nice clothes that fit I would feel soooo much better about recovering.

But I really can’t afford to get new clothes.

even thrifting is a bit too expensive for me right now & I struggle to find clothes that fit properly & that are still nice. plus shopping can be somewhat triggering for me.

but I know I can’t be losing weight just to fit into these old clothes.

not sure if i’m looking for advice or not.

2,Request: I just realized my mom is one of the reasons of my eating disorder,"I (25F) just moved back with my mom after living by myself for 6 years due to covid. I’ve always struggled with eating well and eating the “right” foods and avoiding the “bad” ones. I even did my bachelors in nutrition because I wanted to know more and it was a topic I always felt drawn to. During my years in college I was very happy with my eating habits, I never felt guilty and exercised a healthy amount of time due to the fact that I was learning a lot and nobody shamed anybody about what you ate.

However, now that I’ve moved back in... I feel guilty every time I eat a chocolate, chips or if I just feel like eating some noodles for dinner. I started noticing that every time I eat a “bad” meal, my mom always makes fun of me saying things such as “wow you’re eating so healthy” or if she sees me grab a chocolate and a little bit later some chips, she would tell me to stop eating or raises her eyes when I go grab some snacks. She does the same when I don’t exercise as well, which of course makes me feel guilty even though deep down I know it’s healthy to take breaks and to not be so strict with your eating habits.

To be honest I don’t know where to begin to start healing again as I always feel ashamed of my body and what I eat while I’m living with her, I’m in a healthy weight and I’m an overall healthy adult but now food controls my life and I’m always struggling to choose what to eat.

7,Request: I'm so sick of this. But I don't know if I can stop.,"Hi everyone.

I struggled with a restrictive ED three years ago, made full physical recovery in the meantime, but basically, this summer, I'm finding myself in a relapse.

I've lost more weight than I intended, and unfortunately, I like it, and I want to keep going. Intuitively, I know this is toxic thinking. I know this is my ED brain trying to win over my real brain, so I wonder why I can't just stop.

I went on vacation a few weeks ago with my lovely boyfriend and it was so nerve-wracking for me. If we were going to have a meal out, that's all I would generally allow myself to have because I was so anxious not knowing the calorie counts of those meals. Tomorrow, we are celebrating our one year anniversary, and of course having a meal out will be involved, so I've already figured out a way I can keep myself from eating hardly anything the rest of the day.

Lately I've been getting worse, intentionally skipping meals, or replacing meals with very light snacks to create a larger deficit. I know this is bad. I know this is harmful. I hate fighting the hunger, going to bed feeling like I have zero energy left in me, feeling so anxious about anything food related. My body image is so damaged that I feel like the only way I can like it is if I become underweight again, but even I know this won't be true. There's never a light at the end of the tunnel with an ED.

I just want to genuinely enjoy my anniversary with my sweetheart without being so anxious and guilty about eating, or having to worry about starving myself to make up for that one outing. He knows about what's been going on and is trying his best to be very helpful, but I can tell at this point that he's getting frustrated that it just seems like a dead end because I'm so hesitant to take his advice when he simply just tells me to eat more. Why is it so hard for me to do that? Is that how bad this has gotten?

I just don't know what I can do. I want to have a better body image and I want to stop being so obsessive my food intake and weight, but I feel like I can't have both of those at the same time. I don't really know what I'm looking for in this post other than just to rant, but maybe someone can give me some insight that I can't see myself.

TL;DR: I am so sick of this ED mindset but I don't know how to quit, but I feel like it's getting the way of enjoying my life and could ruin my relationship if I don't get this under control. I hate this so much but it's taking me over.",iapvh9,72,1.0,9,2020-08-16 10:04:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/iapvh9/request_im_so_sick_of_this_but_i_dont_know_if_i/,False,False,2020,8

I've been struggling with a small list of physical issues which are making it very hard to gain weight on top of a long recovery from anorexia.

The motivation or even memory to eat throughout the day when I'm alone is near non existent.

I guess I'm wondering if anyone else well into recovery has noticed this too. It doesn't always seem like a conscious decision to not eat, but it's almost as if I can't bring myself to want to eat (even if I'm hungry) until there's somebody else eating as well.

I’ve felt ashamed when people have seen even a sliver of your body; I don’t think I wear anything besides hoodies and sweatpants nowadays. I hate that I have to eat in front of people.  I hate the thought they’re seeing me eat. It feels as though my embarrassment is so great these days, I can barely go on.

As a result of this chronic shame, I am resentful of recovery. I don’t want to keep going; I want to go back so that I undo all of my new habits. Obviously, this isn’t sustainable long term, so does anyone know some healthier ways of dealing with shame?",i38apq,66,0.99,6,2020-08-03 23:36:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/i38apq/request_how_do_you_deal_with_shame_in_anorexia/,False,False,2020,8
10,Request: Feeling really lost after ED referral was declined. Not sure where to turn or how to get help at this stage?," 

Initially spoke to counselling service recommenced by my GP but they weren't able to deal with my case. I then went back and was referred to an adult ED service however because I purge around 4/5 times a week rather than everyday so my request was declined.

What are my options at this point? my diet during the week is some crackers and apples, at times I break down and eat some pasta or something similar but I panic right after and purge every time, weekends are worse for me as I'm not at work then. I've been doing this for over a year and I'm worried about the damage I've caused to my body. I can't talk to friends or family being a 25 year old guy so any tips or comments of any kind would be great.

I am obsessed with how much I weigh, I have to weigh first thing every morning if not my mind obsesses on it until I do, if I gained any weight the day before, even an ounce I instantly hate myself for the rest of the day. Everyone tells me I'm of average weight but when I look at myself all I can think is that I look like a massive pig. Anytime I get hungry the thought of gaining weight is so overwhelming that the thought of eating makes me nauseous, to the point the smell of food will make me sick. Other times I just keep thinking no you're to fat to eat, or you'll never be pretty if you keep eating, or you don't deserve to eat.  I have medical condition that if I go to long without eating I'll have seizures, but I push myself as close to that line as possible, when I feel that I'm starting to get sick I'll force myself to eat but the whole time Im eating I can't stop telling myself that I'm fat, ugly and worthless for eating.",i3uq0v,62,0.97,14,2020-08-04 23:53:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/i3uq0v/request_my_husband_is_convinced_that_i_have_an/,False,False,2020,8

13,Request: Trusting the Process is So Hard,"I have always had disordered eating (restriction; purging; binging). I more or less maintained a healthy weight (though not healthy behaviors) for a few years, but then with covid I sank into binge eating and gained a lot of weight.

Enough was enough, I got myself a nutritionist and into therapy. I have been binge free since the day after the first day I met with my nutritionist (four weeksish ago). My weight has been stable, more or less, with even a slight downward trend, presumably from not binging. My nutritionist wants me to chuck the scale but I’m not there yet. 

Even with this progress...it’s so hard to contend with this weight gain. I see pictures of myself and literally can barely recognize myself. And it’s not just dysmorphia - there’s a real difference. I had to buy a whole new wardrobe for returning to work—for people who will see me after months looking so different.

I can’t move the way I used to. I love hiking, and when I tried a hike that would have been no problem for me last summer, I literally threw up from over-exertion. I have a wedding dress hanging in my closet (a beautiful, beautiful dress I loved and felt wonderful in) that would never fit me right now. I already had to postpone my wedding because of covid and I don’t want to lose the dress l loved too.

14,Request: Pregnant with baby #2 and bulimic,"This is partly a vent and partly asking for advice and/or reassurance. 

For some background, I’ve been bulimic with restriction for years and years. Then in 2017 I got pregnant with my first child, and I stopped smoking and drinking as soon as I got a positive pregnancy test. I did purge a couple times after I found out I was pregnant and always felt consumed by guilt afterwards and fear that I would lose my baby and it would be my fault. I had my healthy baby in early 2018.

Now I’m pregnant with baby #2. Very much planned. I was late for my period by 5 days last Sunday so I took a test and it was positive. Again I immediately stopped all drinking and smoking, but I again I have purged a couple times since I found out, and I keep crying afterwards and apologizing to my baby and promising I won’t do it again. So I’ve already broken a promise to my child and he or she hasn’t even been born. I’m so overwhelmed with guilt and fear. This baby will complete my family and I know if I lose this pregnancy it will be my fault for purging. I refuse to do it again from now on. I will not do that to my child again. I will not break another promise. 

But I’m so so so scared. I keep reading about how bulimia increases chances of a miscarriage and I’m so afraid. I guess I’m just looking for some reassurance (even though nobody can predict the future lol) or some advice on how to get the disordered thoughts out my head.

18,Request: my eating has become disordered and i need advice/opinions on how i can fix it!," 

i was extremely overweight growing up and due to a health condition caused by my weight, i joined WW to shift the weight. i am now a normal weight for my height and i have noticed that (of no fault to WW), my relationship with food has went from one extreme to another.

i find that i look forward to eating and am very stringent about when i do so. however i am restricting my calories far too much and i don’t feel comfortable eating anything that’s deemed more than around x points (small #) on WW. i am now far too anxious to eat much and my family have noticed and become extremely pushy and frustrated and are constantly nagging me to eat more. if i try, i just get anxious and have even been brought to tears at how stressed i am at the prospect of eating.

i have seen my GP and she has referred me to counseling. however, i feel as if i still need to make changes in the meantime. i cannot afford to see a dietician/nutritionist, so this is my best (and uneducated) bet.

i do not feel comfortable coming off any kind of diet/tracking system completely. i have considered coming off of WW entirely and using myfitnesspal to count calories. the main benefit is not considering points when eating may help me eat different things and potentially increase my calorie intake (gradually, of course, as i can imagine my metabolism is too damaged to go up to my TDEE maintainence number so quickly anyway) and along with counselling, may help my damaged relationship with food. when i proposed this to my family, they were very against it due to my success on WW.

i was wondering if i could get any external and objective opinions on if this would be a good idea? i am also very open to other suggestions! thank you for reading if you got this far!",ibxy3b,53,1.0,3,2020-08-18 09:43:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ibxy3b/request_my_eating_has_become_disordered_and_i/,False,False,2020,8
19,Request: I went to the doctors and they want me to come back........,"Thursday I went to the doctors it was the normal routine go in get your height and weight and go wait for the doctor to examine you. Me and my dad are waiting in the room and the doctor arrives and the first thing she said was “it seems you’ve lost quite a bit of weight were you trying to do that?” I responding with “yes” I was actually trying to lose some weight since I was overweight and now I’m classified as a healthy weight. There were some papers there for me personally to fill out while she asked me about my calories intake which I told her and she told me it was too low and asked me how I was feeling but I felt fine she dropped it after that. The papers asked me if I had tried starving myself or bingeing, purging, any type of disordered eating I looked at the yes checkbox and decided to skip the question and come back to it but after she asked me those questions about my weight and calorie intake I quickly went backed it checked the no box.... a few more questions later it asked me how often I thought about weight loss and had anxiety about food I checked the several days a week box, I gotta be kinda honest right? Then a nurse came in took my blood and I got some shots and I left. Later that day the doctors called back and I guess they told my parents that I had lost thirty pounds in a year and my blood sugar and vitamin  D was very low im a 16 year old girl that isn’t normal... and they wanted to see me again on Tuesday. That night I deleted myfitnesspal and decided to stop counting my calories and just eat what I wanted, and the the 3 meals now recommended by my doctor... I never ate breakfast but the next day I did and it honestly wasn’t bad except I had to wake up early to fit it into my day which was new since I usually woke up at 12:00 in the afternoon everyday, that day I didn’t track anything and I felt okay it kinda displeased me that I couldn’t count but I also wanted to be healthy I still hadn’t reached my “goal weight” but the doctors visit scared me and I’m pretty sure my parents are starting to think I have an eating disorder and maybe I do too.... I just don’t have the common symptoms I don’t ever starve myself as long as it’s in my calorie budget I’ll eat whether it be cookies or chips of course there are foods that I avoid like fast food but I feel like everyone who’s trying to watch there figure does that right? I don’t binge because it scares me to eat that many calories that’s not normal is it? I get a bit repulsed when I walk past foods in the store I deem unhealthy.... I’ve purged maybe twice and after the second time I know I won’t do it again because it just didn’t feel good doing that too myself. But today was the second day of me not tracking and all I could think was “don’t weigh this food out”, “don’t step on the scale”,  “eat this it’ll be good for you”, “I don’t want too it’ll make gain weight..but you have too, they’ll think something is wrong if you don’t”, “how many calories do you think you ate?”....I feel sick right now because I’m scared that I’ll gain weight back I planned on slowly adding back calories to my diet after I lost a few more pounds but since I decided to stop counting since it put in a bad place I don’t know what to do.... I don’t want them to diagnose with an ED I don’t think I have one I just think I have some bad habits that I can work on by myself I don’t want my family to be upset with me I know they’ll try to blame themselves he’ll they tried to force feed me a smoothie yesterday and make it seem like they weren’t.

22,Request: Mental Hunger vs. Mindless Eating?," 

Hey guys,

I'm wondering how to differentiate between mental hunger and mindless eating. A little backstory: I'm working with my psychologist and nutritionist on increasing my calories, and have stopped weighing my food, tracking things in MFP, etc. I'm focused on giving myself bigger portions than what I would normally, and my goal is to honestly regain my hunger cues and trust my body's signals again. I'm feeling good, although still very early on in recovery...like 3 weeks in.

The biggest thing I'm noticing though is just mindless eating. I'm not necessarily thinking about food and then just eating (which is what I think mental hunger is, right?), but rather, if food is simply there I'll just start eating it. Not because I'm hungry, not because I like it/it's a food I want to eat, but eating it just because. To me, that feels more like mindless eating, but I honestly have no idea at this point because my hunger cues are just so effed up.

Have you guys experienced this before? Is there a difference between mindless eating vs. mental hunger when in recovery? And if so, is there a way to limit the mindless eating and be more intentional?",ibbdy8,51,1.0,5,2020-08-17 10:08:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ibbdy8/request_mental_hunger_vs_mindless_eating/,False,False,2020,8
23,Request: How should I respond to boyfriend's comments?," 

So ive had a eating disorder since i was young years old.(trauma related) Ive been through them all. Anorexia, bulimia, binge eating. Anything eating disordered ive been there.

When i met my boyf i was anorexic. This was over 10 years ago. I went through bulimia and binge eating since. Up and down in shape non stop. He acceptted it up till few years ago where binge eating took over and i put on extreme amount weight pretty quick in few years and i became pretty unhealthy. Im pretty tall lucky so its evened out over my body but im still alot heavy..

Anyway he started saying to me he was worried for my health and it wasnt healthy and i needed to exercise so we could go on walks together and i needed eat better and stuff and Didnt find me attractive anymore.

I agreed and i not happy how i looked or felt. I stopped binging pretty much at around xmas. Ive not binged once since. Ive lost alot weight. I wont say how much as im not sure a numbers allowed or not.

However heres the issue. My boyf says i look no different and recently text me saying i looked like id put all my weight back on and looked fat and unhealthy again. When what actually happened is id just been eating normally for few weeks for a break from loosing.i didnt loose or put on any weight in those two weeks.i staid exactly the same weight. In those two weeks i stopped reporting every other day id lost a bit weight to him. So i think psychology he made me fatter in his head?? After he sent that i cried and cried for ages. I felt my big weight loss had meant nothing if i still looked just how i did before.

If i eat he rolls his eyes and judges me for it. Which really doesnt help me.

I want to be healthy again but i still have binging urges constantly but im controling them but they are there daily.he has no idea how hard it is. He eats a big bar chocolate for pudding every day. I cant do that.

I have a few health disorders that make loosing weight harder too like pcos and underactive thyriod ect.

My mum saw me after not having seen me for multiple months and said i looked quite alot better. So i know it is visable and the scales dont lie. Niether do the photos.

I want to be healthy yes but i feel like theres alot pressure from my boyf and its making me feel really bad about myself. I should feel goid ive lost and im healthier. Im still classed as heavy so i have some more to loose but i should be pleased.

Loosing all i did isnt easy when inside you wsnt to binge so badly. I have so many in dealt with emotional issues. I just feel like i cant eat right now. Parts me is greatful because i want be healthier but part of me is really annoyed. Id like to enjoy having a snack and feel not judged about it once in a while.

Idk. I know he is just trying to help but it feels not so good sometimes. I dont know how to talk to him about it.

I used to be a big binger and I’ve dieted for what feels like half my life and I’ve never been happy about myself, but the last year I’ve started having to lie about what I’m eating because I know it’s not enough and it worries me So basically, I’m pretty sure I could stop at any time but I try to eat about xxx cals (extremely small amount) from when I wake up to until dinner where I eat just a normal dinner and then I don’t eat again till the next morning. I could eat more if I wanted to but I don’t want the extra calories, so I don’t. I know that I obsessively calorie count, I was really upset with myself the other day because I had a few squares of chocolate and found out it was x cals and I’d already eaten my limit for the day, i have a full list on my notes app of all the calories in different treats and food I like, to the point where I could tell you how much calories is in almost anything. I also weigh myself every morning - I know I shouldn’t but I can’t help myself, I need to know and it ruins my day if it goes up even by a 1/4 pound .

28,Request: Having trouble eating. Don't know what to do," 

I have never talked to anyone else about this before. I know I have an eating disorder. I had one when I was much younger and I know all the signs and tells of one. I just haven’t been able to talk to anyone about it because I don’t really want to recover, or at least, I don’t want to gain any weight.

About two years ago, I developed a stomach issue where I would be nauseated and vomit all the time. I lost a lot of weight but never hated the way my body looked before or after. I went to multiple doctors and about 6 months ago, I found a doctor who helped me get on track to recover. The only problem is, I now don’t want to gain anymore weight. The vomiting has decreased immensely, but now I feel as though I need to vomit in order to maintain my current weight. So I make myself vomit- even if I eat something as small as an apple and peanut butter, I feel full and grossed out by myself and try to make myself throw up.

I am trying to stop this eating disorder on my own because I honestly don’t think I can tell any of my friends or family. I just don’t want to tell them because even though I want to get better because it’s severely affecting my body ( I now have terrible GERD, am fatigued and light headed all the time, and am depressed because of it) I don’t want to gain weight because I love the way that I look now. I am so confident with myself and I haven’t felt this way for awhile.

So I just don’t know what to do. And I really don’t want to go to therapy for it or talk to anyone I know about it.

30,Request: How do you stop feeling guilty about eating?," 

Hey, I’m looking for tips. Basically, I don’t know if I have an ED and tbh I don’t think I do but I definitely need some help with some  healthy habits. How do you stop feeling guilty about eating? I have been restricting intensely for a long time now and this week I’ve had quite a few slip ups and I’m trying to move past it and pretend I don’t care but it’s eating me alive, I feel like I have to make up for it and that I’m disgusting. My sister made me a cheesecake, because i used to love eating it, and so obviously I had to have it, and I do love cheesecake and couldn’t control myself and I binged for about two days and now I’m so upset because I’ve probably gained so much weight. How do you guys move on and stop feeling so guilty?",if0tax,38,1.0,6,2020-08-23 10:14:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/if0tax/request_how_do_you_stop_feeling_guilty_about/,False,False,2020,8
31,Request: My girlfriend won't eat in front of me because she says she isn't comfortable. Worried she has an ED,"I started dating an amazing woman 5 months ago and I really see a future between us. She has brought up some mental health struggles and I always do my best to listen and talk to her about them. We have a very good communicative relationship and I would always say I'm very supportive of her. She says how being together has helped her a lot and she's very happy. She is in her mid/late 20s and looks to be very healthy. Every time we eat together, she barley touches her food. For example, we went to a very popular restaurant that is difficult to get reservations at. We ordered a burger and a pizza to split. When the food arrived, she had maybe 4 bites of the burger (I had to push her to eat some at all) and didn't eat any pizza. We brought some home and watched a movie after. She said she was hungry and wanted a slice, I heated it up in the oven and gave her one and then she took half a bite. It seems to be like this every time we eat together. Evertime I try to get her to eat more, she says it takes her time to get comfortable eating in front of someone. I try my best to let here know she should be comfortable in front of me. Last night, she brought up how she struggled with anorexia and bulimia in high school for a few years and stopped getting her period as a result. I am very concerned for her and want nothing more than for her to be happy and healthy. I really am trying my best to be supportive and there for her. It has started to create a lot of stress because like I said, I worry for her health. Last night she said she ""wished she could be skinny for me"". She is 5'3 and maybe xxx pounds (a normal and healthy weight). I told her how great she looked but she kind of shrugged it off. What can I say or do to be supportive and not judgmental to here? Does it sound like she still has an eating disorder?

32,Request: Scared i’ll never be able to live a normal life?,"for context, i’ve been anorexic/ bulimic for nine years. it started in 7th grade and i thought i’d leave it behind in high school after cheer ended....but here i am, 23 and feeling like this disorder is a life sentence. 

i’ve come really far in my recovery, haven’t purged in almost 3 months but it’s still always on my mind and causing problems in my relationships. 

the current drama is that one of my bf’s friends posted a group pic from a pool party literally from memorial day and i STILL am thinking about how bloated i look in the picture...the friend refused to delete it after i asked so i have to live with it being on the internet forever...

this makes me not want to be friends with this person of course, but i can’t help but feel like the bigger issue is that i’m still sobbing over a picture that was posted 3 months ago. 

things like this make me feel like i’ll never be able to live a normal life...if i can’t even handle an unflattering insta pic how will i ever handle real life? what if i endure an injury or illness in which i can’t exercise for a while? or how will i ever handle being pregnant one day? 

and i know it’s all in my head because i’m in the best shape of my life right now but i still can’t seem to ever love or accept myself....and all i can do is cry since i promised everyone in my life i wouldn’t purge anymore which was my coping mechanism for literally everything for so long so i don’t know how to deal with things besides crying and feeling hopeless. 

does it get better? can someone with any experience with recovery please tell me if i’ll ever be able to live a normal life? and how?",id7dne,34,0.93,8,2020-08-20 09:51:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/id7dne/request_scared_ill_never_be_able_to_live_a_normal/,False,False,2020,8

Sometimes he will eat a lot and do a binge then purge.
He is vomiting multiple times a week, almost daily, for weeks.
Im starting to get really worried. 

I tell him to brush his teeth after and wash mouth out as to reduce acid damage but I know its still bad. I tell him to not do it but he does it anyway. I buy healthy food and he still does it or binges on MY food then purges :(

He's on duromine to lose weight as he is overweight but at the rate he's going, probably not for long.

34,Request: idk what's happening to me,"For as long as I've known I've struggled with some sort of eating disorder but I've always been able to at least understand what I was going through but I don't know what to make of what is happening to me now. 

For the longest time I was bulimic and it went pretty hand in hand w my alcoholism, it became daily and euphoric to purge, I was obsessed with eating too. I loved food, the thought of food made me happy, eating made me dance, I ate whatever the hell I wanted and dealt with the consequences later but I still ate. I had an appetite. 

Earlier in January I quit drinking and smoking cigarettes and was trying to turn my life around, and as part of that, I also worked on my recovery with eating. I was still eating a lot, I started gaining weight, but I stopped purging. 

I don't know what happened to me recently and I'm not sure if this is due to medication I'm taking for my migraines and insomnia, but I became someone I didn't recognize. I've always struggled with different eating disorders but the common thread was that I was always hungry, I was always obsessing over food. I now have no appetite. Like none whatsoever, I usually go more than 24 hrs before I put something in my mouth and even then I can't get half way through the plate. This happened for over a month and then I realized I have been obsessing over my weight again, and I have been dropping weight faster than I ever have. People around me are suggesting that I'm falling back in to disordered habits again, some even saying anorexia? 

I went out yesterday with a friend because I haven't seen him since the quarantine and I felt so disgusted with myself not being able to order anything, eventually I ordered juice. I couldn't even get half way through it and then for the first time since January, I went to the the bathroom and purged out fucking juice.

I don't know if this means I'm bulimic again or if I'm anorexic because I never eat, I don't know what the hell I'm doing, this is the first time in months that I've been honest with myself about any of this because to everyone around me I've been calling it a ""restricted diet"" (mind you I wasn't binging before yesterday's incident so technically in my head I really convinced myself I was just dieting extremely)",i5at6b,35,0.95,4,2020-08-07 09:33:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/i5at6b/request_idk_whats_happening_to_me/,False,False,2020,8

I could spend hours
""coffee or tea?
hot or cold? what size?
if I want coffee then what coffee?
actually no,I want tea but do I really want tea?""
""do I want sweet or salty? do I want to eat meal? maybe I want bread but what kind?""
""that's good but that also looks good and so is that one""
""is this the right portion? one or two? no that's too greedy"" ""will I be satisfied after eating this have to get something else but then I'll get too full and sick"" and it goes on and on

not to mention that I need to make a whole scenario on how am I going to feel while eating the food,what it tastes like and how am I going to feel after then I keep repeating it over and over to make sure.
idk it's so fucking ridiculous 
I literally get extreme headache everytime
And when I'm at the convenient store people keep looking at me checking everything going back aisle to aisle and i spend so much time.

2,"Request: Need to lose weight, but every time I try I feel my disordered eating creeping up"," 

I'm a 22 year old woman that's struggled with various kinds of disordered eating over the years, and I'm trying to find the best way for me to lose weight.

I am obese. My doctors always really want me to lose weight, and I would like to as well. My problem is that every time I try, I feel my disordered eating creeping up.

I've been overweight since I was pretty young, and due to my parents pushing, weight has always been a focus of mine. Up until the past couple years I went through cycles of binging and purging with periods of excessive restriction and excessive binging in between.

When I try to use pretty stands methods, like just simply counting calories, I impulsively try to push the number lower, or get distressed and binge if I go over it.

While I've been relatively stable for a while, attempts at weight loss tend to throw me off and make me start a spiral, so I'm not sure where to begin. Therapy is not an option because of how much the co-pay is (and in my experience, therapy doesn't work too well for me. Since I'm undeniably overweight, my concern with weight loss tends to go overlooked).

Any suggestions? Books, websites, guides?

And I've never dated someone with an eating disorder before. I cook/bake a lot and I love making food for other people. Making food for others is how I express gratitude, appreciation, and love. I really like her and don't want to scare her off or make her think I'm not being supportive. Since we've been together ive dialed back a lot on the food talk because I get anxious that what I say might upset her.

5,Request: My fiancé said I look 'big boned' and have gained weight :(,"My fiancè is the type of person who says things without thinking first, which means he sometimes says something he doesn't really mean and meant to say another thing. 
Today we were chilling watching TV and I felt really unwell. He asked me if I could be pregnant again (we have a 2 month old baby already) as he had been noticing signs, but refused to tell me what signs as it would upset me. My heart immediately sank as I knew what that meant, and asked if I had gained weight. He told me that I had, and that I looked 'big boned'.

He knew from my face how incredibly hurt I was to hear that, especially as I have only recently started eating again after starving myself for a while after having a baby. He did feel really guilty and apologised many times, and said that it came out wrong and he didn't mean to say that. He really did feel awful about it and said he realised that it was something you shouldn't say to someone with a long history of eating disorders. But now I can't get it out of my head... Big boned. Gained weight. I mean, I've just had a baby, and I've been told many times how lucky I am that my body has slimmed down again so soon after. But obviously my fiance doesn't see that :(

I'm a big coffee drinker but today I haven't been able to eat or drink a thing since he said that. I don't want to eat ever again.

6,Request: my boyfriend's family takes it as an offense that i don't eat much,"hi! i (F19) live with my boyfriend (M21) and he's hands down the best partner i've ever had, ESPECIALLY in concerns to my recovery. he doesn't ask many questions, but whenever i have a boundary, he abides by it strictly, and he catches himself overstepping.

to keep this anonymous, i won't say where he's from, but it's one of those cultures where food is definitely a love language.

i've been struggling with bulimia since i was 15 and able to control what i ate and what i did with it. i was one of those girls that really seemed to just get more weight and curves overnight, and that was awful for me even without my mom's criticism, which inevitably sent me down that path. i was also addicted to working out, which was both something to do to get out of an awful house and something to punish myself.

now i'm at a healthier balance. i'm not perfect, by any means, but one of my things is that i keep track of what i eat. it's not obsessive for me, it's just something i can see at the end of the day and note that this is all the food i've kept down. i push myself every day, but i know when enough is enough.

my boyfriend's mother loves cooking for us, and my boyfriend understands that me eating everything she makes is, right now, out of the question for me. i really do try, you know? it's just that i see the amount of food there and my brain just tells me that i'm disgusting for even considering it and that i deserve the consequence of eating it. usually, it's not even a problem if i'm around the food in my apartment, because i have a lot of control now.

but if i'm at her house, it's just really hard to tell this sweet woman 'no' to almost everything.

she, my boyfriend's dad, and my boyfriend's sister ended up confronting my boyfriend about it, and said that my boyfriend's mom was really hurt because she thinks it means i don't like her food. to my boyfriend's credit, he tried to explain as much as he could without explicitly telling them i'm struggling, because he told me he thinks they'd either ask a lot of questions about it or they would walk on eggshells around me. this really devastated me, as i've never really had a family of my own and these people have been nothing but loving to me, and i really love them as well. i just don't even know what to say. they're from a country where an issue like this isn't necessarily a 'real' issue and is wildly untreated. is there anyone who was in a similar position? i don't even know where to turn now.",iwbeb9,84,0.98,13,2020-09-20 10:17:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/iwbeb9/request_my_boyfriends_family_takes_it_as_an/,False,False,2020,9

8,Request: My mother is constantly triggering my ED and I’m on the verge of relapse.,"I had gone into a outpatient program for eating disorder in October of last year. I was there for four months and I felt that I made tons of progress. I was able to, for the most part, stay away from the ED urges. My mother was part of my recovery, going to therapy with me once a week and such, but never seemed to care how much her words could trigger me. So now it’s September and my mother has been continuously making comments about her own weight, needing to diet, needing to stop eating certain foods, since the pandemic has broken out. I tell her every time she makes a comment like that, that it’s triggering to me, and could she please talk to someone else about these things.  For a while I was able to brush off the comments but now reaching 6 months of hearing these comments almost everyday I’m start to break, and quickly. I’m already going back to some of my old habits. I’ve told her that her comments, about foods, dieting, and weight, have hurt me and lead to me to falling into a really bad mental spot with my eating disorder again. She responded with “You can’t blame me, It’s not my fault that you aren’t eating the right things.” I know deep down she is referring to the meal plan I had back at my outpatient program, but it made me feel destroyed. She says I can’t blame her, but it is her fault I’m back here. Just like a big part of me having an eating disorder is from her. I’ve already purged once, and have been getting on the scale every morning. She claims she just forgets that she can’t say those things, but I know it’s just because she wants to tell some one about what she’s doing. 
I can’t stop thinking about my body, my weight, and what I can’t eat. My mental state has plummeted. It kills me that my mother is the cause, but she has always been selfish. 
I’m genuinely just at a loss.

but he’s recently gotten worse, i’m not going into detail but i can tell he’s gotten much worse and i’m worried, this twitter community is doing way more harm then good, he says it makes him happy to have a community but all they do is use thinspo and meanspo and him feel like shit about himself more.

i’ve been apart of toxic communities on tumblr before that make my mental health worse, i only got help after my account was deleted and i didn’t make another, but i feel like i’m stuck because i can’t help him, i don’t want to take away this community and resources but i want to help him.

14,Request: How to handle post-binge mornings," 

How do you guys handle that post-binge morning? I know I absolutely HATE waking up knowing I ate like an animal the day/night before. Seriously, I stay in bed as long as possible to avoid that mental fog, physical bloat and feeling like my skin is literally stretching to accommodate what my brain has convinced me is an extra 15 lbs. It SUCKS. I usually “punish” myself on days like this: restrict my eating and find a way to sweat/exercise as much as possible. It’s my way of purging without purging, but we all know that only perpetuates the cycle. So I’m looking for mental and physical alternatives. Anything work for you guys that you think I should try? Therapy has always been my go-to and still is, but sometimes the words of anonymous peers who understand your struggles can be just as comforting/healing.

15,Request: How to draw the line between low self esteem and an ED?,"TW: mentions of self harm

I feel like I should preface all of this by saying that I’ve never seemed professional help, for anything. Ironically (?), I’m too anxious to go to a doctor or therapist. I also have a hard time talking to people I’m close with.

Basically my issue is that I’m not sure if I just have really low self esteem and use food as a way to cope sometimes, or if I’m actually developing/already have an ED. 

I really hate my body the majority of the time. I suck in, I pull on my fat, etc. I’ve stopped going clothes shopping in stores because ever since puberty its been a miserable and genuinely triggering experience. I would stand in the fitting room and punch myself in the stomach until I had to sit down or pass out. 

I eat large amounts of food in private, when bored or need to be distracted, and am ashamed of what I do eat. I never purge or starve myself, but I feel guilty sometimes. I’m vegan (for ethical reasons, not dieting), and really only exercise when I’m feeling optimistic, but that quickly goes again as soon as I feel low.

Up until recently (last 6months?) I really didn’t think I had any sort of ED or was even at risk but now I’m not sure. I took the NEDA screening test and it said I was potentially at risk, but I’m still hoping for a more personal insight.

I don’t want to take advantage of this sub, so please don’t give this time of day if it’s not relevant. Ofc, not everything’s here, but these are the main issues.",iragbr,54,0.96,7,2020-09-12 10:47:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/iragbr/request_how_to_draw_the_line_between_low_self/,False,False,2020,9

Soon after that i got a sthomach flu and i was going long periods of time without eating and i started thinking ""this will be good for weight loss if i continue this i will lose weight."" So even after i got better i continued to go a while without eating but it still wasn't anything to bad.

Over the past few months I've began eating less and less and portion sizeing my meals. Now I'm going a day or more at a time without eating and every time i eat i feel guilty no matter what it is or how long I've gone without eating. I've started to take certain foods out of my diet and get nervous about eating certain foods and if i don't know how many calories are in the food I'm eating i feel very uncomfortable with it and get anxiety about it. People in my life have noticed and my doctor even told my parents she's concerd about all the weight I've lost.

21,Request: Getting things off my chest + advice (tw: suicide),"(sorry guys..... i'm really going through it lol...)

Hi friends :)
I'm writing this out of total desperation. I joined reddit a couple minutes ago just so I could get this mess called my life story off of my chest for the first time ever.

So to start, I am female, just turned 18, 5'10"" and xxx lbs (normal BMI range). I have been struggling with body image/ eating/ weight since 7th grade, puberty sort of kick-starting it all. I grew to my final height in about a year, which caused me to be hungry CONSTANTLY. I didn't think too much about it because my weight was consistent and I was getting plenty of exercise with school sports. 
Now we go to the beginning of ninth grade; the worst year of my life, the year I almost didn't make it through. 

Lots of changes this year. I had just moved to a new place, I went from a small neighborhood to a secluded farm 40 minutes away from town (which I didn't really mind.) A new school, a highschool  where I know absolutely no-one. A house that required almost 100k worth of renovations. And a bipolar mother who had been 3 months without her medication. And a father with extreme anger issues.
I cried every day for at least an hour. My parents would constantly scream and swear at each other, my father would break things, I was treated as a glorified punching bag for both of them during the heat of it. I should also mention my anxiety, social anxiety, depression and ADHD (only the depression has been diagnosed professionally.)  Who knew renovations could be so terrifying? I think it gave me ptsd, too. I never liked being yelled at as a child, but these days even a loud laugh from someone makes my hair raise and brings tears to my eyes.   
This is when I noticed my eating behaviors. It was always when the house was quiet, like I was terrified a fight would break out any moment. I would eat a lot. Tons. I would stop, get anxious again and then keep eating. Everyday. I think I took to this because it kept my brain and body busy, and the only thing I had to worry about was getting too full. It got much, much worse when highschool actually started. I was too scared to eat my lunch at school (isn't social anxiety the best?) so I would get home and binge for a while, continuing after dinner. Halfway through grade nine, the depression began to creep in. My parents were too busy trying to kill each other to notice I guess, the binging continued. My social anxiety was life threatening at this point. I was scared ALL day, everything made me jump, even walking in the halls. I would shake for the rest of the day after answering a question. I guess all this fear made me more hungry, because I was now binging until the verge of vomiting. I wanted to die. I was going to drown myself in the river at the front of my property, wearing my school bag full of books. One, so it would weigh me down, two, so my parents would know it was school  that pushed me to do it. 

I am holding TONS of probably important details back but I really don't want to be here forever, so I'll speed things up.

Basically, my dog (my best friend) kept me from killing myself, I realized leaving him behind was selfish and I would miss him in hell. I cried more, till I would vomit, my parents finally noticed and took me out of school. I slowed down on my binging and tried using exercise as an escape, and it actually worked. Feeling better now but the other side of depression took its toll on me. I was lazy, grumpy, unmotivated, and emotionless. Halfway through grade 10 and the reno is complete. My parents actually start to patch up their marriage; going to counseling, my mom started new meds and dad tried anger meds.  I am now failing grade 10. I don't want to die but I don't want to live, so I sleep. I go back to school for grade 11 as I have no other choice. Luckily, my depression ironically made me so numb that my social anxiety could not compete anymore. My binging doesn't really occur anymore, I spend most of my time working out. I feel a bit better that summer. My parents are doing ok and I rarely binge, yet I slow down on my exercise and start making tons of desserts and delicious food. I eventually became yyy lbs (just beyond normal weight range) by the start of grade 12.

Here is where I discovered my current problem; almost no self control around certain foods. It's really strange, when I bake cookies, for example, I end up eating the whole batch of them by the end of the day. For some savory things I do the same,  only if I really like them. I forgot to mention, I have always been late for class, almost everyday, because it is very hard for me to get dressed. I change 1000 times and just end up being angry or crying.  Still happens today. 
Really gonna speed it up now, we're almost there!! 

When quarantine started, I took the opportunity to shed some lbs. I didn't think I could do it, but I ended up getting to my current weight, xxx lbs. I exercised everyday and used an app to count calories. It took about 4 months but I was super proud of myself. I still had no control over ""yummy"" foods though; if I over ate I would stay up until 7am the next morning to starve myself. I could never be successful if dessert was brought into the house or if I went out with friends. I decide to stop my diet  because counting calories everyday was starting to become mentally draining for me.

Now we have reached current day. I have gotten used to the weight I am now and have started acting similar to how I was at yyy. I'm starting to hate how I look again. I always say my fat looks very unnatural, and I think how I gained weight influences this. I am not counting calories but watching my portions. I have been doing well until a couple hours ago, when my mother made chocolate chip cookies, I ate 6, meaning I cannot have dinner tonight. Worst part is, I injured my leg the other day and cannot run to burn it off.
 
If you have any advice for ""no self control ,"" please, please let me know. I just want to eat normally for once, I want to be able to enjoy something without any regrets or weight gain.

22,Request: Should I tell my doctor I think I have an ED?,"(TW-described eating habits) 

A little back story. I (17F) have been overweight for all of my life. I recently lost a lot of weight, like another person amount of weight. For the most part, it was healthy. However, when quarantine began I was eating very restrictively. I only ate at 5 p.m. This “meal” consisted of about 2 carrots, some broccoli, some frozen fruit and water. That’s all. After about a month or so, I began eating a little more. Then, I went to my boyfriends. (I stay at his place for the summer since we are long distance) Then I started to eat whatever I wanted, without care if I was hungry or not. I gained a few pounds and started heavily restricting again when I got back home. Fast forward to now, I’m in a binging episode. I ate 1 think out of my set calories for the day and believed that I had ruined everything. So I binged. I keep telling myself that I will start tomorrow, so I eat anything and everything I can that day. And the cycle repeats. Sometimes I will try to make myself throw up. However, this dosent work anymore as my reflex is too far back now.

I’m not sure if I have an eating disorder and I’m too embarrassed and scared to mention it to anyone. For example, my father is constantly telling me how proud he is of me for losing the weight. (Which makes me feel so incredibly angry inside for some reason) I just feel like he wouldn’t understand or would be sad/upset with me. 

What would happen of I were to tell my doctor? Would they have to tell my dad? Would they put me into some type of recovery place?

2,Request: Recovery is possible," 

Hi friends,

I want to share a bit of my story and I hope it will give you some hope. I developed my ED at 10 years old. I’ll spare you the details but it was a long, horrific and often unbearable 17 years that I suffered from my eating disorders. I did not receive treatment until I was in my 20s and once I started treatment it became an even more horrific fight for my life.

Eating disorders are no joke. They are dangerous, serious and deadly. I am saying this because I care about your life, your well being and your quality of life. Eating disorders suck everything out of you... I am not talking physically as we all know ED’s come in every shape and size - I am talking they take away your personality, friends, family, interests. They completely wreck your life and do so unapologetically.

After years of treatment I can proudly say I am recovered from my eating disorders. And I know you can too. If you need support, I’m here. If you need encouragement, I’m here. My hope for you is that you’ll find someone safe and reach out to them for help. It takes a village. It takes help. AND it is 100% ACHIEVABLE.

The issue I'm having is when she brought up she's self-conscious about her gaining weight, and I'm not sure what to say. Often she will say something like ""I think I'm gaining weight"" when she clearly isn't. Often more than not I'm in silence thinking of what I could say because I don't want to trigger anything for her. I know what not to say, I just don't know what to say back. I've looked around the internet and they just deal with what not to say. She's also taking a medication unrelated to her ED that lists a side effect of weight gain, and she tells me she's worried about gaining weight.

If anyone could help me help her that would be fantastic, cause I want to help her through her anxieties about weight gain.",jkucg5,80,1.0,19,2020-10-30 10:33:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/jkucg5/request_i_cant_find_anything_on_how_to_comfort_my/,False,False,2020,10

8,Request: How to cope with putting my pet on a necessary weight-loss diet,"This may be kind of an odd advice request, but I can't find any discussions about this particular scenario I'm dealing with online anywhere.

I've been dealing with atypical anorexia and compulsive overeating on and off for a few years now. Recently I've been meeting remotely with a dietician to try to keep myself on track to recovery during the pandemic. It's been going fairly well.

Today I took one of my cats to the vet and asked them about his size since he's been looking a little overweight compared to his brother. I've been raising him and his brother from kittenhood and they're finally getting to the age where we have to start worrying about overfeeding. The vet said he was in fact starting to get too heavy for his frame and recommended that we switch from letting the cats graze on dry food all day to having portioned, scheduled feeding.

As a lifelong obsessive cat lover and someone aspiring to a career in vet medicine, I understand full well that being overweight as a cat is far more unhealthy and dangerous than being ""overweight"" as a human. Our anatomies are not the same; we have different dietary needs. I trust that if our vet says my cat should go on a diet, then it is necessary to preserve his health, comfort, and happiness. And I am determined to do right by my cats.

This isn't a question of if I should restrict my pets' food intake, as I've already said I understand and trust our vet's professional opinion; it's a question of how I can cope with the feelings this stirs in me as a recovering eating disordered person.

I have to count calories for my cats. I may have to buy a scale to monitor their weight. And I have to push through denying them food when they're vocalizing that they're hungry because they've gotten used to being able to eat whenever.

All of this is of course very distressing and puts me at risk of relapse.

Does anyone out there have any advice for me to get through this? I love my cats and I want to help them, but I'm scared of harming myself in the process.",jc6x7i,76,1.0,6,2020-10-16 09:39:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/jc6x7i/request_how_to_cope_with_putting_my_pet_on_a/,False,False,2020,10

12,Request: Discussing Disordered Eating with Foreign Exchange Student,"My SO and I are hosting a foreign exchange student for the 2020-2021 school year. She is 15 and I am very concerned about her eating habits. I understand Americans eat larger portions and expected that she would eat less than we do. She's been with us 7 weeks now and I know it's been hard on her with virtual school limiting her social interactions with other teens.

I've noticed that she subsists mostly off milk and fruit. I make dinner from scratch 4-6 nights a week and she will take a small portion, but does not eat lunch. I have encouraged her to go through cookbooks with me to find recipes she wants to try. We have also baked a few desserts because she loves chocolate. My SO is in hospitality, so we go to restaurant openings and events sometimes - she does appear to eat better in public than at home.

Yesterday a bathroom scale arrived from Amazon for her. This, coupled with the calorie deficit, has pushed me to reach out to the foreign exchange coordinator to have a discussion with her tomorrow about our concerns. I am afraid that this will trigger her to eat larger portions in front of us and then purge. 

How can we have a productive conversation with her that doesn't trigger a new ED or exacerbate an existing one? I hesitate to call her parents and ask if she has done this at home or if this is a new control behavior she's developed here.",jed8bx,68,1.0,13,2020-10-19 23:09:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/jed8bx/request_discussing_disordered_eating_with_foreign/,False,False,2020,10

Suffice it to say, that was not sustainable and while I’ve refused to step on the scales for weeks now (I don’t think I could handle it) I know I’ve reached my starting weight, if not more. While I’m still not “happy,” one thing I’ve noticed is that I can eat a big meal and I don’t get a “pregnancy belly” since I’m not just skin and bones anymore.

14,Request: Having an ED and living with roommates,"I have had anorexia with bulimic tendencies for a almost two years now. It started after I gained weight my freshman year of college, which I didn’t even notice, until my ex’s friend accidentally sent a message to me talking about how much larger I look. That summer after freshman year I started the keto diet, this was kind of restrictive but I don’t believe my disordered eating started until I went back to school. When I realized I couldn’t keep up with only having x amount of carbs a day on keto, 
 I decided to switch to a traditional diet: caloric deficit. I re downloaded my calorie counting app that I got when I was 12 (think I had a brush with an ED then) and started religiously tracking everything I ate, and I haven’t stopped since. I was and am obsessed with calories, I would heavily restrict or try to go days at a time without food when I went “over” in calories, then those punishments led to horrible binge eating episodes followed by purging. I’m in a much different place now than I was a year ago, I would say a year ago I was at my lowest with my ED, and I have since been going to therapy weekly but i still actively have anorexia. A big component of my ED is secrecy, I know this is common from this thread so thank you for showing me I’m not alone, and it wasn’t until last week that I finally told someone what has been happening. I was high having a really deep conversation with my boyfriend and I just felt a sudden urge to blurt it out, he wasn’t shocked of course but offered his support and a shoulder to lean on. I felt obligated to then tell my two best friends, 1 I live with, the other I do not. The friend I live with is one of the most kind, thoughtful, helpful, compassionate, and generous people I know. She’s truly amazing, and when I told her about my ED she said she will love me enough for the both of us, I couldn’t ask for better support. But in her efforts to help me, with only the absolute best intentions, she has now been calling attention to what I eat frequently and in front of others. I know she just wants me to be healthy and happy, but I don’t know how to tell her that bringing attention to what I eat makes me want to hide in my room and not give food a second thought.",jfcbdy,67,1.0,5,2020-10-21 12:59:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/jfcbdy/request_having_an_ed_and_living_with_roommates/,False,False,2020,10

22,Request: How can I find Binge Eating Support (NOT oa)?,"Hi, I'm a man in his 30s looking for support with binge eating. I've tried OA support groups - they have many online Zoom meetings focused on men. But their approach is too black & white for me. I found the same with AA when I went there. I'm now 2+ years alcohol-free, but many of the same triggers which would induce drinking now just transferred to foods.

Almost all of the time I eat nutritiously. I don't track my food because it gets into ""unhealthy obsession"" territory. That's where OA fails me - any sponsor wants me to commit unwaiveringly to a strict portion-controlled plan, to the point of obsession. Then they say, ""Well are you committed to the plan or ARE YOU NOT?"" with this judgmental tone. (If you've had a good experience with OA or a 12-step program, I don't mean to diminish that. This is just what my experience has been.) Aside from that, I don't believe addiction is a disease or that the brain chemistry of alcoholics or compulsive eaters is hopelessly unchangeable and fundamentally different than ""normal"" people.

I do habitually eat whole, unprocessed, nutritious foods, mostly plant-based, and this serves me well nearly all of the time. I've already, slowly over the course of many years, developed long-term nutrition habits which work for me. I've even worked on mindfully noticing and honoring my hunger and fullness cues.

It's just the binges which are an issue, and the problem for me is emotional. It's those times when I feel anxious or out of control or frustrated or angry or overwhelmed or upset or hopeless. That's when I'd go out and buy a bunch of food that I wouldn't usually eat - processed, frozen, fast food, calorie-dense stuff. I know that it's an adaptive (maladaptive) coping mechanism to deal with unpleasant emotions. But I don't have it under control yet, and I feel like I'm alone in this battle.

Is there somewhere I can find some kind of sponsor-like support for this? Like someone to call when I'm feeling like I'm going to binge to talk me down off the ledge? Very few friends or family know about my binge eating. None of my guy friends do.

I just started seeing a new therapist and working through complex PTSD which came about as a response to childhood trauma. The binge eating certainly is a part of that, but it's not our focus in therapy, and I can't just call up my therapist any time I'm feeling like I need support.

26,"Request: partner developing ED, need help supporting them","My partner and I both live with our parents (we are in college) and mine will not let me visit my partner, so it's been almost impossible to have any sort of contact since the pandemic started. 
Recently my partner has been showing signs of an eating disorder. For the past month or two, they have been complaining of stomachaches and the feeling of wanting to vomit during a normal activity (e.g. when we were on the phone). Occasionally they would go a day or two without eating but then revert back to normal habits. 
Over the past couple of weeks, however, my partner has been going days without eating and having extremely small meals only once in a while. They told me that they feel disgusted by food, not because of dysmorphia or anything (or so I think) just simply the feeling of being grossed out by the sight or thought of food. My partner also said that the rare time that they feel hungry, they have to eat almost immediately or the ""window"" will close and they just won't eat. These past few days I've come to realize that my partner has always struggled with fluctuating weight and irregular eating habits, but it's just really reached a peak lately and my partner is down almost 20 pounds. 
I googled this and it seems like my partner may have an avoidant style eating disorder. I am at a complete loss for what to do. They don't have insurance, works minimum wage, and parents don't support them financially so going to a therapist or nutritionist is basically impossible.
I've been trying to encourage them to eat (not forcefully) and bring them food on the rare occasion that I am permitted to visit them at work, but there's only so much I can do when I don't live with them and the only way we can communicate is through a screen.

27,Request: Do I really have a problem?,"I've been overweight for nearly my whole life, but I've always had a not-so-great relationship with food. 

At the end of last year, I began taking a new antidepressant, and it suppressed my appetite for two or three weeks. I believe this is when it began to get worse. I ate normally after those weeks passed, but the negative self-talk got worse than it ever has been, as if my brain were saying ""you stopped eating before, don't go back.""

Then, in January, my partner was diagnosed with cancer, and almost died from a pulmonary embolism. It looks like they're going to be okay now, but from January to around August, that wasn't so sure. On top of that, I've been going to therapy and, while it has helped with some things, it's also painful - I'm bringing up things I've never talked about before and realizing just how badly I've been treated in the past. On top of that, college has been extremely difficult, unrewarding, and unsatisfying. And then there's the pandemic, and everything else. Everything just felt hopeless and, to an extent, still feels hopeless and out of control.

In March is when I really began to restrict, and since June it's been particularly bad. If I eat over my self-imposed calorie limit, I feel incredibly anxious and panicky. If my partner brings home any cakes or take out, or any outside food, or cooks for me, I want to cry because I know they expect me to eat it, and that they're just being sweet, despite not having to at all - so I eat it, and I hate myself for it, and I hate myself for hating myself. My partner regularly comments on how little I eat, ""like a bird"". I tell them I'm fine, just not so hungry today, but it always strikes fear in me that they're gonna figure it out eventually.

I count calories obsessively, weigh myself everyday, and I've lost a significant amount of weight since January (still overweight, though, so no one seems to notice, besides my partner.)

I feel tired all the time, I get shaky, it's hard to concentrate, especially on school. I'm constantly thinking about food and planning out my meals and trying to make sure I count every single little thing. I'm always anxious to eat around others, and I've been noticing bruises on my legs where I've bumped into things that, before, never gave me bruises. I enjoy the feeling of an empty stomach, even when it hurts, because it makes me feel like I'm finally accomplishing something, that this, at least, I can control, and I can control well. Every day, I try to get away with eating as little as possible.

My therapist has brought up the possibility of receiving extra treatment from someone who specializes in eating and eating disorders, but I'm extremely hesitant. I know what I'm doing isn't good, exactly, but it's hard to think about it being a big enough issue to receive extra treatment for - that I'm not sick enough for that. ""I'm overweight anyways, and I have to lose weight anyways, so what's the problem?"" my brain says. I think I'm too scared to face the reality of what's happening to me, and what I'm doing to myself. I think I'm ashamed. It's hard to tell how bad off I really am, because I tend to minimize my own experiences.

28,Request: I booked a visit with a therapist and now I'm afraid I'm just wasting her time.," 

I booked a visit with a therapist and now I'm afraid I'm just wasting her time.

In my country the person that diagnoses you, gives meds, etc. is the psychiatrist. So a week ago I finally booked a visit, and now I'm having huge doubts. I don't starve myself all the time. I don't purge and vomit all the time. I weight within healthy range. In fact right now I'm in sort-of a good streak. I'm counting calories and sort-of sticking with the plan. But there were times when I was starving myself, there are times when I'm purging. I love the feeling of an empty stomach, there's a chance never weight enough to feel satisfied, I always look at what everyone else around me is eating and trying to eat less. I feel like a disgusting blob, I compare myself to everyone. And I don't remember the last time I wasn't trying to or thinking about trying to loose weight. But I'm so scared that all of this is just simply lack of strong will or me being overdramatic. I don't want to waist anyone's time and I'm afraid of hearing that I'm just making up my problems",jemesi,34,1.0,7,2020-10-20 09:53:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/jemesi/request_i_booked_a_visit_with_a_therapist_and_now/,False,False,2020,10

2,Request: I ruined my relationship with food and I regret it,"&#x200B;

For context, it all started just before quarantine. I (F16) started restricting what I eat and I learned about calorie counting. Stupid me started eating very low calorie, even though it's not as low as some people go. I was extremely obsessed with food. When I went to sleep I thought about what I would eat in the morning, I would even try to count the calories for the next day in my head. In school I was always tired, hungry and cold and I couldn't stop thinking about food. I would spend way too much time at the grocery store comparing labels to get the most low calorie option. I would weight every gram of food I ate. And of course during the quarantine I had alot of free time and I would exercise for 2h per day, sometimes even more. All that went on for about 3 months, I lost some weight and ended up losing my period. I started binging uncontrollably and got my period back. I would find myself in the kitchen, binging on sweets. I started buying large amounts of sweets, for example a bag of cookies, a chocolate bar and a bag of candy and I would eat all of it at once. I would always think to myself ""this is my last binge, I'm getting back on track tomorrow"". But every day I would just wake up and have an extreme need to binge. I binged every day, stopped working out and gained more weight than I had lost. During summer I kind of got back on track, started working out again and tried to eat healthier .

But now I just don't know what to do. It feels like I can't just eat normally. I don't restrict and I don't binge as much as I did before, but it happens sometimes. I overeat almost every day and even the smallest restriction triggers me. I'm addicted to sweets and I need to have some everyday. I am of course worried for my looks because like any teenager I am abit insecure with my body but I am even more worried about my health. I can't imagine all the damage I did to my health with the restrict/binge cycle and with the large amount of sweets I eat every day. I wish I could go back in time and stop myself from restricting what I eat. I wish I could eat like normal people do, in normal portions.

I've only talked about this with one friend but not in too much detail. I don't know if I had or have an eating disorder because sometimes it seems like it wasn't serious enough to be considered as one. Please help me if you know how to rebuild my relationship with food and stop always overeating. Does anyone relate to this situation?

TW: Suicide and Self Harm.

Over the past month and a bit, I moved to university and began to lose my appetite as well as seeing a degradation to my mental health. There was one night where I binged a whole bunch of snacks and then felt an urge to throw it all up, which I resisted. Recently, my suicidal thoughts have become overwhelming and I've started starving myself as well as not taking the medicine that prevents me from bleeding out when I menstruate.

6,"Request: Post request. starved as a child, now always hungry.","When I was young (4-13) my father had custody of us. He bought drugs and alcohol, but rarely food. He often sold his foodstamps, so my brother and I walked home with food from the church and that was often our only way to eat, aside from hot dogs and bologna. 

I remember eating pebbles, lemon grass and clover flowers... I shoplifted and stole bird seed from the neighbor's feeders. I often traveled in search of food outside, even dumpster diving at the stores. Summers were rough, because that was the end of school lunches. 

When I was 13, mom got custody... Which was for the best! I was finally safe! But we both tried to make up for years lost, in food. She knew we went though hell so she'd get us whatever we wanted to eat. I was eating huge amounts of food, any hour of the day/night. I could sit and eat 4 packs of ramen, my own medium pizza even. It was never enough. My brother and I even started fighting over food when things got a bit scarce. I tripled my weight in a couple years.

Now I'm 27, I've attempted to get help over the years of therapy, but I still have food insecurity. I've become severely diabetic and the injections aren't helping. 

My doctor has told me I need to go vegan... Has told me to cut my plate size. Told me to limit myself. But has also told me she doesn't want to help me in ways until I ""try harder"" and lose weight. 

I've cut my eating in half- even moreso. I don't eat after 10pm (my husband gets off work at 10pm, so I can't eat sooner) I cut all sweets and don't drink any sugar. My doctor doesn't believe me. She suggested getting the belly band, but only if I ""try harder"".

Today I ate grapes for breakfast, 2 slices of pizza for lunch, and carrots and lite ranch for a snack. My sugar is WAY HIGH... (Typical)

I just don't know what to do. I'm so hungry, I have no energy, no self esteem... I was doing better when I was going to physical therapy and getting my spine injections, but haven't gone since the virus got worse (my community is anti science, anti mask. A lot of cases)

7,Request: Should I let my recovering daughter buy a scale?,"This may seem obvious to some but allow me to explain. For the last two months, my adult daughter has been trying to adhere to a weight-restoration diet as well as seeing a doctor via telehealth once every two weeks in order to treat her anorexia. She seems very unhappy, but she still adheres to her meal-plan for the most part. The days of her appointments, she is supposed to weigh herself, so I’ve reluctantly agreed to let her keep a scale in her bathroom. 

Well, today our scale broke, and I wouldn’t hesitate to buy a new one for the doctor’s measurements if I didn’t feel like my daughter gave me so many reasons to pause. For example, how did she realise the scale was broken on a day she isn’t allowed to weigh herself? Furthermore, when I said I would “wait and see” about buying another one, she started crying, begging me to understand how much she “needs” a scale. She’s also been losing a little bit of weight over the last two weeks, so I’m concerned she’s measuring her weight then compensating for her diet in some way. After all, she admitted a few days ago that she was hoping the target weight set by the doctor would turn out to be an “overestimation” 

I don’t know, should I replace the broken scale if she’s this upset about it?

14,Request: Am I displaying subtle signs of a possible eating disorder / body dysmorphic behaviour?,"I come from a pretty size-attuned culture where thinness is a huge thing. If you’re not Asian-sized skinny, then you need to lose weight. 

Weight talk is a thing where I’m from. Everybody seems to be allowed to have an opinion on your weight, your size, how you look, and how you *should* look — family, relatives, friends, classmates, even colleagues. Diet fads are a thing. Metabolism pills, herbs, coffees and teas are widely used. We have a whole “healthier choice” movement and if you’re not trying to engage in it, then you’re not trying hard enough to be healthy. We are BMI-obsessed. Clothes go up to an Asian large, but go down to an Asian xx-small (because xs isn’t small enough). 

And I’ve struggled with my weight a lot. The first time I thought I was disgusting, I was 8 — wearing a dance leotard and a skirt for a dance competition, thinking my arms were huge and that my stomach was literally bulging out and spilling over my skirt. I looked like any normal 8’yo girl, like the pics you’d find on google, but I felt disgusted with myself, at that young age. My mum had said something along the lines of “your tummy looks quite big in this costume” and so I assumed I was fatter than everyone else. 

Things have since worsened, of course. Put simply, jokes made by relatives like “I saw a really big-sized person downstairs, I didn’t know it was actually (my name)!” / “wow you look really ugly in this photo!”, comments by my parents like “you need to exercise more” / “if you exercised more your joints wouldn’t hurt” / “don’t eat dinner anymore, and don’t eat your whole lunch” / “stop eating rice or noodles, it’s so much carbs” / “you really put on weight, are you planning to do something about it”, classmates: “wow she has a fat belly” (i was eleven and at a healthy weight), colleagues: “you would look prettier if you were skinnier” (i’d just lost some weight after going on a no-carb diet, and still wasn’t skinny emough), these comments from other people just made me feel so sick of myself. And eventually, the thoughts became my own. If no-one else was saying it to me, then I’d be saying it to myself.

Across the years I’ve engaged in food restricting behaviour (calories restriction / skipping meals / starving myself when i felt hungry), partook in diet fads like liquid diets (only soups), water-only diets (only mineral water and a handful of diet pills a day, no food at all, marketed as a “body cleanse”), and diet pills like garcinia cambogia carb-blocking supplements. I used creams like slimming gels & fat-burning creams locked in with cling wrap. I went for slimming programs like toasting myself in a machine meant to “sculpt”, and then had to sit in a sauna for 30 minutes to “sweat the fat” out of my body. I used to be obsessed with exercise workouts. Not one message I sent wasn’t about some kind of workout routine or challenge. I was obsessed with making my body look a certain way. I weighed myself day in and day out, and the slightest weight gain would leave me feeling terrible. I would try to puke, or try to give myself food poisoning just so that everything that went into my body would come out — I never binged, but I needed it to not stay in my system. When i couldn’t make myself purge in that manner, I turned to taking laxatives on a daily basis for a substantial period of time. Despite everything I did, the numbers still climbed (despite some occasional dips). 

And every single time I ate more than I felt I would have to “pay it back” by starving myself and skipping / rationing meals.If my stomach shrank, so would my appetite.And I had a crazy amount of appetite to be honest, I was always dancing. And I would get told (even when I was dancing 6 days a week for hours at a time), that I still wasn’t exercising enough and needed to do more — I was barely at home at this point and was getting increasingly burnt out; I stopped dancing once I hit my limit. 

And then I eventually felt so bad about my body that I would cry looking at myself in the mirror before a shower, and squeeze my flab and claw at it. I wanted to take a slicing knife and cut it all off. I stopped weighing myself. When I lived abroad alone I stopped restricting my eating, ate whenever I felt empty (emotionally because I was getting depressed, but mistook it for physical hunger) and put on a ton of weight. When I came home from abroad I didn’t want to meet anyone at all for any “welcome home” meet-ups. I didn’t want to celebrate festivities. All I wanted to do was sleep and die alone out of embarrassment. I didn’t need to hear the comments because I already felt that way myself. 

I couldn’t & still can’t look at myself in the mirror and in pictures without feeling gargantuan. I feel like I’m taking too much space in this world, because I’m not small in clothing sizes. If my bum has to squeeze past someone else in the aisle of a crowded bus, it’s because I’m fat. If I brush shoulders with the person sitting beside me on a train, it’s because I’m fat. Nothing looks good on my body. My nose is too big for my face. I assume that I’m twice the size of my friends. I still check my body in the mirror everyday. I body-check my wrists. I have a terrible relationship with my body, myself, how I look, my clothing sizes, fitness, exercise, diets, expectations in general (because I was never slim enough, never exercised enough, never lost enough weight).

These days, I’ve started weighing myself again since having to attend monthly psychiatric appointments for moderate-severe depression. I’d been losing lots of weight after eating very little for months, due to depression’s poor appetite. And recently I’ve gained a very tiny bit of weight that I had lost, after starting to eat breakfast and a fuller lunch again because I started going back to work / existing outside of my house again. And the super tiny weight gain has had me reeling. I kind of made a competition with myself to lose more and more weight each time I went for the appointments — if I didn’t weigh lighter than the last appointment, then I was a complete fat fucking failure. 

I’m not at a healthy weight per my BMI. I carry quite a bit of muscle from my dancing days. My recent weight gain puts me back in the Obese category. It makes me sick. And I still do this thing where if I ate a small breakfast for the day , then I could only eat half my lunch and couldn’t let myself eat dinner — if I was hungry in the evening, I would have to make friends with gastric pains and mineral water. I’m doing it right now tbh. 

And I hate it. I hate having this constant balancing scale going on in my head — so much compensatory behaviour. I’m sick of myself. I feel like my brain and my body are both conspiring against me, with these body image obsessed thoughts and depression (outside of body image) and all. I feel worthless. I hate how I look. I hate how I’m always thinking about compensating for portions that I eat (even if food and calories aren’t on my mind 24/7). 

At this point I don’t know if it’s just my internalized asian fatphobia towards myself (I’m body-positive with all of my friends and family, but am very hypocritically the opposite with my own body), or if I’ve really been taking it too far with my weight management habits. I never thought that I had an eating disorder because I was overweight (because maybe it was normal to feel this way about a body that wasn’t the ideal average-looking skin?), but after becoming more aware of eating disorder stories by athletes / dancers / figure skaters recently, i find myself identifying with so many of their stories leading up to getting treatment for an ED, right down to rituals, habits and thoughts. Gracie Gold is basically the olympic athlete version of my own experience with my body. 

I don’t know, am I displaying subtle signs (or maybe glaring signs) of a possible eating disorder? Or are they just disordered eating habits? Do I need help? Where is the line between normal weight management vs. probably needing to see a professional for eating-related issues? 

I see my psychiatrist this week, and have been thinking about highlighting this body image issue with her, but I’m worried that she’ll say “well it’s because you’re clinically obese, it’s normal to want to lose weight”. But I may bring it up to her if someone can convince me that I actually should. I’m just tired of feeling like this.

I know I can be a hand full and I appreciate the time he was there to help me get better when I was being upset. If I look back on the first year, I was being really irrational. I feel like I’ve broken him at this point, I wanted to get better and went into therapy this year. I’m following DBT, going weekly to a psychologist & (since recently) a dietitian. I’m really trying and I’m doing better with handling my emotions and conversations but I get no more support from him especially with my ED. This makes recovery so hard for me, if I’m having a hard time he just ignores me and eventually just leaves. I try to make up for the times I’m upset but it’s just not enough anymore. The distance keeps getting worse and I’m stuck cause he doesn’t know how to help even though I’ve told him exactly how he can help. It just doesn’t happen. I can’t do this alone, especially since I feel like I’m being judged by him and the people around me but I’m at a breaking point. I’m thinking of breaking up, since I feel like it’s the best for both of us. He’s clearly not happy anymore but I feel like this relationship needs to go both ways and he’s pushing me down further. But I would still like some advice, I don’t wanna be unreasonable but I’m tired of trying and getting no support from his end.",jqkr2c,43,1.0,7,2020-11-08 22:09:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/jqkr2c/request_no_support_from_boyfriend/,False,False,2020,11
17,Request: My husband has lost a lot of weight due to medical problems and it’s starting to effect my recovery,My husband has had ongoing undiagnosed medical problems for about a year that have caused him to not be able to eat a normal amount of food and certain types of foods. He has lost a lot of weight and now weighs only a few pounds more than me. I have been in recovery from my ED for about three years and have been at a healthy weight but his weight loss is starting to trigger my ED thoughts again. I’ve always had this distorted idea that I have to be much smaller than men to be attractive and to feel confident about myself and his weight loss is making me feel insecure about myself and unattractive. I’m beginning to want to restrict and over-exercise again and I’m really struggling. My husband has mental health problems as well and I think part of his mystery physical illness is mental and maybe an ED. I just feel really triggered and I have worked so hard on my recovery and to feel confident at my healthy weight and I don’t know what to do... any advice is greatly appreciated.,k25kf4,42,0.97,2,2020-11-27 17:33:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/k25kf4/request_my_husband_has_lost_a_lot_of_weight_due/,False,False,2020,11
18,Request: worried about my girlfriend and her eating.," 

I’m (20 NB) am worried about my girlfriend (19 MtF) and her eating.

For some background, My girlfriend is a pre-transition trans woman. she came out as trans a few years ago, but she hasn’t been able to go to any sort of therapy. At first, this was because she couldn’t afford it. Now it’s because she not only is a full time student, but also works full time. She is hypoglycemic (I don’t know if this is diagnosed by a doctor, but she said she had hypoglycemia). She also has quite a bit of trauma related to her upbringing. She volunteered at a hospital for many years, and grew to believe that it is rude to eat in front of other people. She also believes it is rude to ask someone for food, or to take a second helping of food at a meal. I often have to make her eat by eating with her. (This is a problem for me, because I have gastric sleeve surgery, and can not eat a lot of food.) Often when she eats at my house, she will only take a small amount of food and later mention that she was hungry, but then when I try to get her to eat she refuses.

She’s never been great about eating enough, but she recently got a new job where she is less active, and someone made a comment that she had started gaining a small amount of weight. Since she has started this new job, it has become even harder for me to get her to eat, and on days that we are not together (because of her schedule, i only really get to see her on weekends), she will mention that she has only eaten 1 or 2 things through the day.

Today we were talking on her way to work, and she mentioned that she was hungry and that she hadn’t eaten all day. I told her she should stop and get something to eat, as her work wouldn’t be upset if she was a few minutes late (and they wouldn’t be). She said no, and that her work ethic is more important her her than her health. I offered to send food to her work so she could eat during her break, but she told me not to, saying that she wouldn’t be allowed to bring it in and that she was fine.

I brought up that I was worried about her eating, and she denied it. In her eyes, she thinks that she eats in a healthy way. I don’t know how to help her. I’m worried one day she’s going to go too long without eating and faint while she’s driving or woodworking. How can I show her that she isn’t being healthy?",jtevhg,40,0.95,3,2020-11-13 10:36:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/jtevhg/request_worried_about_my_girlfriend_and_her_eating/,False,False,2020,11

20,Request: What is the right amount to be eating?," 

 I (20F) am not officially diagnosed, but I acknowledge that I have an unhealthy relationship with food. I spent a lot of time at home since quarantine, and my parents made awful comments about my weight and called me a lot of names. Korean standards are severe. I was a healthy weight, probably considered thin still. At first I started exercising for myself, but it slowly turned into restricting because I wanted the exercise to have more effect, and I did not want to hear the comments anymore. I lost a decent amt of weight before leaving for school - was still a healthy weight. I didn't have to hear the comments, but it started becoming a fear of what they would say when I came back from school. I started mentally counting calories and on an app, and if I knew that I was going out or eating a lot on some days, I would plan for it ahead of time. I didn't have access to a scale, so I didn't know I was losing a lot more. So, when I got home, it both felt really good and horrible to hear my parents saying that I got very thin and to see it on the scale. I know that I should be talking to a therapist, but the school one that is free and one that I wouldn't have to tell my parents about cannot practice on zoom because I don't live in the state I go to school in. My parents believe that only psychotic people go to therapy so telling them is not really an option and they have expressed before how embarrassing it is to see other kids go because it means the parents failed. I have expressed to them before that I absolutely do not appreciate comments about my weight, but they see it as a joke. I have told my bf and some friends, so they are really helpful to talk to, but most of the journey rests on me. Real therapy/help is not really an option until I go back to school in two months, but I do not want to lose more weight and want to be more stable until then. However, I have genuinely no concept of what is enough food, because I thought I was doing better in eating the last month, only to have lost more. So what is an average day of eating look like for someone that is 5 4' and does anyone have any suggestions as to what I can do? Is counting calories to see if I am getting enough food a bad idea?",k25gsw,39,1.0,7,2020-11-27 17:28:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/k25gsw/request_what_is_the_right_amount_to_be_eating/,False,False,2020,11
21,Request: Post request: how can I stop binging/purging when I’m stressed?,"hello. So, my problem started developing when I was a young child, (I’m not diagnosed because I have never told anyone about my mental health, but I’m certain this is an eating disorder) basically, my family grew up very very poor, so we rarely had any food in the house. This situation did get better over time and a few years before I was a teen, we had food pretty much all the time. But we were still going through a lot of drama/trauma, and several family deaths. So, i ate. I guess it was comforting thinking “atleast I have food”.  I started gaining and it caused horrible bullying, but I couldn’t stop eating because it gave me comfort. So I started purging. This quickly resulted in my binging severely when I had any kind of stress/ any other kind of emotion that I didn’t like. So I would binge and purge several times in a single day, then I started restricting so I wouldn’t gain, then I got scared that I couldn’t have food so I would binge again and just start the cycle over again. I’m an adult now in my own place, and unfortunately still struggling. Not as badly, but it’s clearly still a problem. Anytime I have even a minor argument with anyone, someone is sick, something going on at my school, something at work, my immediate reaction is binge and purge. Again. I hate myself for it,  but I still can’t stop. I’ve tried everything I can think of but I always end up back in that horrible place that I just have to. I hate myself. I have to stop this.

I have been dealing with boulimia for quite a few years. I went from a healthy weight to underweight to sort of a healthy weight a lot. My habits, as you can imagine, have been less than healthy.
A couple of months ago I started treatment for my eating disorder and while that’s going okay and I am slowly starting to get healthier habits in regards to food, my weight is also increasing and I am now overweight, something that makes me incredibly insecure. The goal of the treatment is to maintain healthy eating and/or exercising habits and is less focussed on my weight.

But at 2am, I get an appetite and want to eat. Now, because I'm getting tired and don't feel like cooking, it usually gets me binging junk food with beef jerky being the healthiest.

Whats weird as this has been going on since Covid. Not that I have Covid but since it started fairing up in March.

What can I do to stimulate my appetite during the day?

My appetite is so drained I literally can't salivate enough to properly swallow and it takes me a long while to force myself to eat.

26,Request: How do I help my GF balance her recovery & her body image,"  My (25M) Gf (23F) of a year and a half has struggled with her ED for many years now. Ever since the start of 2020/lockdown she started to gain some weight, it was never really any issue, if anything a healthy sign of her recovery, or so I thought. We live about an hour away from each other, and at one point this summer I learned that her mother (who she lives with) had checked her into inpatient care for her ED. Apparently she had stopped eating altogether. She was in the facility for only about a week before she moved back into her house. Since then however she has again gained a little bit of weight, she no longer fits into a lot of her old clothes, and this has extracted a heavy toll on her mental health, body image, and overall sex drive. 

  We've had many conversations about ""why the weight doesn't matter"" but in all honesty I'm out of my area of expertise here. I've suffered with weight gain issue myself in the past and have offered to help with workouts/finding physical activities we can do that might be a fun way to use our bodies. But we keep running across the same issue where she claims she can't go down that path since it's damaging to her ED recovery. However we've now gotten to a point where she has stopped showering due to not wanting to look at her own body and how it's changed. 

I feel like she is caught between a rock and a hard place, where on one side she is scared of falling back into her ED, but that's pushing her into a direction where she can't stand her own body. I don't really know what I can do to help her. I can't accept that we're just stuck in this vicious cycle, but I don't know what I can do to break her out of it.

So many people continue their disordered eating habits because we usually see the weight loss and body shape changes long before we experience any symptoms of the serious damage we’ve caused. The immediate pay off seems to overshadow the long term issues we’re warned about. I know for me, I didn’t see anything bad happening and being so young I couldn’t even comprehend fully what it meant to be creating *eventual* damage.

So I have binge eating disorder. Or at least I assume so, I was talking to a therapist prior to the Covid closure about my bad relationship with food.

My only issue is that everyone in the ED community seems to be suffering with binging along with and additional disorder, commonly anorexia.

I understand their struggle. They have a very dangerous ED but I feel like I can't relate to their stories. I do not think I have food guilt. That's is what I most often see people mention. Instead I describe my relationship with food like a toxic relationship. When I'm stressed or sad I go to food because I'm seeking comfort and temporary happiness.

8,Request: I don’t look “sick” so no one will take me seriously. How do I stop feeling like an imposter? How/where do I get help?,"I recently saw a post on social media describing what it was like (for that person) to have ARFID. Their description sounded similar to my life so I went on Google and did some research on that as well as selective eating disorder. It sounds fucked up but when I learned about selective eating disorder I felt relieved and happy because I have always just been ashamed of my very severely “picky” eating habits. I finally felt heard and hopeful that maybe I can eventually become a normal eater.

I told my doctor hey I think I have this, so can you refer me to somewhere that will officially diagnose me and then help me with the treatment plan? And she looked at me like I was insane. To her credit, she simply asked why I thought I had it and then said she would have her assistant find somewhere for me... but she still gave me a look like why are you making this up, you’ve never said anything about this before and your weight and everything is normal.

Fast forward a few weeks and the assistant sends me the numbers to a couple general therapy places. Even though I don’t want that, I gave them a call and they said they didn’t have openings for months into next year. Fine. I get back to her and ask if I can do an outpatient program somewhere because I don’t think therapy will help as much as having someone qualified with eating disorders making a plan and working with me. No response for several weeks now.

(INFO: yes I could do research and find somewhere on my own but it is such a hassle to find places your insurance will accept. I thought it would be easier for the doctors office to do it since they probably have a list of places like that just in case any patient needs to go, and they already have my insurance information so they could just shoot me a list of places they recommended that take my insurance. Apparently that’s a no go though)

So what should I do?

10,"Request: My life is a mess, I do not think and act normal.","Hey everyone!
Well, here I am, almost two years since my ED started. First I was just ortorexic, than the things escalated and I became an anorexic. I had a lot of physical problems, but I was happy with my skinny body. Now I am no more underweight and I’m a binge eater- I feel like I’m the biggest failure in this world.
Oh God, I know it is wrong, but I miss the times, when I was underweight. It is not okay, I know, but I can’t control my brains and my body. That was the only period of my life, when I was not ashamed of my body. Now I feel fat, I have an acne because of the large amount of stress, I cry every single day and I do no believe that this nightmare will end.

Does anyone have or had similar problems?

There was a brief period of time when I was a healthy weight, and even though I achieved it through accidental starvation (I was overworked and never had a minute to sit down) I was finally happy with my appearance. Now, I've lost my job and started doing a lot of artwork, so I've gained back all of the weight I lost (and it was a lot) and I am miserable. Every bite of food I take makes me feel guilty. Every single bite. I end up trying to wait until later in the day to eat so I have less possible time to consume food, but I always end up binging. But I also don't feel like I can say ""I have an eating disorder"" because it's purely an emotional feeling. I just feel guilty and shameful when I eat anything.

13,Request: Should I give ED treatment a shot?," 

I’m in my first year of grad school and have been going through many stress related issues. One of those issues is an extremely low appetite where I often find myself skipping meals or taking an entire day to eat a sandwich. The appetite issues are just one of many stress symptoms.

I scheduled an appointment with our school counseling center and went through a few screenings to find out what type of care I need. I was surprised out of all the issues I came to talk about, they seemed to focus very heavily on the food issues. Which like I said, in my opinion, is stemming from severe anxiety issues from grad school.

The counseling center has decided my best course of treatment would be to get help from the Emily Program. I had never heard of it, but they apparently specialize in ED treatment and I could do outpatient care in my city.

I’m just really surprised by this and I’m tempted to dismiss it. I truly don’t believe an ED is my problem, although I see how some of my stress symptoms appear this way.

I’m just curious on peoples thoughts. Should I give this a shot? I know fixing the eating problems will reduce the stress in my life, but doesn’t feel like the real problem. Mg appearance hasn’t changed, if anything I’ve gained quite a bit weight because of the weird eating patterns. Or do I need to be more open minded about what an ED looks like?

My doctor says I need to recover as quickly as possible if I want to start working out again (for my own enjoyment of course) but gaining weight is really triggering me and it leads to me having breakdowns almost every night. I take medication, and this medication I take makes my hunger cues come very often, which is quite hard to ignore so I respond to them normally. I know this isn’t considered over eating but honestly I’m not sure anymore, I just try and eat until I’m full, but ever since a young age I’ve always been a hungry kid, so I eat ALOT. Then I usually skip some meals the next day which I know is very unhealthy, it’s just going to lead me in an endless loop... is it normal for me to eat until I’m full/satisfied?

so the low down, at the start of quarantine I started to get into some really bad body image issues and it was no fun so i decided, like an idiot, to start counting calories, and at first it was fine. Then i got a fitness tracking watch and starting doing regular exercise which is great but it started small (30 mins a day of light jogging, an hour of dancing, youtube workouts, etc) but noes it’s rigid 2-3 times a week strength training and 50 minutes of intense cardio a day + an extra 2 hour walk. I feel bad if i don’t complete my rings or walk around for a certain amount of time. because i wasn’t super strict with tracking i just exercise a shit ton to try and add a small overestimation of calories.

18,Request: Question: has anyone ever experienced distorted eating in relation to anxiety?,"I struggle with anxiety and often when I feel anxious enough, I tend to not eat very much at all - well below what I should eat in a day. It's like I feel sick and can't bring myself to each hardly anything at all. This occurs at a varying rate, depending on my anxiety but when it happens, it can last for a few days to even a couple of months. I don't have any issues with food normally, or have any particular body issues or dysmorphia. I am a pretty small person, though, and not eating hardly anything for even a couple of days can make me drop in weight, which I don't desire. 

To sum it up, I essentially have some sort of distorted eating that occurs as a side effect of anxiety and it's noticeable and concerning enough for me to be seeking advise. Has anyone ever experienced something like this?

I have been in therapy for awhile now and my therapist doesn't seem to be that concerned about it or at least thinks that if we can help my anxiety we can fix my eating patterns. I'm wondering if it's more than that, though.

19,Request: Seeking advice on dealing with body insecurity with boyfriend,"As background, I am currently 25 (f) and I’ve always had a relatively unhealthy relationship with food and frequently have done very restrictive diets for short periods of time then gained weight back and repeated this cycle starting from when I was around 12. After college I gained more weight and I was never super overweight but just on the thicker side- like at the max weight for a “healthy” BMI. This year I decided I wanted to get back in shape and started dieting in Jan. It was up and down until May when a flip switched and I really committed to it. First I started restricting my eating which I was used to, then I started running ~6 miles per day 5 times a week, and then I eventually started purging about 1-2 times a week. I was the thinnest I’d been in my life and I met my current boyfriend during this period. Fast forward to now and I’ve relaxed more with food intake but I’ve gained weight over the holidays and haven’t been exercising regularly since October so my muscle has gone. My boyfriend is in great shape and just values a healthy lifestyle overall which makes me feel like he expects me to be skinny and in shape. Especially since I met him when I was thinner, I can’t help but feel like he must not be as attracted to me now and I’m really letting it get into my head and it’s affecting how I act towards him because I’m always feeling down about it now. He has never said anything to make me think like this and tells me I’m beautiful but all his ex girlfriends were very thin and I see him liking girls pictures with perfect bodies so it gets in my head that my body isn’t good enough for him. I’ve been starting to obsess over my weight again this week and have started to restrict eating and start running again. I was wondering if anyone has had this kind of experience and what did you do to regain confidence without going back down that path? I don’t know whether to let him know how I’m feeling but I’m terrified if I bring it up he would say something to confirm what I’ve been thinking in my head and make things even worse.

I am lacking nutrients and refuse to take any type of pills/medication/oral supplement etc. due to my extreme fear of medication.
I have discussed this with my RD before and she suggested that the first step in doing so is to try to consume dairy milk. I haven't had milk since I was a baby (literally) and I've gone by all these years avoiding it and any other types of beverages labeled as ""milk"".
My ARFID has turned me into a vegan and I see all animal products as dirty and unethical. The thought of consuming milk makes me uneasy because I am not a baby cow which is why I shouldn't drink cows milk. I also have this recurring thought and visual image about the fact that the milk is coming from cow udders and that makes me queasy. I can't see myself drinking anything other than water which is what I've been doing for the past five years.

23,Request: Post submission: i shouldn’t have to struggle to pay for my treatment,"I have never had such mixed emotions like this before. Over the course of the past year I developed an eating disorder and it’s gotten to the point where I just don’t see the point of being alive. Over circumstances I couldn’t control I had to say goodbye to my therapist whom I had a very good relationship with and try to start treatment as this is what she recommended. I did not necessarily want to do this as my ed brain basically has full control over what I think/feel at this point, but I’m trying so hard to do it for my family.

My mom just told me how she didn’t know it would be this expensive and started talking about doing less than what the recommended program was and I am just completely freaking out.

It doesn’t help that she doesn’t understand how bad this really is and that she thinks I can just do the bare minimum treatment and be completely back to normal.

24,Request: is this a relapse?,"i want to start this off with a trigger warning, i don’t think its too graphic but im going to mention certain eating habits and weight fluctuations. also, im a bit anxious typing this, so im sorry if any of this is phrased in an odd way. 

ive never been officially diagnosed, so i’ve never gotten appropriate treatment for my ed. my disordered relationship to food and my body started in middle school, but it wasn’t ever bad enough to warrant intervention. declining dessert (my favorite), and not eating at school. 

i maintained a healthy weight and reasonable food intake up until my freshman year, but home circumstances had changed so id had the privacy to restrict my food intake more than before. it wasnt constant, when my parent got pizza id eat it, when i went over to friends houses they cooked vegetarian meals for me and i ate. i snacked, whatever. friends noticed, but it didnt seem that bad. 

it mostly felt like i was exaggerating the issue, but there was a definite effort to restrict, a good amount of guilt when i couldn’t, and eventually my family started to notice that i was looking thin. i wasnt under weight at that point. 

over the next three years my body image got worse, but my food intake wasn’t raising any red flags. id been put on meds and gained a significant amount of weight in what felt like a short period of time. i wasnt healthy, but i wasnt overweight. it was a big change and its still the most ive ever weighed. i hated it and my body and myself, but any attempts to restrict were short lasting. i tried other methods, unhealthy and healthy (i wont state them out of concern for triggering someone) but those didnt last long either. 

when i turned 18, i left home and made some really bad choices. i was abusing substances pretty casually, and i was definitely trying to harm my body. and after about 6 months a friend messaged me to say that they were worried about me, that i looked unhealthy. at that point i weighed myself and realized that i had been eating just enough to stay awake for a few months. i guess i saw this as my “chance”, and i started consciously restricting again. 

i weighed less than i did in highschool. even after i got sober, i clung to my eating habits harder. it became a bit obsessive, and a big source of panic and depression. towards the end, when i was too tired and angry and weak to do much more than smoke and work part time, i started walking two miles to 7/11 in the middle of the night, spending about 8-12$ on junk food, walking back and then eating all of it in one sitting. i called this a binge, and it was where most of my intake came from. it was scary, and i didnt know how to stop. i wont say a number, but i was very underweight for my age and height. 

well, eventually something happened that opened my eyes, and i decided that i wanted to heal, and i realized that it was up to me to do so. i moved, and i really wanted to be better. i didnt have any eating disorder specific treatment, so i did this on my own. it took me a few months to get to a point where my body wasnt scary to look at. i had to cook for myself with literally no experience, and while it was only one of two meals a day, it was enough to give me my energy back and let me gain at a healthy pace. 

i’ve been at a healthy weight for over 6 months now, and i remember how happy i was when i first made it out of underweight territory. i was proud of myself. i am proud of myself. i did this on my own, and ive grown a lot. but around this fall i noticed the feeling again. i cant name it, but it lives in my solar plexus and it feeds me self doubt and hopelessness and it feels like the opposite of a hunger pang. i acknowledged it and forced myself to take care of myself, but..

ive watched myself gradually revert back to old habits. i work most days, and i dont eat before work. i might snack at work, but most days im not motivated to cook after. (and all of that is an excuse. i really just havent been eating more than every two of three days unless someone cooks for me.) i’ll make so many excuses, and i’ll “binge” on snacks late at night before cooking dinner, then feel unwell and not cook for myself. tonight i got off work, id planned to cook for myself, but i ended up walking to the corner store and getting a ridiculous amount of munchies. i sat down in bed and ate until i felt full, and now its 1am and im not making dinner. i got deja-vu when i realized that ive done this before, and im really starting to get scared that im not okay. 

the decrease in appetite came with an increase in depression, and im not convinced that this isnt all the result of chronic stress levels. im learning to love my body and i want to be healthy, but i still have all of these unhealthy expectations for how i should look, and i dont think i understand what a healthy relationship with food looks like. 

i dont think it was ever 100% about food or my weight, i think it was a way to mask a deeper issue. i always sorta assumed it was a symptom of my bpd. a lot of trauma stuff has been coming to the surface since this started back up... im confused, i never got help and i was doing so well, i dont know if this is a relapse..? or how to handle it. i feel out of control and im scared, i dont feel like i can take care of myself.",k758eb,35,0.97,3,2020-12-05 10:27:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/k758eb/request_is_this_a_relapse/,False,False,2020,12

4,Request: Developing hate towards people who eat less than mw,"I'm currently on a diet. Unhealthy, but I'm overweight and want to have normal weight. And nothing else works form me, I can't loose weight slowly because I loose motivation.

Anyway, when I'm on a diet I like to see other people eat unhealthy food, or large portions. Eg, I eat my super small lunch with friends who eat a lot and wait for the comments ""you eat too little"" etc etc.

But, when someone eats less than me, just because they are busy or forget about eating (how TF is this possible) I am furious. I start to lecture them on unhealthy habits, and what it could lead to. When my bf does it I even prepare food for him, just to be sure he ate way more than me.

It happens also when I am in remission and eat normally. Does anyone have similar problems and how do you fight it?",l2ldte,79,0.95,13,2021-01-22 10:56:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/l2ldte/request_developing_hate_towards_people_who_eat/,False,False,2021,1
5,Request: You can recover!,"On Thursday I was discharged from an ED treatment facility. I had been there since the start of September and it was a struggle to get where I am today.

With that being said, I wanted to come on here and let everyone who is either lurking, or following this sub that it is possible to recover. Just keep trying your hardest by putting your best foot forward each and every day.

I know how challenging that can be. Heck, as a 22M it was hard enough for me to accept the fact that I had an ED. Still, I knew that if I worked at it I would get back to a healthy and happier place. I am still not quite where I want to be yet, but I do my best to choose recovery every single day.

Still, one thing my journey taught me is how hard battling an ED is. All of you are warriors for combatting your respective ED’s and I want you to remember: you can do it. Be proud of yourself, love yourself, and choose recovery.

6,Request: I think my friend is suffering from an eating disorder,"(m17) think my friend (f18) suffers from an ED- she practically told me so. She constantly counts calories and tries to skip meals. She walks around her room constantly to try and burn them. She loves baking, but doesn't eat a bite. I am the only person she has confided in.

&#x200B;

I try to be very sensitive and everytime she says she doesn't want to burden me, i tell her we're in this together. I won't let her go through this alone. I've done a lot of research on Eds and what they are and what to say. But some results are contradictory.

&#x200B;

I tried talking gently about the negative health implications and she told me she was aware but didn't care. She wanted it to get worse. She feels insecure in her body, saying she's fat. For the record, she genuinely, objectively isn't but everytime i try and reassure her she brushes me off.

&#x200B;

I don't want to involve school or doctors, if I can avoid it, as i don't want to betray her trust- i already feel guilty about typing this. My intentions, i should add, are strictly for her wellbeing.

7,Request: I fainted and got my wake up call,"(F18) A few days ago I fainted while I was walking my dog. I hit my head on the ground and it still hurts. I skipped breakfast and didn’t drink much. I’m underweight and been struggling with an ED since I was 15 and my family doesn’t know I control my weight because I don’t “look” typically anorexic. I never thought of it as a problem because I never got to the extreme with not eating. I had phase of counting calories but I still keep a careful track of what I eat. Nobody knows I panic when I see the numbers grow on the scale and can’t see the bones on my chest.

&#x200B;

This is the first time I understood it has a direct affect on my health. My mum noticed I should eat more and now she forces me to eat. She knows I have had some mental health issues in the past so each time a new problem emerges she pushes it away by telling me I’m seeking attention. She is naturally underweight and always hated this about herself but also comments on other people when they’re overweight. She judged me when I ate more than her and she judges my appearance a lot which makes me feel terrible about myself. When I confront her about this, she tells me that I shouldn’t be so “fragile”, because it’s only her opinion. When she does sometimes notice I don’t eat normally she gets aggressive.

11,Request: I need suggestions while searching for pro help for my daughter!!,"So, I'll try to make this as brief as I can.  My daughter is 13, and very overweight.  I raised her as a single dad for most of her life, so I take full responsibility for her issues with food, as I have food issues, and am overweight myself.  In fact, the majority of my maternal family has food/weight issues.  They just say ""oh, we're just italian"". But that doesn't make it ok, for me.  

My daughter had been binge eating, I guess, and sneaking food.  Every time I turn around to get something to use for dinner or whatever, it's missing, or half the block of cheese is gone, or there's an empty container of something, with 1 left.  That's a trademark of hers.  Leaving 1 or 2 of whatever it is in the package.  Unfortunately, due to my work hours and her school hours, she is home for a little bit in the mornings and after school.  Maybe 2 hours combined.  I'm sure this is when she does most of it.

I'm well aware professional help is needed, and we've been to a few therapists, who just didn't seem to care, and didn't make any progress, so I'm searching for another now.  However, I know that can take a long time to get under control, so I'm terrified for her, for the time being.  I've considered getting cameras in the house, I've considered putting locks on the fridge and cabinets, but both of these options seem like they could cause more harm than good.  I don't know what to do to control it for now.

12,Request: What can I tell my girlfriend when she’s going through rough days?,"Hey everyone,

&#x200B;

I’ve been with my girlfriend for 8 months now and we love each other very much, but early on into talking she made it clear that he’s has mental issues and has fought with her ED for over a couple years now. She went through a massive weight change since over a year ago and has lost a lot of pounds but i’d rather not mention anything because I don’t want it to be triggering to anyone here.

&#x200B;

She was obsessed with working out, counting calories, and losing weight in an unhealthy way and some days today can be worse than others. Sometimes she just doesn’t want to eat at all, some she worries about the repercussions, some days she seems fine and will enjoy her meals with me when we go out but i’m assuming those thoughts are still in her head. I just don’t want to push her into doing anything she doesn’t and thankfully she’s very comfortable with telling me about it.

&#x200B;

At times, she’ll have bad days. A few days at a time where the voice is constantly in her head. She’s more than a body and she’s beautiful inside and out no matter what as i keep reminding her, and I know she knows that her body isn’t different to what she may be thinking in the moment, or that i would judge her which i’d never. I just want to know if there are any other things I could tell her at times when it’s bad or randomly to make her feel better. I try my best to console her and it works a lot of the time but I just want whats best. Thank you guys for everything.

13,Request: eating on a normal schedule?,"History: father used to binge eat and would eat all of my food when I was a child growing up. I was considered servery underweight according to my doctors. Because of what my dad would do, I would hoard food secretly but never eat it. Later in my teen years when there was enough food in the house for me to eat, I would actually eat the food. When my father was on his weight loss journey he would then comment on my eating habits. At the time (age 15) I was slightly underweight, but I started to restrict my food from that point on. When I was 19 I was at my lowest adult weight. My family complemented me despite me being incredibly ill. 

Today, I fortunately am a healthy weight. I'm proud of it but every day there is a struggle to come to terms with my body since my family comments on my supposed bad eating habits. I still live with them currently for the time being. The only way I've been able to cope and gain weight is by eating out. I have a fear that the food that I bring home and pay for myself, will get eaten. It has happened many times before even though I've requested for them to not touch my food. When my father does eat my food it spins me back into the cycle of buying a lot of food, hoarding it and then not eating it....and today it stated again. I'm not sure what to do, but I have a feeling this is a type of eating disorder. I'm essentially begging at this point for help to understand what I'm supposed to do. I don't like the idea of only being able to eat fast food or eating out in order to maintain some sort of weight.

14,Request: Falling back into restrictive habits while boyfriend can’t eat solid food,"I’m 24f and would consider myself recovered from anorexia, or at least I did. I was treated for the disorder five years ago during my second year of college. Since then I’ve been doing well, eating three times a day, keeping balanced nutrition, getting a healthy level of low impact exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight. 

Recently I put on a few pounds, and have been feeling absolutely awful about it, even though I’m still well within the healthy range. I have been trying to maintain a healthy diet regardless of my disordered thoughts. To do this, I told myself I had to eat when my boyfriend eats. We live together, so encouraging that we eat meals together has really kept me motivated to eat enough to stay healthy. 

The problem is that over time this subconsciously shifted from “I have to eat if my boyfriend is eating”, to “I can’t eat if my boyfriend isn’t eating”, and I didn’t even notice the shift. He recently had his wisdom teeth taken out and can’t eat regular meals. I have been spiraling into my eating disorder since. 

I have a hard time getting myself to eat in front of him if he’s not also eating. But I am aware that I need food to survive and remain in recovery. I went from eating a well balanced three meals per day to the last few days where I’ve only drank coffee. Today I forced down a small salad and a few chips. But I can’t keep up like this. I have tremendous guild whenever I feel hungry, I have noticed that I’m checking my body frequently, and I can’t stop wondering how much I weigh. 

How do I get control of my disorder again? I feel so stupid, because it almost feels like it never left. I can’t really talk to my boyfriend about how I’ve been feeling. I have been in recovery for our entire relationship. He knows I had an eating disorder years ago, and that health is important to me, but we don’t really talk about it. I also have panic disorder and ptsd, so my ed wasn’t really a top concern for a long time.

15,Request: I (19F) Think My Boyfriend (21M) Has an Eating Disorder,"Hi everyone, this is something that has been bothering me for a while now but I can't tell if something is really off or if I'm just overly cautious because I have a history of not having healthy eating habits.

My boyfriend is currently living in a college home with his close friends and the culture of the house is not the healthiest :( I know they're all broke college students but they seriously are living in the worst conditions... the fridge is full of moldy food and the kitchen is all broken and barely works and they don't really cook much other than mac and cheese or the occasional ramen. They drink a couple of times a week and just sort of chill all day because they're graduating college this semester.

My boyfriend especially has been putting on a little bit of weight this year and I still think he is well within the healthy range, but it's clearly making him insecure. For example, yesterday I was at his house all day and all he had was a ramen packet and some shrimp and later in the night, he had a can of Truly with his friends :( That is not enough food to sustain anyone and it's seriously unhealthy. I even ordered extra food in and hoped he would eat some but he didn't :/ I went to bed first and noticed he wasn't next to me and then when he came back he told me he went to work out :( After that, I could hear his stomach grumbling all night and it was seriously breaking my heart. This has also been going on since like the summer.

I spend a lot of time with him so I see him not eat a single meal until like 7pm and then he will eat and complain about how bloated he is and how he wishes he didn't eat so much. I'm really getting worried about him and I don't know how to express it because he's not taking it seriously at all! Yesterday I sort of put my foot down and told him it's seriously upsetting me and I need him to eat but I don't know if this was the best move or if that's how these things are to be handled. When I look online for resources most of them tell me to just sit down and talk to him or speak to a family member but these aren't really applicable to the situation because 1. his family comes from a culture that doesn't believe in such things 2. he is not taking it seriously enough to have a genuine conversation.

I'm just so worried about him... I really don't know how to get through to him that not only is this super damaging to his health but he also won't really be meeting his fitness goals if he doesn't eat enough food or protein!!!



TL;DR : My boyfriend is not eating a sustainable amount of food and nothing I say is getting through to him.

17,Request: How to break a toxic binge cycle in lockdown?,"Hi!

I (25, M) have had incredibly disordered eating for a number of years now. Very long story short, I was a thin child from a fat family, used to be a ballet dancer, quit ballet, put on a lot of weight to the point I was clinically morbidly obese, spiralled into alcoholism (I'm 2 years sober now and in a 12 Step Program), then in 2017 I had a break from university (took ""leave"" in February 2017 to restart that academic year in September 2017, because of the aforementioned addiction issues) and I decided that I wanted to lose weight, I decided to do this with extreme calorie restriction (aided by a particular phone app that counts calories in food) and more than quadrupling my exercise (the same app also uses step count on your phone to work out how many calories you're burning, I passed out at the gym multiple times, had ketone breath, everything, but I didn't think I had an ED because, in my mind at the time, people with ED don't think about food, they think about weight, also, I was objectively, medically still overweight, so I told myself that I couldn't have an ED, I just like to get things done fast and not by half measures). 

Without going too heavy on this and glorifying it or using numbers, the amount of weight I lost in such a short space of time meant that when I went back to my university just to visit for the end of year ball, people genuinely didn't recognise me, I felt great etc etc. The problem is that ever since late 2017 and now, and especially since I got sober at the end of 2018, I have lost and regained the same *amount* in weight about 10 times through a mix of unhealthy secret binging and then extreme restricting, when I stopped losing weight I was actually underweight in BMI. 

Lockdown has been awful, I have been binging full on most days and I'm now back at a weight that I haven't seen since 2017, I'm only a few pounds away from being technically overweight again. I'm in the UK and we're currently in our third national lockdown, and now that I don't have the emotional support blanket of alcohol (a blanket that I do not want back, my life is so much better sober) I just can't stop myself binging until I feel sick, hating myself, then doing extreme home workouts during the day and then binging at night and body checking, my particular issue is with my chest, one of the reasons I wanted to lose weight in the first place is that I had a lot of fat on my chest and now after I binge, I feel like I can feel my chest expanding- which I know logically is ridiculous, but such is disordered binge eating haha. 

I don't know if anyone in here knows how to break the toxic cycle of this? I've been struggling with this immense self hatred, and I really want to break the cycle. I actually logged onto my laptop today to try and trigger myself into restricting massively tomorrow, but I know that if I heavily restrict, I'll just end up binging again and i really don't want to spend another night feeling so full that I feel sick or trying to avoid my reflection in shiny surfaces or not getting undressed before bed because I can't bring myself to look at my body etc etc etc.

I'm so sorry for the long post, I've literally never talked to anyone about this before and it's been going on since 2017, everyone I know sees me as some beacon of weight loss and turning your life around, when really, I'm a fraud in that regard. The closest I've come to any help is that I've watched a couple of YouTube videos (Of Herbs and Altars and Chris Henrie) and I watch their videos like ""ooh damn, I used to do x... I used to do y too... Omg, I thought I was the only one crazy enough to z""

20,Request: Question post: recovering anorexic GF wants to lose some weight,"
First off I’m going to give as much info as possible and I apologize if any of it seems insensitive to others eating disorders or somehow triggering. So my girlfriend (21) of 7ish months is recovering from anorexia, she started doing a bit better a month or two before we started dating but has made great progress since that time. Her anorexia didn’t appear to be as severe as it can be for some individuals but she was certainly malnourished. 

I am a very health conscious person, extremely active (sports/lifting) after our first couple months she was doing much better, she had gained a few pounds. She was feeling better and having less health problems, most of those weird aches and pains and health issues that she seemed to have 5 days out of 7 were almost gone. Shortly after that she decided she wanted to start going to the gym with me, she had always wanted to go but never had the confidence to learn everything you need to know to lift by her self. It’s been a few months and she has gone up another few lbs. She looks great but she wants to trim down a few lbs of fat which she is being nitpicky but I can confirm that there is some fat she can lose that would be within a healthy range. She’s at healthy body fat percentage and I know this because we went to take a body analysis test shortly after starting to workout which I know may not seem like a good idea for many with an ED but I try to be very sensitive to the situation and she has handled it very well (I think numbers can be useful and cool to help see progress and growth with muscle and other factors). 

So what I am worried about is if her body has had enough time to recover, her energy levels are as high as they have been in years and she is healthy and feels good 98% of days. But does her body still need more time to regulate? Could cutting down a few  lbs be harmful to her at this stage? I’ve tried researching what happens after recovering from Anorexia and I can not figure out if this would be ok or if her body would even allow it? I’ve read some things, and it makes sense intuitively to me, that the body in an anorexic situation tries to store as much body fat as it can as a response since it knows it may be a minute before the individual provides it with more fuel. So could it take months to a year for the body to transition to storing and utilizing energy the way healthier bodies do? The only reason I am considering agreeing with the situation and not fighting her a bit on it is because we are planning on getting married in a few months and I get that and want her to feel like she’s at her most beautiful.


TLDR: recovering anorexic GF wants to lose a few lbs to look her best for wedding stuff. Is that healthy? What is the bodies response to recovering from anorexia throughout the first year?",ktgsm5,42,0.96,22,2021-01-09 01:24:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ktgsm5/request_question_post_recovering_anorexic_gf/,False,False,2021,1
21,Request: My friend triggered my relapse. Should I cut her out?,"I had a decade-long ED battle. I met my friend (F26) a little over a year ago and one of the first things she told me was she had an ED, specifically binging. I did my best to help her and even told her about my experiences. 

I’m about two years clean now. Or.. was. 

So she decided she wanted to lose some weight. Fair enough. She started a strict and unhealthy diet to do so and I again tried to help, but realised I couldn’t. 

She kept posting pics of her alarmingly quick weight loss to our group chat and all of our friends praised her for losing weight. None of our friends minus my partner and myself have had EDs and don’t know how they work. However, all of us do have body dysmorphia problems. 

Every topic she brought up was food, numbers, waist sizes, etc and it was super triggering. I asked her personally several times to please not bring it up in front of me because of how triggering it was. She’d get upset, but agree. 
However, she’d always get right back to it like I never said anything. 

It even got to the point our friends were telling me it was beginning to trigger them, but they didn’t know how to approach her about it since she was so “proud”. 

then I relapsed. I left the group chat for a month and didn’t talk to everyone. But my relapse was common knowledge. Once I joined again, the first conversation was of course her weight loss and relating topics of such. 

After the fifth or sixth time in under three months of asking, I finally had enough and left again. She knew something was up because she kept talking to our friends about me and trying to get my attention. 

I got so stressed out, I left social media. I did a stupid thing and checked her Twitter while signed out and saw her publicly talking about “someone being triggered because of her being proud of her success” and absolutely gaslighting my feelings, so I can assume she got the memo now and was just playing dumb. And of course, her other friends were backing her up. It’s taking everything in me not to hop on and publicly call her out on it   

I’m slowly coming out of my relapse, but it’s hard. She’s now dating my best friend so it makes it even harder to avoid her.

22,Request: Feeling like I took a giant step backward,"I feel like I messed up today. I had been doing pretty well for a while, working with a dietician who's into HAES and IE. I made sure that when I moved back in June, that my new apartment wouldn't have a scale in it, because if I have access to a scale, I'll weigh pretty much any time I see it and obsess over the number. I also gained a pretty significant amount because of quarantine, and I just didn't want to think about it any more than I already do just looking at myself in the mirror and feeling my body. I feel like I messed up majorly today. I was briefly visiting family and I had to use the restroom, and there was a digital scale on the floor. It felt like I physically couldn't stop myself from stepping on it. And the number was higher than I thought it would be. The guilt and dread instantly set in, and I knew I'd messed up by weighing myself. I'm considered ""overweight"" now. I was just flooded by all sorts of thoughts about how I should start restricting again, calorie counting, exercising in excess, and about how many calories I should eat to get my weight back down. I started fixating on a number I wanted, even though I know that I'll never actually be satisfied, as much as I think I will be in the moment. I'm glad I haven't seen my mom since June, most of all. I know she'd be disappointed in me, like she already was when I'd gained a little at the beginning of the pandemic. I confided in my partner about the fact that I'd weighed myself and how much it upset me, and it felt like they were disappointed in me. They make most of our meals since we live together, and they make sure I'm fed properly. And I told them about the thoughts I was having, and they told me they wouldn't let me restrict or see calorie counts or anything. I know it's for my own good, but it made me angry nonetheless. I just keep thinking about how to circumvent them, then I feel guilty about it, and then I just keep spiraling. My next appointment with my dietician isn't until next week, but I feel like I need to call her and ask if I can see her sooner. I'm just really disappointed in myself. I'd really, truly appreciate any advice or words of encouragement, since I'm really struggling right now.",kyo51m,34,0.95,7,2021-01-16 18:19:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/kyo51m/request_feeling_like_i_took_a_giant_step_backward/,False,False,2021,1
0,Request: My partner asked me to lose weight and then left me for my friend who is much smaller.,"I am having a huge ED flare up and constant panic attacks over food. Constant intrusive thoughts and feeling I want to disappear. Either advice or support would be helpful.

I have struggled with mostly restricting and binging cycles since I was 9. I was in recovery for the last few years. I have always been either a “healthy” weight or slightly overweight but I guess because of the shape of my body I don’t really look overweight but I am clearly on the curvy/chubby side (am I allowed to say that here? Remove if not!). I say this because basically it’s not easy for people around me to notice when I’m restricting because they see both weight loss and weight gain as socially acceptable for my weight and body type, if that makes sense. I also have body dysmorphia. I’m a woman btw.

Last summer my wife of 7 years who knows about my history basically got into a bit of an argument with me where she asked me to lose weight. I had gained a bit over the years and the pandemic but when I was thinking healthily I didn’t think it was noticeable to anyone except me. I was really shocked that she said that as she’s always been extremely complimentary about my body before. She is very athletic and slightly underweight by BMI and said I could be more like her if I ate more like her and exercised more. I was really upset and went for a walk and when I came back she was crying and apologized a lot and never mentioned it again so I forgave her. However the seed was planted and I started to have more issues with food than I had in a long time and obsessing and trying to lose weight. I actually did lose some but she didn’t mention it or notice anything was up.

Around this time she started hanging out with a friend of ours a lot more. Something about the friendship felt off to me but my wife said I was being jealous and imagining it. They would go out skating and come back to our house and sometimes sort of preen and compliment their own bodies, like pointing out their leg muscles etc. This friend has a very conventionally attractive slim body and I couldn’t stop comparing myself to her and feeling jealous, but I didn’t say anything out loud. The friend also made a couple of comments to me that I really think were meant to be insults about my body but subtle enough that my wife didn’t pick up on them.

Well, fast forward to December. My wife left me very suddenly and then confessed she had feelings for the friend. She cut her off and said she would never see her again. She spent January making me think we were going to reconcile and then I found out she had been with the friend the entire time. Since I found out she stopped speaking to me.

I am really struggling. I can’t stop thinking that I had been thinner she wouldn’t have left me. She didn’t even really seem to like this person that much and would complain about her personality often, I suspect it is largely a physical attraction. I am having literally constant intrusive thoughts about my ex-friends body and my wife admiring it so much more than mine. I keep picturing them laughing about how ugly I am together.

It’s the worst when I’m trying to eat or buy groceries. But then other times I cave and eat something really unhealthy and then have a meltdown over it. I know we’re not supposed to talk about numbers but I have lost a significant amount of weight since she left. Weight loss is all I can focus on. I know it’s not healthy but at the same time I like my body so much more the more weight I lose so it motivates me to keep going. I’m so hungry right now because I had a bad breakfast and lunch and skipped dinner and I am just so tired and I feel horrible. I miss my wife so so badly and I can’t shake off the feeling that I fucked up my whole life by being too big.

I don’t have anyone I can really talk to about this except my therapist so I thought maybe if I posted in here it would help.",lj2mus,108,0.99,6,2021-02-13 15:33:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/lj2mus/request_my_partner_asked_me_to_lose_weight_and/,False,False,2021,2

4,Request: husband and brother are eating all my safe food (community post),"I'm not entirely sure what to do and I know a lot of people with ED have experienced this before. I have a weird mix of ARFID and anorexia that makes eating food a living hell. But slowly over time with the help of my therapist I gathered a list of safe food. Every week I choose a new food to try and add that to my list. 

I don't have a very big list right now. And I feel really bad for being upset but I went grocery shopping two days ago and I opened the fridge, finally ready to eat and my safe food was gone. 

I don't know how to keep the food safe or whatever. I grew up in extreme poverty so having food go missing is sort of a trigger for me. Spending money on food is a trigger for me. It's all very overwhelming. 

I don't want to sound insane but... should I start hiding food? I feel like that's a slippery slope. Or should I just buy more food?

5,Request: stop counting calories (relatively long post thank you for reading),"At the beginning of my diet journey I downloaded myfitnesspal, and like all others I spiralled down into a routine of tracking my calories nonstop into the app to meet the daily requirements. After noticing I was beginning to develop the symptoms of ED, I deleted most diet apps off my phone. But the habit has already been ingrained in me. I can stop looking at nutrition labels wherever I go now. I need my food to have exact measurements (so I constantly use measuring spoons in all my cooking) less or exact is fine but I never go over the serving size stated. I’ve looked up my TDEE and I’ve been trying to eat at my maintenance calories. Even without the app my brain automatically begins to mentally calculate how much I’ve eaten and totalling it up and I stop once I hit the limit for the day. When I eat out and I don’t have the exact calorie count for the food I’m eating I find myself googling the calorie counts of similar dishes on the internet, assuming the worst and taking the highest number and just running with it. At the same time, I’ve been trying to eat back my fear foods (like sugar and fast food) in an attempt to recover but it has ended up backfiring because whenever I’ve a craving for maybe a sweet (like cakes or tarts) I end up skipping a whole meal just to have enough calorie space for that one dessert. I think because of this I end up eating less than I should and I’m losing instead of gaining weight. This mental block and my fear of gaining combined has completely halted my recovery and I don’t know how to get over it because I can’t find the willpower in myself to correct this even though I know they are bad habits
Is there a way to stop this mental caloric calculator in my head that has become instinctual and second nature. Are there resources and self help for fear of gaining weight (my bmi, body fat percentage and weight is completely normal and at the higher end) even when you’re not underweight.

10,Request: Flatmate has started eating a lot less and I don’t know how to help,"My flatmate has recently opened up to me about her eating habits. She said that she aims to eat less than xx calories a day (very low) as it is something she can control amongst many things in her life which she feels she cannot control such as an unhealthy relationship with her family, depression and suicidal thoughts. 

The lack of food she eats combined with her doing a fair bit of exercise everyday means she has lost a lot of weight, which she says she likes as it is a physical indicator that what she is doing is ‘working’. 

This has been really difficult to see happen and I want to help in any way I can. She is currently going through a process of getting diagnosed but this process is slow and I fear that by the time she does get diagnosed then she may be in a critically bad state. 

I know she should be eating more but the idea of trying to force her to eat more food seems like it won’t work and could make things worse?

I've never been diagnosed with an eating disorder, but I've always used food and exercise as a means for control in my life.

I keep saying I'll stop and I specifically avoid buying indulgent foods, but I end up just chewing and spitting the foods I have.

There's not a lot of information on the internet about this as an eating disorder, although I strongly believe it is.

13,Request: Using veganism to restrict!??,"I’m worried that I am using the fact that I am vegan to restrict my food intake.

I have suffered with restrictive eating patterns and bulimia in the past and do not consider myself recovered yet as I occasionally will purge and still suffer with body hatred.

I went vegan January 2020 for veganuary which many people in my life questioned at the time. I have been vegan ever since. When asked about my reasons I give some vague answer on the environment but in reality I don’t think veganism is the answer to environmental issues (trendy vegan food is often imported and contributes to pollution that way). I don’t like animals so people know that it’s not a moral reason. I know my only reason for being vegan is to restrict.

Being vegan means I have a reason to say no to certain foods. I can check nutritional information without being questioned. Eating out means I have to choose the healthier vegan options. 

I want to stop but I’m now grossed out by any animal product. The thought of having an egg makes me sick. I don’t like animals anyway which is the reason I won’t wear leather or fur because it’s like I’m touching something alive. So now I’m worried I’ve given myself more food issues around animal products.

15,Request: Panicking over recovery process,"I want to recover so badly. I want to be healthy for myself and my relationship but i've been so discouraged with my progress. I lost a significant amount of weight back in october/november and couldn't hold food down for weeks after an intense restriction relapse. 

At this point I feel like my body is rejecting nutrients and I panic every day/night because I'm afraid I'm not getting enough calories in. I'm in a lot of physical pain because i'm quite literally starving but can't seem to eat to save my life. It's not like I want to restrict anymore but I've lost my appetite and I've also been too fatigued to cook. I find myself crying and freaking out at the end of the day when I realize I've had nothing to eat and the only food in my house is ""junk"".

I don't eat the junk and at first it was because I was afraid of gaining weight but now I'm afraid of hurting my body with bad food since i'm already malnourished. I'm assuming the overlap of my ED and OCD is what's causing the health anxiety but I genuinely just want to eat healthily. 

Last year I became super self aware of my disorder and now that I'm a little more clear headed I feel like I ruined my body and I can never be ""normal"" again. My digestive system is completely fucked, my face has changed, i'm SO exhausted doing the bare minimum, breathing is hard, etc. Whenever I do eat i'm so bloated and all the weight goes to places I don't want it to go.

A few years back I had what I think was an undiagnosed ed. I lost more weight than I wanted and just never really ate. I have depression, and I think that had something to do with it, but my relationship with food has become much better, to the point I really like eating, though I don’t eat too much,and I really like my food. I have a healthy appetite, and it’s not too big or too small and I’ve been maintaining a healthy weight for years now. However, I’ve been sick to the point I can’t work because of extreme exhaustion and doctors cannot figure out why. My nutritionist thinks it’s all in my diet and about a week ago she put me onto four diets at once, and my depression has massively skyrocketed because of it, and now I’m incredibly anxious about food and thinking about food constantly. It’s an incredibly restrictive diets, with only a very small handful of foods I’m actually allowed to eat, and I’ve noticed a spike in headaches, energy loss, muscle fatigue, etc, and I’m genuinely scared.

0,Request: Wife seemingly has an eating disorder but will not acknowledge or talk about it.,"Years ago my wife (then girlfriend) took an interest in fitness, as did I. We changed our eating habits and started going to the gym regularly. It went well. I lost about 80 pounds and she got in great shape as well. I did not pressure her at all. She started working out first and then I took a good look at my health and decided to commit myself. 

It got to the point where she was going to the gym for 1-2 hours per day and often she would also go to yoga and spinning. That’s not in and of itself a problem but I noticed that she was not maintaining an athlete’s diet, in fact I would classify her eating habits at the time as bizarre, to put it nicely. She ate massive quantities of microwave popcorn. She preferred it burned. If we ordered pizza or something she would put hers in the oven to burn it. The only time I ever saw her eat normal food would be at restaurants and since we had no kids at the time we ate out fairly often. She was really skinny, like to the point where I was not sexually attracted to her. People were asking me if she was OK. Finally I asked her if she was OK. I said “people are saying you have an eating disorder.” She said she’s fine. She kept this up for a long time but eventually the super-odd eating habits (like eating burned food) went away. She continued to exercise 1-3 hours per day, every day. I am aware that “exercise anorexia” is a form of eating disorder but I could not make any headway with her no matter how I approached the subject. 

Fast forward to when we are married and trying to have a baby. One day I am looking for the source of a plumbing leak so I have to move a lot of things in her bathroom cabinet. I found tampons in there. Like hundreds of them. The oldest were so old they had expired. I talked to her again and she said she has not had a period in “years.” Also, during all this time she refused to go to any doctor other than to get a Pap smear and mammogram. Finally, though, I was able to get her to go to the doctor. They did tests and found hormone issues. She started going to acupuncture. There was this one really strange day where I was sick with norovirus (it makes you vomit) and I told her that my whole system just feels bad for days after a norovirus bout. She asks why. I explain how vomiting effects multiple physiological systems. It throws your whole body out of whack. She got really quiet for a second and asked me why I would say that. I just said I was explaining how I felt and why. I left it at that.

I swear, from that day on she started to gain a little weight (yay) and her periods came back about a month later. She gained enough weight that she had to get rid of all her extra small clothes. Not long after she got pregnant and as far as I could tell maintained perfect nutrition and healthy eating habits. She looked healthy and our daughter was born healthy and perfect. 

Things seemed normal while our daughter was breast feeding. We let her self-wean so she occasionally took breast milk all the way until she was 22 months. March 2020. The pandemic started, my wife’s job became 100% WFH. My job is 100% not WFH. It’s like a switch was flipped and everything started all over. We had gotten a Peloton which she would use maybe 1-2 hours a week. That turned into 1-2 hours per day. Her eating habits aren’t as bizarre but I never see her eat anything between the hours of 6am and 8pm. She does not eat breakfast, lunch, or dinner with myself and our daughter. The only foods I see her eat are kale salads with no dressing, black beans, cereal, and cheese-its. That’s not the only food she eats, however. If there are ANY kind of sweets in the house she eats them in secret. One time she went through an entire bottle of maple syrup in 1 week (she was putting it on black beans or cereal.) If I make a frozen pizza she eats whatever is left of it as soon as I go upstairs to give our daughter a bath.

OK, I concede she needs a lot of calories due to the amount and intensity of her workouts. The thing is she looks very unhealthy again to the point where one of her friends asked me if she was OK. 

So I decide I need to have the talk. Turns out an opportunity soon arose. I go upstairs to go to bed a short time after she has gone up. Right away in the bathroom I know something is wrong. It smells like vomit. I look in her sink and it has vomit in it. I go to her and ask if she’s OK. She says yes, of course, why even ask? I say “because there’s vomit in the sink. You threw up.” 

She said it was “colored spit” from brushing her teeth, not vomit. I tell her I don’t believe that. I brush my teeth the same way and my sink does not look like that. She says “I don’t know what to tell you.” 

Another time I came home from work, went to use the bathroom, opened the toilet and it was full of what looked like vomit. If her bowel movements look like what I saw then she needs to see a doctor. Same conversation...same result. Denial. Won’t see a doctor. Won’t go for a checkup (she’s 38.) 

Last night I came downstairs from putting our daughter to bed at 9:30 and my wife ate cereal, popcorn, crackers, and black beans continually until 10:15. Seriously, she ate without pause and it was making me uncomfortable after awhile. Just bowl after bowl of food. Furthermore, if I ate like that she would check me over it.

I don’t know what needs to happen here. I need to add that my wife does not respond to authoritative rhetoric. She grew up with a “my way or the highway” type of stubborn asshole for a father and if I take that kind of line with her she shuts down. 

She’s highly educated and intelligent. If she has an eating disorder she fully knows it and is choosing to continue. My opinion is strongly that she has an eating disorder but I don’t have any proof other than what I’ve observed now and in the past. I am trying to give her a wide berth and be supportive because she is under a lot of duress from the social isolation and from work stress. 

I am just totally lost and mentally exhausted. I do most of the housework and chores. I do all the cooking. I do all the dishes. I do 80% of the childcare including all bedtimes, baths, and naps. I work a full time director-level job. I want to help her but I just feel like I do not have the mental energy to be the one who puts the puzzle pieces together to reach any kind of solution with her. Sometimes I feel like she left the vomit out for me to find as a cry for help but when I went right to her about it she just denied, denied. 

Any help or support would be appreciated. I am aware this is a mental illness and not a choice and I want to help her get treatment.",m7no0n,127,0.98,10,2021-03-18 10:10:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/m7no0n/request_wife_seemingly_has_an_eating_disorder_but/,False,False,2021,3
1,"Request: HA recovery, gaining weight, losing pretty privilege","I've lost my period for some months because of calorie restriction for only a year. I've been trying to get into recovery for a few weeks now and I'm seeing changes in my body. My stomach and face is bloated all the time and I tend to binge eat and feel and uncomfortable all day. My weight is definitely increasing and I guess that's the goal but a part of me is still so scared of gaining weight. I feel like I'm not even sick enough to go through this even though I lost my period as I look normal, I'm not underweight and I've not restricted as long as other people going through recovery. 

This is going to sound so vain but I'm also especially terrified of overshooting my original weight because I actually really LIKE how I look after losing weight and people tell me I look good and I know I'm gonna look worse if I put on more weight. It really affects my self esteem. What if I become so fat that people start treating me differently? Pretty privilege from being thin (in my country, thin is preferred way more than curvy/chubby) is REAL and I have experienced it. It's mostly subconscious but humans just tend to treat pretty people better. They get the benefit of doubt, they get served better in healthcare or even just retail/F&B, they get more opportunities for social and career advancements and people just want to be around them more. I'm not discounting personality and hard work but being pretty sure helps in life. And comparing myself and how others treat me before and after weight loss, I guess I only look pretty when I'm thin. I don't know how to let go of my current appearance and am dreading how much worse I'm going to look if I continue with recovery. Sure I might get my period back sure I might not feel cold anymore but there are downsides too due to this pretty privilege thing and my country just views thin as pretty. 

I'm filled with anxiety and I don't want to socialize and this is even affecting my grades. Why does going through recovery feel worse than when I was restricting? I could deal with fatigue and hunger but this fear of judgement is truly crushing me. Please help give some advice or reassurance...I don't know how to be positive about this when all I do is worry about how others may subconsciously treat me differently if I get to a point of looking worse just to get my period back. I'm afraid to go all in in my recovery and give in to hunger cues even though I know I have to. I wish I was in a country where there's a more diverse opinion on what's beautiful but not here.",m3eyzf,60,1.0,7,2021-03-12 10:37:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/m3eyzf/request_ha_recovery_gaining_weight_losing_pretty/,False,False,2021,3
2,Request: Afraid and discouraged to workout due to people constantly telling me I have an ED," 

I did struggle an ED when I was a kid but that was only because I hated my body and had no nutrition knowledge at all so I did what was logical to me at the time which was restriction and over exercising . I no longer think like that and understand I need food to function. Im able to eat like ""normal"" even things that I would've considered bad foods before without feeling guilty.

I do however still struggle with my body in the fitness sense, Im trying to improve my performance and strength. But everybody is always so negative to me and treats me like Im still deep into an ED and Im hardcore restricting when it simply isnt true. It makes me really doubt myself and overeat till the point where I feel sick because Im scared I might still be restricting without realizing.

The effects it has on my exercise habits are the worst tho. I really love dancing and I used to do it all the time as my main source of cardio but also because it was fun and I could just spend the whole day doing it. But now whenever Im bored and I get the urge to dance I stop myself from doing it because I dont want to slip back into my ED. I've been told that exercising all day is just unhealthy no matter how much I might enjoy it.

How the hell do I break free of this mindset? It makes me so depressed to not workout or to just do the bare minimum.",mb18xk,57,1.0,7,2021-03-22 23:43:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/mb18xk/request_afraid_and_discouraged_to_workout_due_to/,False,False,2021,3

4,Request: Triggered by a Treatment Provider,"Has anyone ever been triggered by  a treatment provider?  I see a nutritionist who specializes in eating disorders. She and I have butted heads before because her inability to acknowledge that when I am significantly overweight (from binge eating) I am not able to physically do the activities that make me feel happiest and most powerful.  This has led to me, in the past, hiding things from her.  I use a lot of her strategies, but sometimes I also listen to myself and my own needs.
This worked very well, and I was very regulated, until a number of life stressors came up and general wear down of the pandemic. An area that we have been working on (while I was regulated) was drinking more water, since I only ever drank Coke Zero.  In order to help this goal, I bought this super tech-y water bottle that weighs what you drink so you know when you achieve a water goal. This made me feel super good about myself, and I was drinking water for the first time in my life (at 28). It was a measurable accomplishment each day, and my physical problems due to not drinking water (head aches, exhaustion, cravings) were mitigated.
In my session with my nutritionist, I was so excited to tell her about the whole water bottle development, and her response was super disappointing. She said, ""Well I don't want you to fixate too much on the number."" I totally get why this strategy is good for eating disorder when we're talking about calories and weight, but really? Water? Imo, striving to drink water when I literally drank zero water before was a big win in terms of my overall health.
Anyway, this was the straw that broke the camels back. After that session, the water bottle use immediately tapered off and I am going days without drinking water again.  Binges and even purging started again, and my weight started to climb. I know this isn't her fault, but I am so frustrated by her attitude and how she could have thought that was the right thing to focus on.
Has anything similar happened to anyone else? I am going to work to get myself more regulated (therapy tomorrow!), but I just don't know how I can continue with that nutritionist.",mcmpy4,50,0.96,13,2021-03-25 01:42:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/mcmpy4/request_triggered_by_a_treatment_provider/,False,False,2021,3
5,Request: Eating to cope with stress,"I've been struggling with food habits since I was a teenager. When stressed, I tend to eat whatever I crave in the moment, and it's almost always fast food.

A huge amount of my income is spent on just these meals.

I've only recognised this pattern in the past two years after seeking therapy for depression and anxiety. I try to let the craving for a certain food pass by but after a few hours, despite being full on a different meal, I end up eating whatever it was I was craving. It is as if I cannot let the thought of it go away until I have it. Lately I don't even feel the satisfaction I think I will after having the meal.

6,Request: Academic PhD request,"I’m Talia,  am a second year trainee clinical psychologist, with a passion and special interest in eating disorders and the idea of preventative strategies so that people don't end up being turned away from services, or alternatively on an 18 month treatment waiting list. Having had my own experiences of an eating disorder, alongside supporting friends and a family member I've found that approaches to treating eating disorders can be quite narrowly focused, often CBT for eating disorders is used in NHS settings and often treats presenting symptoms rather than underlying causes.
 
I've designed a two-week compassion focused intervention for young people aged 16-21 with eating difficulties which is online and using virtual reality technology. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that a compassionate approach may be valuable for people with eating disorders, due to high trait perfectionism, self-criticism and experiences of shame.
 
I was hoping you may be able to share my research (if that's appropriate) on the sub reddit. I feel like it’s something people would want to possibly take part in, as I know the eating disorder community is very proactive and focused on increased support, recognition and funding.  
 
It's received ethical approval from the university and has been designed by myself and other researchers without commercial incentive. I honestly just want to make a difference to people with eating disorders.

Hi. Let me start this off  by saying i’m a 16 year old girl who’s trying to lose weight for the  summer. I already don’t have the best relationship with food because i’m  autistic and there’s a lot of foods that bother me. For the past year  or so i’ve been a little overweight and insecure about my looks so i  finally decided to take action and try to lose weight. i’ve been dieting  for about a month and it was going well at first. But now I feel like  i’m becoming too obsessive with it. Like I even started worrying about  the calories in the vitamins i take. My mom also makes comments about my  weight whenever she gets the chance and constantly reminds me that I  need to expand my palette and start liking more foods, or i’m gonna get  diabetes. So that isn’t really helping me either. My biggest concern is  that for the past 2-3 days, i’ve lost a lot motivation to eat and  haven’t really had much in the past few days. And today I just can’t  bring myself to eat at all and i don’t like that. So my question is, am I  developing an eating disorder or am I just in some sort of diet  depression?

9,Request: meeting up with my husband's friend and his wife that we haven't seen in years," 

I  am thinking of meeting up with my husband's friend and his wife that we  haven't seen in years. We had issues in the past with jealousy that she  had towards me and it was during a stressful time in my life with my  ED. I had an extreme ED that kept me very thin but also very ill. No one  knew about the ED, they just saw a very thin woman. We moved away and I  gained a lot of weight back once I sought help for the ED. The weight  gain changed my appearance dramatically and my self-esteem got much  lower. I have since lost some of the weight that I gained but still am  much heavier than when I last saw my husband's friend and his wife. I am  worried to see them again after all these years because I have since  gained a lot of weight and no longer feel like the 'catch' that I once  felt. I feel better now that my ED is under control, but I still feel  apprehensive about seeing them again because I don't want to be made fun  of. This anxiety of seeing them again doesn't necessarily make me want  to relapse with the progress I made with the ED, but it definitely makes  me consider it sometimes. How would you handle meeting with people from  your past that only knew you as thin because of your ED? Would you be  embarrassed to meet with people due to extreme weight gain? Is it common  for people to feel this way after gaining weight from an ED?

14,Request: Incorporating movement again?," 

Hi everyone,

I  am truly struggling in my recovery when it comes to movement and  exercising. My ED was heavily rooted in my exercise habits and I have  not stepped foot into a gym in two years now.

This  was a recommendation from my dietitian (to stay away from the gym) and I  thought it was a good one but now I have no idea how to bring movement  back into my life in a sustainable way. I know there’s yoga and I do  that, but there’s a lingering voice that tells me it’s not enough  physical movement that I’m getting and I need to do more. Every time I  do home exercises my ED brain clicks back on immediately and it’s hard  to silence, so I stay away from it.

My  question is, is there a professional I can go to who can help with this  specifically? I feel like that’s where there is a gap with my treatment  (and maybe treatment in general?). It seems there is no concrete  support for people that have had this experience with exercise and  instead I have been recommended podcasts and Instagram pages 🤷🏻‍♀️  it’s not enough and I need something more concrete.

18,Request: Confused about something my doctor said," 

Yesterday I spoke to a doctor through telehealth video. It’s like a step you can take to determine if you need to see a doctor in person. I contacted him because everyday for the past 3 weeks I have felt nauseous throughout the day. (I’m 1000% positive I’m not pregnant). He asked for a bit of background so o told him so basic stuff like sometimes I get headaches, I only eat once a day because eating outside of dinner literally makes me want to vomit. Like, if I try to physically put food in my mouth before dinner time I get nauseous and can’t finish it. No clue why, I just developed it. I told him other things like I was diagnosed with PTSD, Anxiety and Depression. I told him I smoke a lot too. So as he’s giving me some suggestions on what it could be he mentioned “well this could also be happening from your eating disorder.” And I was so confused because I’ve never had anyone say that to me. I never thought eating once a day was an eating disorder. Now I’m completely spiraling, Do I actually have an eating disorder or is this doctor just an ass?",m04hbp,36,1.0,17,2021-03-08 01:19:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/m04hbp/request_confused_about_something_my_doctor_said/,False,False,2021,3

1,"Request: I have atypical anorexia, but wish I was sicker. Now I understand the cruel competitiveness of EDs.","After years of restrictive eating, into laxative abuse, diet fads, pills, fasting, purging while restricting, and bingeing without purging (never felt full, always just felt empty — it was depression emptiness and I didn’t know then), I got diagnosed with atypical anorexia yesterday. 

For a moment, it made sense. I finally had a name to the awfulness that I consistently felt about my body and weight, after long last, over 15 years later. I had eating and body image issues for the longest time, except I felt it was normal seeing as I was a fat person. My stomach constantly grew in size (in my perspective). As a 23 year old, I haven’t been in a healthy weight range nor underweight (per BMI) for maybe 15 of those years. I still am not, today. 

It was last year, in the midst of deep depression and watching way too much youtube in bed, that i started to realise how my meals in a day were much less than normal. I would see What I Eat In A Day videos and realise that a person’s one single meal out of three would still amount to more than everything that I’d let myself eat in an entire day. And even then, I still felt the need to starve myself even more. 

But very quickly after the words ‘atypical anorexia’ came out, did the competitiveness start. I started thinking — what a failure, i couldn’t even lose enough weight to have ‘actual’ anorexia. My ECG results showed sinus tachycardia and borderline right axis deviation, which was otherwise considered normal, and I was frustrated that I hadn’t ruined myself enough to have low blood pressure, bradycardia, risk of heart failure (i struggle with suicide too, and it seemed inviting) — was I not starving myself enough? Even when I knew that my higher blood pressure and tachycardia is possibly the result of being on the riskiest dose of Effexor XR (at 350mg, where it increases blood pressure), I felt so disappointed that I couldn’t even get sick enough. 

I’d lost 21% of my body weight within a year, but yet have still been well above the healthy BMI range. 21% is significant, I guess, but I’m also still in an 82% surplus of my ideal weight (less than half of my highest weight), and still want to lose more. 

I feel like such a disturbed person for feeling like I need to be doing worse, despite anorexia being one of the illnesses with the highest morbidity and mortality rate. The competitiveness is ridiculous. And even after saying all this, and being told by my ED psychiatrist that I should remind myself to eat more, I can’t help but feel even more determined to eat even less, because I’m so mad that I’m not doing worse than I already am. 

But I have a dietician and a physiotherapist to see now. I don’t know how it’s supposed to work. What if the dietician wants me to eat more meals, and that makes me gain weight again? What would a physiotherapist do in this case? I have such trouble exercising after building a really bad relationship with it years back, only made worse by depression and absolute lethargy (walking for a few minutes already makes my back and legs and core feel painfully sore). I don’t know what to expect from seeing a dietician and physiotherapist in this case. 

I’m just so confused, and discouraged, and the competitive ED voice is just so annoyingly loud right now.",n0yon5,104,0.98,11,2021-04-29 06:50:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/n0yon5/request_i_have_atypical_anorexia_but_wish_i_was/,False,False,2021,4
2,Request: I’m not thin enough to feel loved,"My mom is extremely critical of my weight.

One day I asked her if she would love me more if I was thinner and she replied “I only want my children to be healthy” and avoided the real answer. When I was 18 I became chronically ill due to my restrictive eating (in and out of hospitals) and I lost a lot of weight. My moms response was to tell me how jealous she was of me and that she “loved that I lost weight, it just sucks it had to be this way”. I’m now 23 and obviously, no longer chronically ill, and have gained some weight back. But now I’m back to believing that because I’m not bone skinny, I can’t be accepted...

4,Request: Anyone else deal with orthorexia?,"My therapist made me aware of this eating disorder since I show a lot of the traits. It’s basically an obsession with healthy eating and the idea that a food must be “pure” and healthy in order for me to be able to eat it. I get so scared about going out to eat because none of the options are going to be healthy. It makes me want to avoid social events. If I eat any kind of junk food i spiral, thinking that I’m going to have a heart attack and die because I’m so unhealthy, etc. (I am very young, heart disease doesn’t run in my family, and I am normal weight if not a little under). And then the next day I feel the need to restrict and only eat the cleanest foods possible. 
I know logically that a heart attack won’t happen, but because this ED often goes hand in hand with OCD I can’t get my brain to believe differently.

5,Request: I want to stop caring and love food again,"Hi all! 

I’m writing this because I honestly don’t know what to do. I’ve been struggling to eat.. honestly anything for the last month/last 2 months. I don’t really know what triggered me so badly, but I feel guilty whenever I eat. I don’t see food as ‘oh yummy, food!’ anymore but as carbs, calories and sugar that will make me fat and I hate that I think about food this way. 

I am very good at hiding it, whenever I’m with other people I just eat, doesn’t matter how much or if it’s healthy or unhealthy, but all I can think about when I eat (especially something with a lot of sugars/calories/carbs) is how this will affect my weight and my body. Let’s just say that if I would be alone 24/7, I would probably only eat breakfast for the entire day and that’s it (which is so dangerous). 

I also just feel guilty when thinking about things I love (or loved) to eat, like chocolate and I can’t imagine people eating something just because they like it. For example, my friend was eating a chocolate bar while we were in a Zoom meeting, and all I could think about is how she could eat something like that without feeling guilty. That’s when I realized there’s something very wrong and dangerous about my mindset, not with her just enjoying her food. 

I downloaded this one app a few days ago that gives you advice on how many calories you should have, and I’ve been tracking it like CRAZY, almost obsessive, so I think that triggered me even more. I absolutely hate myself when I eat more than the recommended amount of calories and wanna punish myself the day after.

So, I know this is very complicated, maybe too complicated for a simple Reddit post, but can someone please give me some advice on how I can stop caring so so so much about carbs, sugars and calories so I can eat whatever I want. I’m afraid I’m losing control and that I’ll ACTUALLY only eat breakfast, instead of only thinking about it.",n09pfz,57,0.99,11,2021-04-28 07:49:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/n09pfz/request_i_want_to_stop_caring_and_love_food_again/,False,False,2021,4

Overall, I can generally control the behaviours but not the thoughts, and I've made my peace with that. I don't think I'll ever be ""normal"" towards my body or food.

What I can't make my peace with, is that I seem to have a mini-relapse EVERY time I go through big changes in my life. I've recently moved across the country for a PhD, and sure enough, I initially lost a load of weight. Sure enough, I was (suspiciously) happy about that. Then, sure enough, I started binging. I've taken laxatives again for the first time in 1-2 years, and I've purged again for the first time in months. I've regained the weight, I feel disgusting, and I'm at the point where I'm binging on anything (butter, as one embarrassingly low example) so now I can't even trust myself to have basic household items around. 

I usually snap out of it by going to the gym more - I can't lift weights if I'm eating badly, and it motivates me to get back on track. I can't do that right now due to the pandemic.

I either completely stop eating and survive on a couple of coffees a day, or I eat big portions all throughout the day (even when i'm not hungry). Last year, when covid first started and my country went through its first lockdown, I was going through one of the worst periods of my life. I was suicidal and could barely do anything. Naturally, I wasn't eating at all. I live in a muslim country though, and it coincided with ramadan (fasting month), so my family wasn't really worried. I was also working on my capstone and could only work with a nocturnal sleeping schedule, so they just assumed I was eating when they were asleep. I was also obsessively working out. I lost xx kgs during that period and i've never gotten so many compliments. Neighbors i've never spoken to and distant acquaintances were telling me how better I looked after losing the weight. I happily took the compliments and ignored the fact that not eating fucked up my body and my physical and mental health. Fast forward a couple of months, I'm done with my capstone, I'm doing a master's and I'm heavily stressed. I stopped working out. I kept the weight for a bit, and I stupidly thought ""maybe my metabolism is working great now"". But the more stressed I got, the more I ate, and the more weight I gained. I started to hide food in my closet and binge eat it in hiding and then cry afterwards (this is one of those instances rn). It is now a year later after i lost the weight and I gained more than half of it back. I've never hated my body more. And I have no one to talk to about it. Every single one of my friends (even my boyfriend) is skinny. I have a best friend with whom I had shared my struggles last year, but I can't bring myself to talk to her about this right now. I know she would never judge me but I'm so terrified of her thinking that i'm a disgusting pig that i would just rather her think that i'm still starving myself. Ramadan is in 2 weeks and all i can think about is ""maybe I can get back on track !! maybe i'll be able to lose that weight again!!"" (disclaimer : pls no one make any comments about how this month is not about weight loss. i know. leave me be.). I made an appointment with a psycho-nutritionist to help me lose weight in a ""healthy way"" (???), but it's not until mid-may, i don't know what to do til then.

16,Request: Craving calories,"Hi everyone, usually I try to power through things like these alone, but I'm a bit at wits end. Over the course of the last year I've dieted down and build muscle to the point where I was easily in the best shape of my life. Bodyfat percentage was low and I had a really good physique in general. I was really happy with my diet and it was not restriction as much as just a general lifestyle change. Now since january I've lost myself a bit in this whole thing. After two or three days of decent overeating I went on another cut and dieted down to about xx - normal bmi range - (I'm 185cm). Since then I've started having the urge to cheat on my diet with highly palatable calorically dense food. At first the urges were weeks apart, but while I was on a break from Uni I've changed my daily routine. Before I wrote the bike to and from work (about 25min each) monday through friday and worked out every other day. During the break, I added bike rides on saturday and sunday and walked at least 10000 steps a day, which often blew up to about 25000. In hindsight I realize a problem with that behaviour, but back then I did not really see it. So the urges become stronger and appeared more often. When I had them, I literally could not stop eating at all. No matter how hard I tried I could not stop and consumed 6-8 thousand calories easily in a day. When I realized the context of the problem I dialed the fitness back to a normal amount again, but the hunger would not go. When I got it, it was bad, but would usually be gone after a day. The reason I'm writing this is that its wednesday today and it has not stopped since sunday. I've drastically overeaten four days in a row and I don't know if it'll stop. I'm so tired of food, but I can't stop eating. Does anyone have advice on what I should do? I think this might be hyperphagia as a result of going too low in bodyfat. I usually love my diet and I eat lower calorie high volume food, which satisfies me.

Right now I am only craving high calorie food items. No matter how much I eat, I don't feel satisfied, even if I feel sick from it. No matter what I've tried the feeling won't go away. I'm exhausted mentally and physically. Would it be a good idea to see a doctor about this? Maybe get my hormones checked.

Diverting my thoughts onto something else is very difficult for me because my depression just makes me unmotivated and fatigued most of the time (I'm  not excusing it either, and most of the time I do try to push it through, it's  just to let you know how I generally feel).

I just want to know if any of you have any tips and tricks that can help with the anxiousness that cravings produce. Yesterday I binged on cookies that made me go WAY past my calorie deficit  and I almost had an anxiety attack over it. I legit don't  know how to handle these cravings other than to bite my lip and hope someone eats it quickly lmao.",mx7xpo,38,1.0,21,2021-04-23 23:33:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/mx7xpo/request_how_to_handle_cravings_while_depressed/,False,False,2021,4
19,Request: Questions about how i’ve ate past 3-4 years,"so for going on about 3-4 years now i’ve barely eaten anything at all. to elaborate if i woke up around 8 am and so happened to get hungry enough to eat i’d eat around 5-6 pm. NORMALLY id take a few bites and literally be so sick i didn’t wanna eat anymore so i’d stop. if i SOMEHOW managed to finish all of what i was eating, then i’d be fine till the next day and the same process. so say i stay up all night cause my sleep schedules are fucked off and i wake up at 5 pm, i probably wouldn’t eat anything at all that day. if i did, it’d be at like 3-4 am and by that time if it made me sick and my stomach started hurting, i’d then go to sleep. and so on. i imagine you get the picture. not only have i not been eating, my sleep schedule has been fucked off as well. BEFORE all this i was like 18 and xxx lbs (normal bmi) 5’11 (male)
NOW i’m just 22 a constant xx-yy lbs same height (underweight bmi). i don’t have health care or anything like that but i’m honestly wondering if there’s anything i should be seriously concerned about.

2,Request: My younger sister is in the midst of a particularly low point with her anorexia," 

My younger sister is in the midst of a particularly low point with her anorexia. It's rather intense. I have never had an ED, or been close... on the contrary, food is my best friend, always has been... my family and I are doing everything we can to wrap our heads around it (any advice here would be great as well). She has been opening up to me about her thoughts during my visit home to see her, expressing to me that her ""ED thoughts"" are particularly strong right now - specifically that food will harm her, make her fat, make her stomach hurt, and that getting through this is so much arduous work and she is not convinced that she even deserves that kind of attention and care from herself. It is body image, self-worth, and seemingly most prominently, the stomach pain (tips on navigating this are beyond welcome too). She has been in and out of treatment centers, but she has moved around from place to place, even signing herself out at the last one, never completing a program for a multitude of reasons: the food tastes bad (food always tastes bad to her, but extra bad in the facilities) and you don't get to pick what you eat, her therapists are not present enough to actually talk about things and do actual work (they just force her to eat and sleep, that's it), she doesn't get to go outside, etc. Honestly, sounds awful to me too. I mean, isn't a large part of ED the issue of mentally linking food, or lack thereof, with punishment? Does this approach of taking away privileges and human rights to breathing fresh air not simply reinforce this way of perceiving food? Genuinely, I want to understand if this works for people - if she is simply resisting inpatient because her ED is in the drivers seat, or if these concerns are valid and shared by many who have gone to inpatient, or perhaps a bit of both.

Now she is in this tough spot. She is at my parents place where my parents are the ones figuratively wrestling with her to complete her meals, which seem to be one of three things: a shake of ensure mixed with peanut butter and ice cream, 5 or 6 yogurt covered pretzels, or a slice of bread. She freezes and I can see her panic on her face when she is served food. As you may have deduced, she is slowly losing weight after the weight she sustained from 6 or so months on a feeding tube. She is at the point where if she went to an outpatient/partial program, they would likely strongly suggest inpatient or drop her from the program for liability reasons. Same with therapists... she is meeting with one tomorrow who may be more open to the possibility of taking her on than others. She needs real, intensive help, more than what our (incredibly giving and self sacrificing) parents are capable of but she is just so incredibly resistant and non-responsive to the kind of care they offer at inpatient! Where do we go from here? Is it unsafe for her to be here at home? ...will she be ok? And what can I do, as her sister? It's incredibly hard to watch someone you care about so much become so pinned by their own mind... listless and numb and rigid with fear of life. She is really in the thick of it, folks.

She seemed upset  that I caught her body checking, but then she just brushed it off as nothing with “I just think the lead singer is pretty.” I feel stuck because every time I’ve suggested taking down some of the posters, I’m met with intense opposition.

8,Request: Fat Acceptance vs. Ruining My Health,"Hi.
I (53F) have struggled with various eating disorders from the time I was about eight years old. It's mostly been BED, with periods of severe restriction especially in my 20s and 30s. I finally sought help at the end of 2019 and spent four months in an intensive outpatient program at a highly-regarded eating disorders clinic. It helped tremendously, especially with ""fat acceptance"". Some of the best lessons I learned were that food is just fuel, there are no ""bad"" foods, and ""fat"" is just an adjective. When I left the program, I had tools under my belt and a new outlook.
And then the pandemic hit. Along with the isolation and the toxic positivity that is thrown at essential workers (I am one) and some severe mental health struggles my kid was having that were leading to rages and abuse, the binges came back -- not quite full-bore, but close.
I have been excusing my binges by comparing them to worse binges I've had in the past. I keep hanging on to ""fat acceptance"" and the fact that I am the fat girl who baffles doctors with her perfect blood pressure and perfect cholesterol and perfect A1C. Thing is, it's gotten to the point where my weight is affecting my health now. I am at the highest weight I have ever been in my life. My feet and lower back hurt all. the. time. My stomach is starting to get in the way of sex. I took my dog out for a walk yesterday and it took 20 minutes to walk less than half a mile. Five years ago, I was walking 20-30 miles a week.
I spent so many years hating my body. Treatment got me to love my body again. Now I am having a hard time reconciling the fact that I need to take action to be kind to my body against the old tapes that are telling me that any sort of modification, tracking, or restriction of food intake means that I hate my body.

10,Request: Could my partner be suffering from bulimia?,"I'll give a little bit of background first.

My partner has a chronic migraine condition which means she is constantly in pain and it can flare up for days or weeks where she'll be in high amounts of pain. She has been vomiting daily as a result of this pain and I don't doubt that it's making her vomit. However, recently I have started to suspect that the vomiting might not entirely be a result of the pain, she had a new procedure done about a month ago which has helped reduce this pain and the vomiting still hasn't stopped.

She had a doctors appointment a while back and found that she'd gained a bit of weight, mainly due to being inside 24/7 (because of Covid rest) and not really excercizing much. She's been concerned about her weight and joked a few times that at least the vomiting from the pain will help her lose weight, I didn't think much of them at the time but now it's starting to feel like that might be the reason why she's still vomiting so much. She's claimed that her body has just gotten into a habit of vomiting and it just needs time to stop, but it's showed no signs of slowing down at all.

I've been planning on talking to her about it and seeing if it might be bulimia as I'm aware it can be subconscious but I wanted to see if it looks like bulimia to anyone else?

We are both 14 and she's been trying not to eat since she was 11. some random guy called her fat and she says that this started all. since 2021 started her mom has been making comments on her when she eats like ""you are eating too much"", ""you are gaining weight"", etc. when she's around with other people she has to eat so she does it but when shes alone sometimes tries to avoid it. she drinks water and smoke to calm hunger and a few times tried to vomit but she couldn't. she told her mom that her comments were hurting her and that she has been struggling to eat but her mom just got mad. she also self harms and wanted to kill herself a few times but luckily she never tried it. her parents don't believe in therapy. after a lot of months of pushing they finally sent her with a therapist but after a month they stopped because ""it won't fix anything"" and ""it's a waste of money and time"". we've been together for a few months and I've been trying to be the most supportive I can for her. yesterday she told me about her eating problems. I knew that something was going on and tried to talk to her but she wasn't ready. I didn't knew it is that bad. her parents won't help her and I do everything that I can but its not enough. another thing that worries me is that she has a friend who is also struggling with this and they talk about it. the problem is that she's not supportive at all. she tells my gf ""tips not to eat"" whenever she asks. due to online classes it's impossible rn to see a school counselor so we agreed that she will try to write and email and send it to her school tutor and if she can't we will do it together the next time we see each other. we talked a lot about this yesterday. she told me she doesn't believe she's fat but I think she's scared of gaining weight.

12,Request: I miss the care I got before I began recovery. How do I get over that nostalgia?,"This is a hard post for me, especially because I know people wrongly portray people with Eating Disorders as “just begging for attention.” That said, I really feel like I miss the care people showed me before I started weight restoration. 

I used to go to a nice doctor’s office every week because she was worried about me. Now she’s telling me that she’ll see me in a month, and if I’m still weight-restored, we can do once every three months. 

Also, how did it become the case that I have the biggest appetite of all my friends? My friends used to have to trick me into going to restaurants or getting food, Now, if we’re together, they say things like “it’s so nice to see you not concerned about eating anymore” while I’m the only one at the table who ordered food. 

Heck, it even bothers me that my parents will bring me food, and I eat it without any thought. They like to hug me and tell me how I look so much happier these days. Oddly enough, I’m not happy that people think I’m happier.

It’s like, when I was underweight, I was really afraid of weight gain, but I was also afraid that my friends and family would think I’m content with what is happening to me in recovery. Now, that seems to be the case. I just kind of feel alone because I both want and don’t want to relapse, but it seems to be because I want people acknowledge I have an eating disorder. I want them to know how powerless I feel to stop the recovery process, and how much grief I feel toward my changing behaviours. 

It’s a mindset I’m not proud of, and I’m wondering if any people have endured something similar and can share some advice. Thank you.",nfi3vn,37,0.94,6,2021-05-18 18:23:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/nfi3vn/request_i_miss_the_care_i_got_before_i_began/,False,False,2021,5
13,Request: Question about what to do for ADHD meds that cause appetite suppression.,"Hi! I don't often use Reddit but I've heard it's a good place to talk in certain communities, so I decided to try it out. 
I don't think I have an eating disorder, and I've never been diagnosed with one, however I take medication that almost completely removes my appetite for almost 12 hours a day. I usually work around it by eating more once it wears off, but my doctor suggested finding foods that are high in calories but aren't difficult to eat, possibly small portions so I don't end up feeling sick. I tried doing research to find stuff like this, but I only found a few foods. Most of the time it would suggest foods I already know have a lot of calories, but you would need to eat quite a bit for the effect I need. I'm not sure if this is an issue with anyone else, but I do know most medications for ADHD at a high enough dosage do this, so I just wanted to see if anyone had any suggestions. If not, that's totally cool, but truly anything that people have found to help recover from Anorexia or an ED similar would probably help me. (I could be wrong ofc, that's why I'm asking though :] )

I feel so much more valid at a lower weight, and I refuse to accept the possibility of gaining any of it back, if that’s what recovery will mean for me (it’s especially difficult because I’m at a healthy weight currently, so on paper, weight gain isn’t absolutely necessary.) I’m so confused and scared of what this process will look like for me. If I start to notice weight gain in my current mental state, I genuinely think I will be a danger to myself. I’ve already noticed an increase in suicidal thoughts. Does anyone have any advice for coping with this anxiety when beginning recovery? I’m hoping and assuming it’ll get easier as I go, but for right now, I don’t feel like I can do it.",nmshw2,31,0.94,9,2021-05-28 07:39:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/nmshw2/request_advice_for_beginning_recovery/,False,False,2021,5
16,Request: 20M Do you think I have an eating disorder?,"Current situation: 20M, every few months I have a period that lasts for few days where I can’t eat (I can eat a meal a day by using cannabis to create appetite), feel mildly sick constantly, and sleepy and tired. 

Possibly relevant background: I was obese when I was little and was bullied for it. I lost a lot of weight in high school and went from obese to being a bit thin (I don’t think this was unhealthy though, because judging by my frame I’m pretty sure I’m naturally thin), through restricting calories intake. 

I am happy with my body, I think, but I do still fear gaining weight again. I do feel like I sometimes see myself ugly as soon as I notice I’ve gained weight on the scale, and better looking as soon as I see I’ve lost weight. 

I’m in the fifth day of this can’t eat period, and could’ve only eaten one meal a day so far with the use of cannabis. 

I’m very concerned about my health, and I want to know if it sounds like an eating disorder so I could go see a doctor quick. 

**I know that even if it is it still would be a mild case, and I’m sorry if this post offends anyone in any way.

Hi beautiful people! I'm a 21F looking for advice in a world that seems to have no answers. A little bit of background: I have struggled with disordered eating for a big chunk of my life but I have been committed to recovery for over 3 years now. I love the peace that recovery has brought, and I'm very scared of losing it. Nevertheless, I'm at my highest weight ever and while it doesn't necessarily bother me, all I can think of when I look in the mirror is of how my fat phobic friends and family perceive me. They make comments about how much better I looked before, and I feel the urge to go back to those behaviors just to be more visually pleasing. It might be all in my head, but I feel unsafe in this bigger body in some way. Does anyone have any thoughts or advice? Attempting ""healthy"" weight loss has never gone well for me, so intentional weightless is not an option, but I feel desperate to feel fully accepted in my community.

13,Request: I'm pretty sure my Boyfriend has an ED but I don't know what to do to help," 

Hi all,

My boyfriend was decently overweight before we started dating. He lost many many pounds very very fast over the course of 3-4 months by restrictive eating with no exercise. Though, because we were close friends at the time, and I saw him every day it didn't immediately hit me that he was losing weight extremely fast.

After those 3-4 months we started dating, and we've been together for 6 months. He's still losing weight, even though he really doesn't need to anymore. I try to be supportive and suggest regular healthy meals; but he doesn't eat more than once a day. I'm fairly sure his diet is causing him other health issues as well, but he's yet to make a doctor's appointment.

It's gotten a bit worse now since some COVID restrictions have been lifted, and he's started going to the gym on top of this. I'm just worried that this might get out of hand, and I'd rather try to stop it from getting any worse.

I know there's no possible way that he, himself, thinks he might have an eating disorder, or that his dieting is causing him these issues. If any of you have any suggestions on steps I can take to either make him aware of how dangerous this can be, or suggestions about what to do in general it'd be greatly appreciated.

15,Request: Want to stop binge-purge cycle but afraid of gaining weight,"So 1.5 years ago I was on the upper end of my BMI. I’d been trying to lose weight for a while but never had time to workout and I went out too often to have a clean diet. Quarantine however let me have the time to regularly exercise and diet which helped me to lose a good amount of weight in a few months. I didn’t realize then but realized later that I was restricting myself way too much and justifying it by saying “if you want results, you gotta work for it”. And I would binge a lot on cheat days. I later realized these are symptoms of bulimia. Earlier this year I started self-induced vomiting and that’s just made things worse. I decided to recover and so in April I stopped dieting and it was going great for 2 weeks until I took a photo w a friend on an occasion and then when I later saw it I felt like I looked fat (I probably didn’t). But that just made me go into a hate spree and I decided to diet again. And so the binge purge cycle started once again. But this is making me miserable, especially with added stress from college. I really don’t wanna be worrying about my body and food all the time. I know the right thing to do would be to stop dieting and start eating intuitively but I am so scared of gaining weight.

18,Request: How to Cope with a Friend Who is Competitive about Everything?," 

I’m currently grappling with a full fledged eating  disorder for the first time in my life, but I’m going to therapy and  really trying to overcome it. 

I have a very small circle of friends because of life circumstances.  One of these friends I see every now and then, she usually suggests  dinner or a drink which of course is extremely difficult for me. 

During the meal, she will mention several times that she either A)  did not eat at all until then, B) she worked out intensively that day,  or C) that will be all she eats for the day. 

Obviously, these comments are really triggering to me. I’m so  desperately trying to overcome my behavior of restricting food, but  whenever I’m out with her, she acts like it’s a normal part of every day  life. 

To my knowledge she does not have an eating disorder; she is just  insanely competitive about everything. In the past, she’s asked me about  how much money I make, tried to see if me and my boyfriend have gotten  in any fights, or even pried into any family issues I might be having  (her family situation is super rocky). I’ve suspected for years that she  has always tried to make things a competition between us and I can’t  stand it. 

How do you suggest I handle this situation?

I have an 11 year old daughter who has a limited number of foods she will eat. It has been like this since she was 2. Over the years the list has changed but has been very, very limited.

I don't know if a trigger warning is in order, I mean this subreddit is called Eating Disorders so idk I'm 19, my sister is 20 and she's been bulimic since she was about 14. I knew about this then and then she got better, for a while  She never spoke about it much and she helped me through depression for years but didn't speak about her own struggle really. For the last two years she and I haven't been home together so I didn't know she wasn't well again, but a few days ago we came back home for the summer and I heard her vomiting in the bathroom after dinner.. It threw me back to when we were younger and I didn't know what to do except stand rock still behind the locked door and think emptily, until she opened the door and I acted like nothing happened or I left before she opened it. So there I was again, standing there like an idiot. I want to help so bad, especially cuz she's done so much for me and I love her infinitely, But behind a locked door I couldn't really stop her from vomiting and obviously that's not a thing

3,Request: Watching Myself Lose Weight Is Triggering- Everyone Commenting On It Is Hell.,"I'm gonna try to give you the background info as quick as possible:

&#x200B;

Struggled with eating disorders my whole life, starting at about 12 or so. Really toxic family-you're familiar I'm sure. I don't want to get into the specifics of how unhealthy my relationship with food and exercise was- but I was big into pro-ana tumblr if that gives you some kind of measure of where my head was at. Somewhere in 2015/16 I started working on it and became more comfortable with food, and slowly over time I just.. abandoned all diet and exercise. I felt like I couldn't handle looking at any kind of nutrition or workout routine in a healthy way so I just tuned it all out. Not so shockingly, I ended up putting on a lot of weight. But to be honest, I didn't mind. I liked not having the stress of diet or exercise preying on my every move and destroying my mental health. I didn't love my body but I was accepting of her new look and figured it was a fair trade for not having to think about food/workingout/looking perfect all the time. That's the background story, more or less.

&#x200B;

Anyway, Completely ignoring and avoiding something is not the same as healing from it and I came to recognize that. Since 2020 I've been slowly working on making healthier choices and being a little more active. And I liked it! This year I've started doing lots of activities that I've missed and feeling really good doing them. The last time I was active, it was a means to an end- I enjoyed the results and the process was sacrifice to achieve it. I forgot how great it is to run just for the pleasure of running. Physical activity feels amazing and brings me so much happiness! And I've been healing my relationship with food, making healthy choices for health's sake while still enjoying some less-than-healthy favorites. Honestly? I'm really happy with where I'm at and how I got here. It took years and I'm only excited to see where this goes. I would love to become more physically capable so I can enjoy more achievements within my new hobbies.

&#x200B;

Here's where it gets sticky:

&#x200B;

Ana sits on my shoulder like a devil and whispers into my ear. I've noticed my own weight loss and I try not to give it too much space in my life. A part of me will always have that ED and I have to deal with that everytime I look in the mirror. That's a struggle on it's own, but one I've been managing.Everyone else, however, keeps commenting on my weight loss and its devastating. I'm aware that I've lost weight but I have been so so careful to make sure it's not a focal point for me. I don't count any calories or look at portions and I don't weigh or measure myself. I measure my progress in what I'm physically capable of. A few months ago I could barely run 3km. Last week, I ran 13km! I've put in a lot of work and I'm finally seeing progress.

&#x200B;

I said that to a friend recently: that I had run 13km and I was happy to be seeing progress and he said, ""I'll say you can see progress! That shirt's hanging off you like a tent!"" A few people joined in behind him, remarking on my weight loss, singing my praises. My heart shattered. Weight loss hadn't even occurred to me as something worth being proud of. It was just a side-effect of my hard work. There I was beaming about my accomplishment and it was inconsequential compared to how i looked.

&#x200B;

Not only do I have to work extra hard to make sure I keep my mind focused on what's important so I don't slip into a bad place- But that now that task feels impossible since it seems that everyone only cares about weight. It feels like I could run a marathon and they'd tell me how amazing I Look.

&#x200B;

At this point, I'm disheartened. I haven't even lost that much weight (posting numbers is against the rules, but believe me, it hasn't been much and it's been over the course of months) and EVERYONE comments on it. I don't have a single person in my life who hasn't brought it up. It makes me sick and honestly? It makes me want to quit doing anything just so people stop talking about my body and my weight.

&#x200B;

And I'm terrified the more I get praised and complimented for my weight loss- the louder Ana gets. The validation of people liking me and liking my appearance more is equal parts saddening and tempting. I haven't slipped up yet: I'm still eating well and I'm not over exerting myself but I am thinking about my weight and my body more. I'm finding myself longing for more weight loss- and this wasn't the case before people started commenting.

&#x200B;

I needed that off my chest, but I'm also looking for advice. It's a struggle quieting my own mind against ED... but the struggle of standing up to others and quieting their voices in my mentalscape was a challenge I wasn't prepared for. I don't think people will understand if I try to explain, but then again how can I get them to take it seriously and stop fucking talking about it?",og3ozf,86,0.99,9,2021-07-08 09:23:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/og3ozf/request_watching_myself_lose_weight_is_triggering/,False,False,2021,7
4,Request: Don't feel as though I'm deserving of recovery because I'm not underweight," 

Hello, my name is Winnie and I have been struggling with anorexia for a while.

Recently, I have made the decision to try and recover, although it has been extremely difficult without outside support to help me along the way. I'm making an effort to eat when I feel hungry, and to have foods that I want. Despite the anxiety and guilt, I try my absolute best to push through. I know that guilt isn't a useful emotion in this situation and it's not worth sitting on it.

However, I'm still having a lot of trouble about restricting myself. I feel like I'm not deserving of food as much as others. I see other people eat during recovery and I want to eat too, but I keep telling myself ""oh you can't do that, you're not underweight,"" or ""you're still trying to lose weight, you're not meant to be eating.""

The stress has been piling up endlessly, which has been enhancing my psychosis and delusions as well on top of PMS. It's unbearable, I don't know what to do.",okpbjl,80,0.98,10,2021-07-15 09:26:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/okpbjl/request_dont_feel_as_though_im_deserving_of/,False,False,2021,7
5,Request: How can I recover from an ED when nobody is on my side and I have no money," 

I (19f with autism) have had an eating disorder for about half a year- not sure how to label it, but I heavily restrict calories and am at a point where I no longer feel hungry and all food tastes bad to me… I can only manage a few bites of food I used to love because the taste is so sour in my mouth. I have also been finding whenever I eat I get bad stomach aches- not sure if that’s anxiety or if my body can’t handle food anymore.

My parents (who i still life with) are obsessive about food and have told me my whole life that I was too fat and need to eat less (I have never been overweight in my life, they just have an obsession with me being bone thin). Lately since I have lost a lot of weight they have been telling me I look good and are proud of me for losing weight. I have lightly tried to tell them that I have an eating disorder and it doesn’t help when they encourage it but I am always met with “we are just trying to make sure you’re healthy” and end up yelling at me and sometimes crying.

I am not in a position to get a job, so I cannot afford therapy, plus I don’t know how I’d get there since I don’t have a car and my parents can’t know I’m going to therapy. I am scared I am going to cause irreversible damage on my body and I don’t want to feel like this anymore. Does anyone know of free online Ed recovery or other tricks that helped them? I am desperate.

7,Request: How to stop being fatphobic?,"I love my fat friends more than I love life itself, but we have recently been discussing the fact that EDs focusing around weight are inherently fatphobic. And I see where they're coming from! I know most about anorexia and at its core, one of the diagnostic criteria is fear of gaining weight. Being afraid of becoming fat. Fatphobia.

&#x200B;

And I really, really don't know what to do at this point? I love the fat people in my life, I don't feel disgusted when I look at fat people like that guy on the fucking front page this morning, I'm a fervent supporter of healthy and any size, and.

Or what was something cringeworthy during therapy?

9,Request: Anorexia to Binge Eating," I developed anorexia at about 15 during a volatile period in my life. I went from being overweight to underweight in about 5 months. It started out with healthy weight loss but slowly devolved into anorexia. After being forced into recovery from my family, I began to gain weight. And that is all that I have done for the past 6 years. For many years I didn't acknowledge the fact that I just traded one extreme for the other. I remember being told by my therapist that I wouldn't become overweight again during recovery, the thing that I was most scared of, and he was right. I am not overweight, I am obese. It is so hard for people to understand what I am going through. It is like I still have that ravenous hunger that was supposedly only going to last for a while. I feel like my BED invalidates my struggle with anorexia and vice versa. I just want to know if anyone has had the same outcome after ""completing"" recovery.

11,Request: Exchange meal plans feel just as obsessive as restricting,"I just got put on an exchange meal plan by my dietician and I feel like trying to attempt recovery while still having to follow rigid food rules is so counterintuitive and requires me to spend just as much time thinking & obsessing about food and limiting my food choices as restricting did. Like I am still having to measure my food and weigh my proteins, I have to essentially count macros to meet my exchange goals for every meal, I have to plan out everything in advance instead of just eating what feels/sounds good.

&#x200B;

I was trying to plan a dinner to make for tonight and looking through recipes, and my meal plan calls for one fat exchange but nearly every recipe would require me to use probably more than a single tablespoon of oil, and I also wanted to make a sauce but that would also require more than one fat exchange. So I am having to choose between roasting my veggies with oil, being able to bake my tofu, or making a sauce for the dish. I could make a sauce and eat raw/steamed veggies and tofu, or cook the tofu and veggies but omit sauce and it would be dry and bland. I feel almost more limited and restricted than when I’m not following a meal plan, because at least I can eat what sounds good to me (but in smaller, controlled portions). Now I have to eat a large volume of bland food and nothing about my relationship to food changes other than the caloric intake. I am still having to view food in numerical terms, and instead of getting to enjoy my food I have to eat meals that are incoherent and still don’t feel like they resemble how normal people eat.

&#x200B;

One of the most exciting and motivating prospects of recovery for me was being able to have the freedom to cook without having to calculate every aspect of the meal and just making what sounds good, and this is not allowing me to do that. I get that there needs to be a system in place to ensure that I’m eating substantial enough portions and a balanced diet with a variety of foods but this just doesn’t feel helpful at all and I am still having to spend way too much mental energy thinking about food and feeling guilty that the things I want to eat don’t necessarily match the meal plan all the time. I feel like I’ll just end up eating the same meals every single day to avoid having to think so much about how to come up with different ways each day to fit all my exchanges at the times they’re supposed to be eaten. Has anyone had success with a different model of meal planning with their dietician? I feel so hopeless and trapped, this is the only available dietician in my area who has ED experience and this is honestly making me even less motivated to recover :(",ot6ska,42,0.99,8,2021-07-28 09:56:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ot6ska/request_exchange_meal_plans_feel_just_as/,False,False,2021,7
12,"Request: No appetite, afraid of relapse","I'm recovering from a severely broken leg (4 months post op). I'm facing another surgery next month to remove scar tissue.

&#x200B;

My doctor prescribed me Prozac because this has been hard mentally and caused a lot of trouble with anxiety (I used to cope by being active, but now I can't be active). The medication is helping me a lot, but I also think this medication has caused me to completely lose my appetite. Like I have no hunger but I can feel my stomach rumble. If I don't force myself, I can go all day just eating a cracker or piece of fruit and then something small at dinner.

&#x200B;

This has been going on for a few weeks, and I have lost weight. My physical therapist is concerned because I need to be gaining muscle in my injured leg and starting weights soon, and not losing weight.

&#x200B;

Before breaking my leg, I had really adopted a much more positive outlook on weight and nutrition. I went from being underweight and not strong to gaining weight through healthy eating and focusing on exercise and strength. Now I can't workout like I used to and it's been hard.

&#x200B;

I used to struggle with disordered eating and would restrict myself a lot. I've gotten better and gained weight since then, but this lack of appetite and weight loss now is confusing and difficult. I feel horrible for saying this, but I sort of feel myself relapsing into old habits. Although I don't have an appetite right now, I am struggling to make myself eat even though I know I need to. I think part of me finally feels in control again by being able to restrict my food intake. I need to not be doing this because I need to recover from this broken leg and I don't want to fall to bad habits again.

13,Request: I'm afraid to see a therapist because I'm afraid I'll be committed," 

I'll start by saying I'm already in contact with a therapist's office and waiting for them to get back to me once my insurance is processed. It's been two days now, so I'm going to call them tomorrow, because I think this might be the beginning of something I need to catch early.

I've always had body-image issues. I grew up with a father that made comments on my weight very often, even though I was never overweight as a child. I'm in my early twenties now, and overweight, and every time I come home, he comments in some way. Usually it's a comment on when/how much I'm eating. A few years ago, when I was a teenager, I started restricting under the recommended minimum. I stopped because I was recovering from an alcohol addiction and wanted to be honest about every aspect of my life. I've tried to lose weight more times than I count, and every time it ends in me giving up on the calorie counting and binging, sometimes for long periods, which has contributed to my weight gain. I'm told by my friends and men that ""it suits me"" and that they don't think I need to lose weight, but I cannot stop equating ""skinny"" with ""pretty."" But, more than that, now that I think about it. Worthy.

So, it started with that cycle again, just me deciding to count calories, but within the recommended range. And then I saw a pro-ED Tiktok, and then I sought out that kind of content, and started restricting far too much again. I've had physical symptoms now and it's scaring me. The thing that's scaring me the most is that I have tried to stop, and I can't. Now, the thought of food honestly fills me with dread. It truly feels easier to just be hungry than eat. I have done well these past two days, meeting the recommended minimum. I have a friend that's been checking in with me. The weird thing that's helped with it is intermittent fasting. It's like if I tell myself, ""Okay, you have to eat, and you have to eat enough, but only in this 8 hour period,"" it's doable, at least for now. But I'm terrified of what I might lower myself to tomorrow.

So I finally called a therapist. The thing is, I'm really afraid to be honest with her. I'm graduating college in a year, and it's been rough ride for me. I've been hospitalized for depression several times, and although I'm grateful that those inpatient stays saved my life, they did disrupt my life, especially my academic life. I can't bear the thought of losing what I've worked so hard for (to clarify, I'm taking classes right now to graduate on time). If I tell her how low I've been restricting (I'm trying not to use numbers, and I'm sorry if I'm getting too specific with what I have said), I'm afraid that she'll IVC me. I'm not underweight, again, I'm actually a good bit overweight, and I can't see any emergent symptoms right now - I also am not having any suicidal ideations.

I'm sorry, because I think I'm partially coming here for validation. I feel like I can't have an eating disorder because I'm overweight. I know if I were to tell my family, they would tell me that I'm ruining everything I've almost lost before, and the thing that kills me is I KNOW I am. I know why I shouldn't be doing this, and I'm still doing it. I ate enough today and yesterday, but I'm still spending so much time on those sites. And I still feel pretty when I'm hungry while I'm fasting. This is something, much like alcohol (which I haven't consumed in three years), I just don't think I know how to fix on my own. If I'm told that she probably will commit me, honestly, that's fine. I'll go and I'll be honest anyway, because I have to be alive to graduate. I just would like to know what to expect. It's also good motivation, in a macabre way, to eat enough in the days leading up to meeting with her. Any suggestions people have that have worked for them to get themselves to eat are more than welcome. I want to eat, I do, I'm just afraid of it. I'm thinking of calling my best friend and asking if I could send her my calorie counts at the end of each day for accountability, but I don't know if that's crossing boundaries too much - I don't want to make someone else feel responsible for my safety. She's a sweetheart and I know she'd say yes but I don't want to be codependent with her. I'm just trying to think of ways to stay safe until I can get some help, and I don't know that fasting is the right way to do it. That could spiral, too.

Sorry, this has gone on forever.

TL;DR - I'm going to a therapist about restricting my intake too low and I'm afraid she'll IVC me. I'm asking for experience on getting yourself to eat when you're afraid to do so, and also wondering if fasting could put me in more danger even though it's helping right now.",oc6tq1,41,1.0,7,2021-07-02 09:48:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/oc6tq1/request_im_afraid_to_see_a_therapist_because_im/,False,False,2021,7

They're quiet and they're family hasnt seemed to have intervened that much (I contacted a family member to ask about they're progress. ) me and my two other friends have tried to be gentle and ask in different ways ""what's going on?"", “how you managing?

However this isn't enough anymore. Me and my other friends are currently in discussions about what we can do but we have never been in this situation before and we don't want to overstep a boundary and ruin our relationship with him and his family.

My sister has always been a heavier person than others, this wouldn't be a problem but lately she has been eating so much fastfood and sweets, an average day would consist of not eating breakfast, heading to work, eating a burger and an iced coffee then heading off to a restaurant to eat more, and she knows that all of this food is hurting her but she doesn't try to change anything and i believe she might be depressed, her room is always a mess and she is always sleeping, on top of that any time she talks to people about her life she always talks down on herself and makes it seem uninteresting, of course this is all me just hypothesising but it seems like she treats food as an escape or a way to get instant satisfaction.

My sister has tried to go on diets and visited gyms and paid for instructors many times before but Everytime she quits after a week, any time my mother tries to tell her that she is going out to restaurants and eating too much she always goes in her room and doesn't listen to her even though she knows that she is overweight, the part that scares me is thinking of how much she would let herself go after she starts receiving money from her job, right now she is not getting paid because its only job practice for college, but once she starts getting paid she wont be restricted by an allowance so she can spend as much as she wants.

&#x200B;

Just to be clear i don't want to hate on my sister simply because she is fat, i just want her to feel better about her self and prevent any medical problems later on.",osjnmo,32,0.9,5,2021-07-27 09:39:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/osjnmo/requestmy_sister_seems_to_eat_food_only_as_a_way/,False,False,2021,7
18,Request: Girlfriend in recovery wants to lose some weight,"Hi, I'd like to ask this community for some help.

&#x200B;

My girlfriend is an anorexic in recovery. She has recently gained some weight after being weight restored for a couple of years and wants to lose a bit of the weight. I want to support her in whatever she wants her body to look like but I want to make sure she is healthy and not slipping back into dangerous habits. What can I do to help, support and just generally look out for her safety since I know food and weight are a very touchy subject for everyone, especially her.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure this is the community to ask this too but if not, if y'all could redirect me, that would be great! I really just want to help her feel as beautiful as I think she is but I would be lying if I said I wasn't worried.

0,Request: Does anyone else hate when restaurants post calories?," 

Today, my mom and I went to get dinner, and the calorie count for an item was in big, bold letters. I compared calories to something else, reflexively, and I instantly felt guilty about what I was going to be eating. I couldn’t finish my dinner and got anxious about it.

1,Request: My GF is spiralling and I'm lost on what to do.," 

I (26M) have been with my GF (26F) for almost two years now. When I met her, she was at a healthy weight, thin, but healthy.

I already knew that, a few years prior to us getting together, she was hospitalized for anorexia nervosa and low weight. She talked about it with normalcy, and it was clear she was better.

During the first few months, she ate normally, and aside from a few comments about her not being perfectly happy with her body, she was stable and mostly okay. 6 months in, she had her first real episode. She said that she was obese and that she wanted to lose X amount of weight. I discouraged it, tried to be supportive, but she was set on losing weight.

I guess at this point I have to talk about her family. Her parents are just terrible, unsupportive and judgmental. Her mother is manipulative and extremely toxic, and her father is a bigot. Their way of dealing with her being unwell is telling or forcing her to eat, calling her names, or lashing out at her.

The thing is, she cares more about what her parents have to say than anything in the world. She craves their approval (which they never give) and makes them a part of everything, knowing that they're going to make everything ten times worse.

She looked like she was getting better, but then she was diagnosed with lactose and fructose intolerance, on top of her celiac disease. This has just been devastating to her mental health and her struggle against anorexia. It started by her losing a bit of weight because her stomach hurts every time she eats, and then it spiraled out of control. To her, the weight she's lost is gone forever, not the consequence of an illness that needs to be corrected, but the start of a weight loss journey.

She's already at the point of being medically underweight, but that doesn't matter. She sets the goal of losing X amount of weight, promising that she will be happy with her body then, then she reaches that weight and moves the goalposts to an even lower weight. Recently she's said that she wants to be exactly at the weight where she's not going to be hospitalized, even though that's severely underweight by any metric.

Sometimes she weighs herself and tries to celebrate with me that she's lost weight. I don't know if that's her trying to manipulate me into enabling her or just an attention-seeking behaviour, but it always leads to her being disappointed and sad that I don't celebrate with her. I don't scold her or anything, I just mention that I wish she didn't put such an emphasis on her weight.

I also can't just try to keep her mind off her weight or weight loss in general. Anything and everything can be twisted to talk about her desire to weight less and her disgust with her body. Try to play a videogame? If the player's avatar can be customized, she will make the most underweight character possible, spending ages trying to ""get the proportions right"". Reading a book? Is any of the characters fat? What do they eat?

She also suffers from GAD and, I suspect, from depression, which she absolutely refuses to even consider. She doesn't enjoy any of her old hobbies, she can't finish books or series, she just browses TikTok endlessly. She used to love her job, now she dreads going back (she's on sick leave). I have to push her to text her best friend of ten years. This all screams ""depression"" to me, someone who has gotten better from depression myself.

She's extremely intelligent and a nurse, which allows her to hide her symptoms when she talks to her psychologist and psychiatrist. She convinces all of her healthcare providers that she's just suffering from anxiety.

I love her, and I want to spend the rest of my life with her. She's everything I could ask for in a woman, but I feel like that woman is slowly being replaced by her illness. I can count with one hand the times that we've had a genuinely good time that didn't involve sex in the last 6 months. I can't go for a walk with her, as not only she doesn't want to leave the house for anything other that driving to go grocery shopping or seeing her parents, but most she will get light-headed if she walks for five minutes.

Last year, during the pandemic, her mother was making her have an anxiety attack everyday, making her life miserable. Throwing her things away (including a gift from her late best friend, who committed suicide years ago), insulting her, shouting, and my GF even told me about an incident when her mother called her obese.

All of this led me to look for an place so we could live together and get her out of her parent's house. This has been at the expense of my own goals. I was studying to get a job that would grant me economical stability for the rest of my life, and I've put that on hold to get a job and pay rent. I've even been on sick leave myself because of migraines I think are associated with stress.

She refuses therapy or treatment on the basis that ""all therapists ask her the same things"". She found A therapist that she liked last year, and left because €70 an hour was ""too expensive"", a few months after buying a €1100 iPhone, and a few months before spending more than €1000 on an iPad, and I offered to help her pay for it despite barely making it paycheck to paycheck, and her father being loaded. Money isn't the issue, and when she feels that she works well with a therapist, she leaves. I know that's what her illness compels her to do, but I cannot help but feel like she doesn't want to get better, and will actively work against it.

Yesterday she said that she wants to have children because that would help her feel better about herself. First, even if I found that believable, which I don't, I think it's horrible to bring a baby into this world as some kind of therapy. Second, she freaks out when her period makes her look a tiny little bit bloated, and I'm genuinely terrified of how she will react to pregnancy.

I'm at my wits end. I know it is not my job to ""fix"" her, but I feel like she just wants me to enable her self-destructive habits and refuses to even make an effort to get better. I would jump in front of a train for her, but I've spent the last year trying to prevent her from jumping in front on a train herself, and I don't think I have it in me anymore. I don't know how to deal with this situation anymore.

TLDR: GF of two years is progressively getting worse, refuses treatment, refuses therapy, tries to manipulate or guilt me into enabling her, and I'm at the end of my rope.",pbw47y,80,0.98,9,2021-08-26 09:39:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/pbw47y/request_my_gf_is_spiralling_and_im_lost_on_what/,False,False,2021,8
2,What I've Learned in Recovery So Far (4 years in)," 

Hi there, (I had to break my submission into 2 messages to meet the character limit. This is Part 1 of 2 for 1 post) A friend asked me for some advice for her sister who is currently struggling with her relationship to food and her body. I compiled the following information to pass along to her and thought it might be of service to this subreddit. I hope it brings some insight!

Here is a post I shared on social media a few years ago to summarize my journey:

I debated sharing this post for a long time so please read with an open heart and mind. For years, I hated and was very concerned about my body size and shape. I went on restrictive diets, religiously counted calories and steps, compulsively over-exercised, measured everything I ate, always ordered ridiculous substitutions at restaurants, and would often binge while drinking, stressed, or starving in secret. Even at my lowest weight (nutrient deficient, bones visible, hair loss), I still hated my body and thought I could be thinner. From then on, I almost always felt fat. It is possible to have an extremely distorted self image. It took me years to hit “diet rock bottom” where I knew I needed help and have since been on my recovery journey. At first, I was terrified to let myself eat whatever I wanted. I thought I’d never stop eating and could never trust my body to know what it needed. Learning to intuitively eat is a process but it is so well worth the effort! Having stabilized my weight near my natural “set point”, I am no longer constantly starving, obsessing over food/calories/workouts, and I am so much more in tune with what my body truly needs. Diets and health culture teach us to lose touch with our body’s innate wisdom. Disordered eating comes in many forms as eating struggles and body dysmorphia affect most people (Some stats say >70% of us have some form of disordered eating) yet we seldom talk about it. The aim of this post is to share my story in hopes of helping others reexamine their relationships to food and body. I know how painful food struggles and body dissatisfaction can be and am now a huge advocate for self acceptance and rebellion against the weight loss/fitness industry and beauty ideal. We are so much more than our bodies. If any of this resonates with you, I highly suggest looking into the Food Psych Podcast, the book Intuitive Eating by Tribole/Resch, cleansing your Instagram of accounts that make you feel bad about yourself, and starting a journaling practice. \~\~\~\~

Additional reflections on what I've learned over the last 4+ years in Recovery: We live in a society that normalizes disordered eating. I used to think that either you have an eating disorder (i.e full blown anorexia or bulimia) or you are normal. When in reality, disordered eating exists on a spectrum. SO SO SO so many women (and increasingly more men) have disordered relationships to food and their body. We learn it from our mothers, friends, and the culture at large. Many women, nutritionists, doctors, and athletes have become aware of the constructed set of beliefs, norms, and practices that is referred to as “diet culture”. Examples of diet culture are: the idea that certain foods are “bad or good” or “clean or dirty” or the classic “vacation calories don’t count” or “I better be running xx miles tomorrow after this meal”, etc. The guilt and shame that is associated with allowing oneself to eat is one of the major effects of diet culture. Diet culture can be easily seen in fitness and weight loss industries but is also sneakily hidden in the general health and wellness industry. It’s a tricky realm to navigate because obviously we care about our health, but adopting diet culture’s norms and the “diet mentality” is ultimately detrimental to our health, even if it looks like making healthy choices in the short term. (More on this later.)

In order to heal from my own journey of disordered eating, chronic dieting, compulsive over exercising, and loathing my body, I dove deep into understanding the physical and psychological underworkings of my experience. It led to a massive perspective shift and profound learning around our current society, social norms, our biological needs, true self care, holistic health, and more. I have read multiple books on the topic and have listened to hundreds of hours of podcast interviews and stories with dietitians, nutritionists, psychologists, research scientists, social activists, and people in larger bodies who have been through astoundingly painful weight loss attempts and abuse from doctors/practitioners. But most importantly, I’ve lived it. I first handedly experienced the process of going from chronically dieting and hating my body to intuitively choosing foods that feel supportive in each moment, eating for the purpose of satisfaction and self care, and trusting and loving my body more than I could have ever imagined. I can confidently say that today, approximately 4.5 years after deciding I didn’t want to live my life obsessing over food, body concerns, and exercise, my relationship to food and my body is SO different. I never thought it could be so easeful and fulfilling. There is so much to learn but I can try to distill down some core facets that have really served my recovery.

**Intuitive eating:**

* This has been the most important resource for healing my relationship to food. The concept of intuitive eating was coined by 2 dietitians, and is outlined in a seminal book: Intuitive Eating, [https://www.intuitiveeating.org/](https://www.intuitiveeating.org/), the newest addition is now out and I fully recommend the accompanying workbook - Intuitive eating is a direct response to the failure of dieting. Ultimately, you’ll learn in the book that statistically speaking, diets don't work. They may deliver short term weight loss but the majority of people regain the initial weight plus MORE weight. Numerous studies have found that in general, diets result in long term weight GAIN rather than loss. This is because the body is protecting itself from famine. It’s a biological instinct to hold onto nutrients when they are restricted.
* Intuitive eating is how our bodies were designed. It’s based around identifying hunger and fullness cues, feeling into our cravings, desires, satisfaction, and practicing attunement and acceptance. It’s a practice so there will be times when you feel like you made a mistake (i.e. overeat and it will hurt, under eat and get way too hungry and maybe overeat), but that is where the acceptance part comes in. Practice self compassion, move on and try better next time! You're completely unlearning old diet behaviors/rules and learning a whole new way of living and being in your body. It takes time but it gets easier and easier and ultimately you don't even really have to think about it, it becomes so natural. Also, Intuitive Eating is not a tool for weight loss nor is it the ""hunger and fullness diet"" where you only are ""allowed"" to eat when hungry. THERE ARE NO RULES in intuitive eating. It is a personal practice based on developing an intimate relationship with your body.
* Trust is key. It’s really scary to trust your body at first. Especially if you’ve been in the diet mentality for a long time. Trust gets easier the more you practice it. And it’s so worth it.
* Binge/Restrict cycling: This was a major lightbulb for me. I used to restrict foods physically (e.g. restricting # of calories/day or avoiding sugar). Physical restriction triggers a biological craving for what is restricted. It’s within our DNA to avoid famine as was advantageous for so many of our ancestors to survive. Our bodies are created to sustain themselves. A diet is nothing more than a simulated famine. When certain food groups or nutrients in general are restricted, the body responds with intense cravings that ultimately result in binging. Out of control eating that feels scary, wrong, and shameful. My binge sessions were often triggered by stress or being drunk. Following a binge episode, we often then are very ashamed and freaked out about the amount consumed. This often leads to further restriction and the cycle continues. I lived this cycle for years.
* We can also restrict foods mentally. It’s a little trickier to understand but mental restriction is when you are telling yourself you “shouldn't” or “can’t” eat certain foods. The “good vs bad” and “clean vs dirty” food labeling are examples of mental restriction. Even if you are not physically restricting by outwardly being on a diet, mental restriction also can trigger the primal binge response. Our bodies are smarter than our minds. It’s against our biology to be denied nutrients, pleasure, and the social bonding of certain food rituals such as birthday cake or thanksgiving dinner.
* There is also the “last supper mentality” which is when you are planning to go on a diet (such as a no sugar diet or all veggie cleanse) but you have some time before starting. It’s common that your cravings will be out of control as your body tries to get as much of that food group in as it can before being restricted.
* Other Intuitive eating resources: Christy Harrison's Intuitive Eating Fundamentals Course (here), Isabel Foxen Duke's Stop Fighting Food (here), or the Fuck It Diet (here).

 

**Joyful Movement:** 

I used to approach movement as “working out” or “exercise”. Constantly counting my calories, distance, pace, and progress. In healing your relationship to food and body, it’s often recommended to reconsider your movement choices. I stopped running and doing pilates for 3+ years since those types of movement did not feel supportive for my healing. Instead, I explored ways of moving that truly felt good in my body and I approached them with no expectations of caloric exertion, etc. - Yoga, rock climbing, nature walks, and tribal fusion belly dancing are all forms of movement that make me feel embodied, joyful, and mentally refreshed. My body feels celebrated instead of punished. I also approach movement intuitively, and never force myself to do any type or amount of movement that doesn’t feel like it will serve me. I embrace rest, especially on certain days of my monthly cycle, and I feel so much more in tune with my body's needs. - There have been challenging moments where life gets so busy that there is no/little time for joyful movement. These are times when my recovery is challenged and I get to deepen my practice of acceptance, trust, and letting go of expectations. Life is very cyclical and there will always be time to regularly move again. Time for movement is a privilege that so many people do not have. I’m so grateful when time allows for joyful movement but I do not punish myself or feel guilty when I do not have the time.

**Body Image:**  


* Health at Every Size:
   * Health at Every Size (HAES) is a newly emerging concept with substantial scientific evidence to support it. In short, it is the idea that one’s body size does not indicate one’s health. Or rather, that people in larger bodies can be completely healthy even if considered “overweight”. Or that thinner does not necessarily equal healthier. (This is not to say that all people in larger bodies are healthy). You can learn about HAES at the website (here).
* It's virtually impossible to live in western society without some form of body image struggles. Working on body image and reversing fat-phobia are KEY in healing. Whenever I have a body conscious/bad body image thought, I try to recognize it as a ""negative body image thought"" and respond with something like ""I am not my body"" or ""my body does not define me"" or ""my body is my vessel"" or ""the shape of my body does not matter"" or ""all bodies are worthy of love""... I’d recommend finding some little mantras that resonate with you. Try following fat-positive social media accounts (models, athletes, influencers, etc.) that are actively celebrating diverse body types and people in larger bodies. This will help with restructuring your mindset to be less fat-phobic.
* We live in a society/economy that glorifies a body type that only a small fraction of the female population naturally has. Capitalism media/marketing has insidious psychological tactics to make you hate your body and fear being ""fat"" in order to SELL YOU THINGS (diets, exercise products, beauty products, clothes, the list goes on)! They profit off of self hatred that they instill within us - It's truly evil. We must remember that ""modern"" times are only a glimpse of human history. Women in larger bodies have been worshiped for millennia by other cultures since they saw the full feminine form as a sign of fertility, beauty, and prosperity. Try to remember that we have all been subconsciously programmed by social construction, media, and marketing to fear the fat on our bodies. There is truly NOTHING wrong with your body no matter what size it is. Journaling down these reminders and self affirmations to encourage body acceptance will help restructure your mindset. It is totally possible to create new neural networks (brain connections = thought patterns) and overcome the root cause of your struggles!

&#x200B;

**Self care practices:**  


* Healing from having a disordered relationship to food and body is so much more than just addressing the food and body relationship. There is almost always an underlying issue or set of issues that is driving the disordered behaviors. Yes, living in diet culture and fatphobia are main factors, but other factors contribute significantly. Some examples of underlying causes are: trauma (emotional, physical, etc.), unworthiness, low self esteem, perfectionism, needing to have control, escapism, self harm, etc.
* For me, my disordered eating was caused by low self esteem, unworthiness, perfectionism, and the need to have control. When life gets stressful and overwhelming, it’s an instinct to grasp for control of something. Controlling one's food and body is an accessible option. - Prioritizing self care practices that support us is key! Ways to healthily manage stress, overcome trauma, heal unworthiness wounds, and increase self love and self acceptance are CRUCIAL to healing the root causes. Joyful movement is one of these practices but others are: journaling, talk therapy, art therapy, women's circles, reading, dance, yoga, singing, sound healing, reiki, acupuncture, creativity (art, writing, etc). A book that is often recommended is the Artist's Way. One of the practices in the book is a 30 minute journaling session first thing in the morning. Stream of consciousness, brain dump on to paper. This was amazingly transformative for me. My writing sessions often consisted of me unpacking my stresses and body concerns, and reassuring myself with positive affirmations.
* So I highly recommend journaling! Journal your thoughts, feelings, emotions, etc. Practice self compassion, let yourself cry if you need to, and most of all FORGIVE yourself. We are not perfect and we are always learning. Forgiveness is huge. Explore other creativity, explore expression through dance, song, colors, cooking, whatever calls to you!

3,Request: I've begun eating normally and have started getting hungrier and hungrier.," 

Hi, I've struggled with what I believe to be an eating disorder for about a year now, although the intensity of it has fluctuated. I've recently started eating normally again, eating a regular amount of calories opposed to the amount I was eating, so about xxx more (I think I should add that I've always just fasted and worked out, never purged). But with this I've noticed I've started getting way hungrier, like usually I can last about 24 hours without eating and feel alright but since I've been eating better I can only last about 8. I guess this is just my body getting back into how it used to be but it's all happened so suddenly, and its weird because I didn't even do this with the intent to ""recover"", I've just been eating more. Is this normal? Anyone have any advice on how to deal with this increased hunger?

TL;DR: I've begun eating normally and have started getting hungrier and hungrier.

4,"Request: My (f23) Dad (m56) has an eating disorder, how do I help him?","Context: I previously have had eating disorders (bulimia + anorexia + exercise disorder ), and I’ve dealt with female friends with EDs, but I don’t know how to address it with my dad. I also have a mom, twin sister, and older brother (m25). Of the siblings I am the closest with my dad.

&#x200B;

My Dad is a no-nonsense, no-emotion, would never ask for help, would never go for counselling kind of guy. However he has lost a significant amount of weight over the summer due to his small meals, and his 3-6 hours of exercise a day. My whole family is aware of his current habits.

&#x200B;

He normally has oatmeal for breakfast, an apple or carrots for lunch, and a really small dinner (like a salad). First of all he is not even eating enough for someone his size even if the person was inactive. Second, because he works out so much he should be eating way more. He is also constantly weighing himself and bringing up his weight in conversation, saying that he thought he should have lost more weight.

&#x200B;

I want to help him, but this is different because it’s my dad, and because he has a tricky ego complex. How do I encourage healthy habits and how do in recommend that he seeks medical advice? He never likes talking about his personal life and personal thoughts, but my family and I are very concerned.

For backstory I have had an ED since I was around 16 years old (9 years). Its only gotten serious a few times, mainly my senior year and the tail end of 2018 was when I weighed my least. After a year of therapy in 2019 I started to tackle my depression and anxiety and that started to help my ED as well, even though I had trouble even with gaining a few pounds. Over the pandemic I moved out of my parents and things started to get better but at the same time they were not really. Today I am at what is considered a healthy weight for my height and age but it is the most I have ever weighed in my life and I’m having a hard time coping with it and it makes me wish I could just gain weight but still look the way I did in 2018 even though I still had body image issues then.

7,Request: Does recovering/being recovered ever get easier?,"I’ve been “in recovery” for a long time, but this year was the first time I actually started to eat more to fight my anorexia. As a result, I’ve gained a lot of weight and am objectively much healthier physically. However, I just haven’t been able to mentally accept with all of these changes. Beyond endless body distress, I feel weak for not being able to restrict like I used to, and my ravenous appetite scares me. It’s like even though I’m healthier physically, there’s a voice in my head constantly bullying me for my weight, trying to get me to restrict again or start purging. It’s really kind of scary because I haven’t been able to stop that voice at any point in recovery, and I’m beginning to fear that I never will.

8,Request: My girlfriend of 5 years has an eating disorder.," 

What can I do to help her? I'm unsure of when exactly  it started but she told me within the first 6 months of dating. She  told me her brother and others would make fun of her for being  overweight by her brother and some people at school when she was in  middle school and high school, so I can assume it started around 10  years ago since she is 25. She is like 5' 7 and maybe weighs xxx pounds (very thin)  now. Her parents know but I'm not sure to the extent, since they never  mention it. They are probably just pretending it's not a problem because  they feel bad/helpless. Heck, I'm not even sure how often she does it  because we don't live together, but I do know she has acid reflux and  sensitive teeth because of it.

9,Should we get my sister out of inpatient?,"Not from the US, but I can't find advice on this anywhere else

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Sister is getting help in public hospital but her treatment seems too restrictive and we worry it's going to make things worse**

&#x200B;

My sister(19) has been purging for months and her weight is at an all time low, also starting to showing symptoms like muscle pain, teeth problems these few weeks. From what we know she's also diagnosed with anxiety but not delusional, is very smart and highly self aware of her problems.

&#x200B;

Few days ago her counsellor advised her to be institutionalized, she agreed so we took her to a public hospital and she just got transferred to a mental unit yesterday, with her consent of course. By then all her personal items are taken away, which I understand. **Problem is they also took away her books, which to me seems very innocuous. We were told that the psychiatrist won't be able to see her until a week later. She probably won't have a counsellor aside from drugs. Also visitors are not allowed, not because of covid, but it's just a rule.**

&#x200B;

It's great to have free healthcare here and I understand inpatient treatment comes with a lot of restrictions, the lack of doctors is a sad reality we have to accept, but the book thing seems too extreme to us. But if they're giving her all this free time and not doing anything special, why can't she at least read?

&#x200B;

Is inpatient treatment supposed to be this restrictive? We're tempted to get her out of there however we can't afford private hospitals. She has always been hated the attention and will likely resent us for her stay there anyway. Should we just wait and see what happens?

I am my girlfriends only support network outside of professionals at  the moment, and a lot of her anxiety around food comes from calories. I  was wondering if anyone knew any resources to help me assist her in  overcoming this, or had any tips or tricks.

I really don't want to be a kind of barrier to her eating what she  wants, or being some sort of food moderator for her. I've looked online  and I've really struggled with finding resources on how to support.

11,Request: ED habits myth or habit?," 

Hey all. Recently I walked in on my wife self purging. Since we have had some talk related to the ED, her, and my role in her recovery. Today, maybe 7 months after, somethings still seem odd/ off but I can't keep asking her all the time.

 1) she reports it's been some time since the last purge. But she does to the bath room during meals. Now, to me, it sounds like there is a very quick like burst of water that enters the toilet then 5 seconds later the sound of a woman peeing. I thought a pre pee poop, but it's all the time. Do people with ED purge that fast?

 2) pre bed habits- again the bathroom thing, then after a flush she stands by the toilet a little long (again like 10 seconds). Brushes teeth, then flossing like crazy. She will take a shot of backing soda. Drink some water, then make a baking soda water. She reports acid reflex. 

3) does this seem like behaviors of it being a daily thing? Is it that fast or if she's in the bathroom for 45 seconds I shouldn't worry? Are these eating disorder coaches a real thing? She listens to odd pod cast sometimes and they talk about body issues (maybe positive things but I have only heard negative). Then how can I help or ask? We've been trying for a year and half for a kid and we both are ""normal"" but I don't think she told Docs about a ED. Would it be an issue if it was every now and then or is it an issue because it's more often then she tells me?

Appreciate your thoughts sorry it's a lot. I'm just looking to see if I'm super crazy or not. I am trying to change my own thoughts on this so I may better trust her to tell me the whole truth.

TW: Laxative abuse.

I’m a 37-year-old woman who has been “recovered” from bulimia for about 20 years. I say “recovered” because while I’ve stopped the daily purging, I still occasionally fall back on ED behaviors. I’m fully aware of this and won’t lie to myself.

About 2 weeks ago, I was constipated. Stimulant laxatives are a MAJOR no-no for me. Even with my sporadic disordered eating, I will not touch them.

I stupidly convinced myself that a diet tea was a better alternative. “It’s made from plant extracts,” I told myself. How bad could it be?

Really bad. Really really bad. I drank too much - like I fucking should have known I would - and now my digestive system is wrecked.

It’s been a week since I last had the tea and my stomach is still hyper sensitive. Eating anything other than binding foods sends me running to the bathroom within an hour of my meal. I can’t eat while I’m working. I can’t eat before bed.

Hi, I’ve been struggling with an eating disorder for the past twenty  years (yikes), but I have felt I’ve had a pretty good grip on my  recovery.

Hi,

 My mother has struggled with disorder eating for as long as I can remember. As for myself, I have been struggling with maintaining a healthy weight due to anxiety and OCD for the past 2 years.

I have been noticing she stares at my body when I talk to her lately. It makes me very uncomfortable. To the point that I deliberately cover up in really baggy clothes if I’m going to be interacting with her. I’ve brought it up with her, but she denies she does it. However, the last time I said something along the lines of “please stop looking at my body” she said that I had a “beautiful body”.

For parents who struggle with disordered eating, is this something that’s normal?

I’m trying to be supportive during her recovery and be there for her, but it really makes me uncomfortable and makes me not want to see her in person.

10,"Request: I have never not been underweight, but none of my doctors have ever expressed concern"," 

This is partly a response to a conversation I had with my roommate, who is plus-sized, and who expressed her frustration with the fact that she has never been able to directly address health concerns with a doctor without the doctor interrupting her concerns to discuss her weight.

Which struck me as odd, because I have been underweight for as long as I can remember, and yet no doctor has ever expressed concerns about it. And I'm not just slightly underweight either--I've always had a wide margin between me and what's considered ""normal"", to the extent that I worry about it.

I had a therapist who expressed concerns about my thought patterns regarding my weight. I've had friends who have repeatedly tried to hold interventions about my weight. But I always have to tell them: I'm not intentionally trying to lose weight, I just can't gain it.

I'm always, always cold. I swear sweaters in August. I passed out so frequently in college that I was famous for it. But even when I've gone to a doctor's and I swooned in the doctor's office and I hit the floor, in front of the nurse, the doctor still did not consider my underweight-ness a problem.

A large reason, I think, that my doctors have never brought up my weight is that I live with IBS, so I'm constantly sick and I don't have much of an appetite, digesting food can be painful, and my body doesn't absorb nutrients very well in the first place. So, whenever my weight comes up, doctors either praise me (which is probably not okay), give me the standard ""wish I had that problem"", or say that it's no problem because I'll gain weight ""eventually"". Some people just go, ""oh, get pregnant, that'll fix it"".

I feel like being underweight is one of those things that could be a risk factor for pregnancy complications so I think perhaps doctors should not recommend I do that.

My mother says I can't help it because I'm exactly like her. I inherited her intestinal distress, but my mom never eats. Never. I remember very few times in my childhood that my mother ate more than once a day. She would only ever prepare food if my father was home. And then she wouldn't eat it.

I work really hard to make myself eat. I buy foods that are easy to prepare, that are supposed to be healthy and make my intestines work. But it's still difficult to make myself interested in eating. I might go all day without bothering.

Sometimes, I'm told that my lack of interest in eating is just my depression and that the stomach upset is just my anxiety (it's definitely related). Also, whenever I express a concern about my weight, I am immediately asked about my sexual orientation. Maybe I'm being overly sensitive, because I do understand that LGBTQ+ communities are disproportionately affected by EDs, but my warning flags always go up when doctors seem a little too interested in my sexual orientation.

I've been told that being underweight is very unhealthy but I can't find much information about it. The second I search for it online, all I get are diet tips. Not helpful! The opposite of helpful! I also can't find anything about being underweight that isn't tied to eating disorders. Do they always go together?

Is it really that bad to be underweight if my weight is more or less stable? It won't change, no matter what I do. Am I stuck like this?",pif7et,34,0.97,5,2021-09-05 15:32:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/pif7et/request_i_have_never_not_been_underweight_but/,False,False,2021,9

4,Request: My partners insistence on a healthy lifestyle is triggering my ED," 

Me and my partner met about a year ago and have been dating since then. One of the things that I liked about him at the start was his positive outlook on life and his dedication to having a healthy diet, he started this lifestyle a few years ago after his ex developed diabetes from a poor diet.

I’m almost two years in recovery from an ED that consumed my early twenties, I’m the happiest I’ve ever been since I started eating normally again and I’m now a healthy weight and reasonably fit.

I told my partner about my recovery pretty early on in our relationship and he was very supportive. He said we should get healthy and fit together and I agreed, so I would eat what he ate when I stayed over at weekends and we would go for long walks together.

I didn’t realize the extent of his diet until a couple of months into our relationship. He eats absolutely no sugar and only eats fruit occasionally ‘as a treat’, everything has to be organic (which is great!) or better yet grown by himself, no fast food or anything cooked in vegetable oil, the only carbs he eats is whole grain rice etc. He obsessively checks the ingredients of anything we buy in the supermarket. We usually eat the same thing every night, some kind of fish with vegetables and occasionally a tomato sauce.

All of that is great on paper but the problem is he makes me follow this diet as well and gets very upset if I don’t, I baked a homemade loaf of bread recently and he started an argument about how unhealthy I was being. I have a sweet tooth and because of my ADHD I need caffeine regularly to be able to function normally, I’ve been sneaking out and having a soda a couple of times a week but the anxiety of getting caught gets worse every time I do it. I feel so sluggish during the day and end up binge eating when I visit family which makes me feel terrible.

I’ve tried to talk to him about this multiple times but he just doesn’t listen, I’ve said that I can feel my old ED habits creeping back in but he brushes it off and tells me I need to ‘get a grip’. I know it’s important to have a healthy diet but I also think it’s okay to sometimes enjoy a sugary drink on a night out or a piece of birthday cake but I know for a fact he start at argument at best or leave me at worst, if he ever caught me doing either.

This relationship is the best I’ve ever had and the only one I’ve ever been able to see lasting long term, I know he only acts like this because he cares about me and worries that I’ll get sick like his ex but I feel like I need to put my mental health first.

5,Request: I don't want to go into treatment because I'm terrified they'll make me restrict," 

I absolutely NEED to recover. I restrict on weekdays, then I b/p on the weekends. I'm constantly hungry, constantly thinking about food, completely obsessed with it. I'm underweight, always cold, have terrible insomnia. My tongue burns and I have near constant acid reflux due to purging. My teeth are discoloured and my skin is pale and breaks easily. I'm losing hair. I am not productive and cannot focus at work. I'm moody and irritable.

But I don't want to go into treatment. I'm already followed by therapists and dietitians and all they've done is make things worse.

I hate meal plans. They're so restrictive. They only foster my obsessive tendencies around food. I see the meal plans they usually have in treatment centers and I already feel anxious because it feels like such little food. I already restrict myself. Getting told to restrict by professionals that are supposedly there to help you recover would be heart breaking. I don't want to eat at set times. I don't want to ""learn portion control"" and ""appropriate portion sizes"" (as if I don't know that myself). I don't want to ""eat balanced meals"". I don't want to ""enforce a controlled structure"". I don't want to be surrounded by other sick people like me and exchange tips and tricks. I don't want people to give me meals that don't satisfy me and then get told that binging is bad if I ask for more. I don't want to have to choose between freaking ""exchanges"" for a snack or a meal. I don't want to eat a single fist of protein sources or whatever. I just want to actually stop having an eating disorder, stop caring about food, stop being hungry, and start eating whatever I want without restriction. But I also know that if I did that right now that would mean binging and binging and binging and that would in turn mean purging. And I don't want to purge anymore.

I also don't want to get into treatment and having to get scrutinized by a bunch of therapists who copy paste their education on me. No my ED is not about control. No I don't have trouble with my parents. No I don't feel fat. No I'm not doing this for attention. No I didn't have an unhealthy childhood. No I'm not using food to soothe my anxiety and numb unpleasant emotions. Yes I know that there is no good or bad food. Yes I know that two rice crackers is not a meal. I've been freaking screaming these things for ages and no one ever bothered to listen - I've been told that I'm in denial and that ""if I don't wanna change then no therapist will make you change"". Yes I do wanna change, I'm just scared to do so, and I'm looking for effective help and I don't feel a treatment center would be able to deliver that.

But I also no longer know the alternative. I used to think that having my own treatment team would be great but I've been repeatedly failed and now I'm worse than ever and I feel that I have no options left.",qbnll4,56,0.94,29,2021-10-19 23:19:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/qbnll4/request_i_dont_want_to_go_into_treatment_because/,False,False,2021,10
6,Request:My therapist triggered me and It made me want to get worse," 

I go to her for something else but she knows about my messed up relationship with food so every session we spend at least a small amount of time talking about it (she insisted on it so if she does care)to check up on me and make sure it doesn’t get completely out of hand.

During our last session she asked me how it was going and at some point I asked her if she thinks I have an Ed, and she responded that she thinks that it seems that it’s still a hobby to me and that I just like spending time being busy with body image and calorie tracking and that an eating disorder becomes a disorder once you physically can’t do things anymore like going to a school etc and also that I didn’t look that unhealthy anyways and damn it really messed me up 💀.

Before she said that the amount of cals I consumed a day was already like toddler sized but now even that seems too much for me and I just don’t want to eat anymore and start hating the feeling of food in my body. I already think I might have some type of b/p ana bc i am underweight now but I still binge and I already feel invalid and gross for binging but her comment straight up made it worse and now I just feel like I have to prove to her that I can get skinnier and that I can look unhealthy and part of my wants to tell her that her comment messed me up but at the same time i am just so uncomfortable talking about my struggles around food I just never want to talk about it with her again.

Our next session is on Wednesday and i am for the most part wondering if she was right about the whole Ed thing and that maybe i am just overreacting and a “wanarexic”😕Idk I just feel bad and was wondering if people here have advice for me.",q1js21,53,0.96,25,2021-10-05 00:56:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/q1js21/requestmy_therapist_triggered_me_and_it_made_me/,False,False,2021,10

3,Request: How to enjoy Thanksgiving at my bf’s family’s house when they barely eat?," 

I’m going over to my boyfriend’s family’s Thanksgiving tomorrow. This will be my first big holiday since being diagnosed with an ED and entering recovery.

This holiday is already a challenge for me, but going to his family’s place is going to make it even harder for me. Simply put: they barely eat.

You know those scenes in movies where someone cooks an extravagantly large breakfast, just for another character to take a bite of toast, say they’re stuffed, and leave? That is my boyfriend’s family to a tee.

I’ve been out to dinner with them several times. They’ll eat a small portion of whatever it is they order, then take the rest home.

His mother is the type of mom who eats a yogurt for breakfast and doesn’t eat anything else all day. He’s adopted some of these same habits, and it’s understandable: the eating patterns you’re raised around are typically the ones you eventually adopt yourself.

I want to enjoy the day and not stress about it when I inevitably feel hungry for dinner and want to eat more than they eat. I’m so stressed about this already and I can feel myself dreading what should be a nice day.

This is concerning me a little bit. I am now struggling with wanting to relapse so I no longer have that fatty area and then try again once it’s back to normal flatness.

&#x200B;

Is this a normal physical symptom to experience when in recovery?

&#x200B;

I (19) had/have bulemia and BED and since I've been trying to eat more recently because I've been going to the gym and can't make progress without protein and such but I just can't eat the same as pre Ed without feeling ill.

I can't eat anything or drink anything without being noticeably bloated, literally a glass of water and you can already see it from what I look like first thing in the morning.

When I eat I can't eat much without getting full, today I had a bagel and my brain really wanted another one because I wasn't satisfied but my stomach already hurt from just that and I couldn't eat anything else despite wanting to.

Does anyone know if this will be like this forever and I've just got to try and adapt/ build up the amount I eat?",saqxin,67,0.99,26,2022-01-23 10:40:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/saqxin/requesthas_anyone_else_damaged_the_way_their_body/,False,False,2022,1

So I recently started dating this girl who confessed to me that she used to have an eating disorder, that she would count the calories of every single thing she ate and even induced herself to vomit. I felt horrible when she confessed this to me and I tried to be as understanding as possible, and it seems I’ve done a good job, but I’m still not sure. She has expressed concerns about her looks, she has told me she is fat when she really isn’t, perhaps not skinny, but not fat at all. Also saying she has no boobs, things like that. I have told her many, many times that her body is beautiful in every way and that I think she is perfect no matter what she looks like. She has seemed to make a lot of progress, especially because she hasn’t made those kind of comments in a while. Still, I am scared to talk with her about topics like diets, calories, anything that could make her start thinking about those things again.

But I know what I've been doing. I purge after meals quite often recently. Purging has been an off-and-on thing for a while, but I only ever did it if I binged and felt WAY too full to function. It's fueled by alcohol. I know I can't get as drunk on a full stomach. Also, I know that if I get drunk, I won't eat. I know that none of this is healthy, but it feels good the next day. The weight loss is very reaffirming. I feel attractive, and tightening my belt makes me feel good. Everytime I look in the mirror, I feel like I look thinner. And it feels great.

3,How can you tell when a diet has slipped into an ED?," 

I’m 35 years old and I’ve been dieting on and off for the last 5 years. It started out as a positive thing for my health, because I’m a small framed woman (5 foot 2/157cm tall) and being at a higher weight was giving me knee pain.

Dieting “worked”: I hit a substantial weight loss goal, then moved my goal lower, and then lower again. The weight has stayed off, with a mild fluctuation here and there. Everything I’ve lost has been through restriction and periods of intense cardio. I use a food tracking app and find myself very wrapped up in the numbers each day.

Now I’m at my lowest weight, still within a healthy range for my height, but I get a sensation of being out of control when I try to eat “normally” that is, not restricting. I’m craving the control of knowing precisely how much I’m eating at all times. It makes me feel safe, in a way I can’t really explain. I want to lose even more weight in order to hit some random number in my head then I’ll feel like I’m okay.

5,I am lucky to have recovered from anorexia but I compulsively order food off delivery apps. Does anyone else have this issue?,"Cw: mentions of past eating disorder, parental abuse

I seem to engage in compulsive behaviour when it comes to ordering delivery food. It gets as bad as 3 times a day sometimes and I’m probably about 1K in debt from it (zippay). It might be an OCD compulsion, I genuinely don’t know (I also have OCD).

My parents both controlled how much i ate growing up, often not giving me enough to eat. I was an adult before I learned that you aren’t supposed to be extremely, extremely hungry before you should let yourself eat.

Both my parents have body image issues and put that on me, thinking I was overweight (looking back on old photos, I wasn’t. But even if I was this was not a suitable way to address it).

As a teenager I developed anorexia, I’m completely recovered but it was scary.

I have a much better relationship with food but the delivery food thing is a problem. I know it’s a temptation for most of us but I think I might be a bit unusual

I do still have obsessive thoughts about food and having a perfect relationship to it. I feel like I should meal plan perfectly and also that anything I cook should be perfect. Which means I definitely avoid cooking (although I like it)

5,Self-hate after doctors appointment,"A little rant/advise post here.

I am a twenty eight year-old female with a thyroid problem and have been on medication for it for a few years. I recently was asked by my family doctor (not a specialist) to get blood work done to check how my medication is helping my thyroid issue.

After getting the results I spoke to my doctor who started off the conversation saying that I am overweight and that it can affect my liver. He told me that I am a little over the recommended BMI where I should be, making me overweight, and that it can affect my liver and that my blood work shows that the blood work for my liver enzymes are a little higher than he would like them to be and talked about my weight gain again, saying that we do not really need carbs in our life anyway and to try and stay off them even if im still hungry after a meal.

The liver enzymes being higher can be due to my thyroid issues, or that is what I have been told before by other doctors, but this doctor only focused on my weight.

I have struggled with eating disorders ever since I was very young. I am on antidepressants for my anxiety, OCD and depression and I recently started therapy again. I told my doctor this and that I have a history of bulimia. He told me he was not aware and does not want to trigger me. He did not once circle back to my thyroid, the reason for me being there, and just told me to lose weight.

I left the doctors feeling embarrassed, empty, and sad. The whole day the words he said, “overweight”, kept ringing in my head. I felt worthless, embarrassed, and disgusting. I spent the rest of the day in bed crying my eyes out. I felt so horribly embarrassed of myself, and my body and I just wanted to disappear. My boyfriend made sure that I had some food that night since I had been avoiding food the rest of the day after the doctors. I felt so unworthy of the food he served me and wanted to throw it all up.

I know I have gained weight ever since the first lock down. I have not been as focused on my body but on my mental health but yesterday and today I have been obsessively looking online for the best work out apps, the best meal prep apps etc and just obsessing over losing weight. I recognize that this is the beginning of me excessively exercising and starting to not eat again.

At the height of my eating disorder, I was under weight and obsessed with working out and puking up my food. I never want to be back there again. I want to lose weight, and not let it take over my life. I have only recently started to let myself enjoy myself, enjoy food, enjoy activities I was ashamed of participating in because I didn’t want anyone to look at me.
