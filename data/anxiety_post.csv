0,How to order from subway?,I've been pretty much suffering from social anxiety all my life...but subway just gives me chills. I just can't never gather the guts to order from a subway. Can someone explain me how to place an order at subway without being judged?,fgqyxb,4835,1.0,122,2020-03-11 03:45:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/fgqyxb/how_to_order_from_subway/,False,False,2020,3
1,"I’m an italian OCD and anxiety sufferer, and I’m here to tell you that it’s going to be okay.","I know you probably don’t believe me, but it WILL get better and easier. I know it sounds scary when governments start to put out all of those limitations and lockdowns, but it’s for the better. 

If you’re starting quarantine or are obligated to stay home just like we are, I promise you’ll get used to it. And not used to it in a negative way! There are so many things you can do at home: I baked so many cakes, I’m trying to do the splits, I’m reading all the books I never got a chance to read. Isolation is reaaally not that bad.

We have the amazing power of adaptation. Every tool you have learned to cope with your anxiety will come in super handy, and you’ll see how strong you are with them. Sometimes I imagine COVID-19 as the boss level of anxiety, and it gets me super pumped lol. It makes me want to kick its ass so much.

It’s a wild ride but if us italians are riding it out, you’ll ride it out as well!
Sending you all a giant hug. We’re in this shit together.

And please, remember this pro tip: check what is necessary to check on the news. And that means check only what YOU as a citizen need to do. Numbers will go super high, then super low, then high and low again... it’s a pain that you really don’t need in your everyday life. If it’s impossible for you to resist the urge, have a trusted loved one tell you the necessary things you need to know: if there are new limitations, if you can go to school / work , what you should do with your hands etc.

EDIT: thank you so much for the awards, I really never thought this would blow up. There are so many comments, I’ll try my best to answer to the most. But as for all the compliments, THANK YOU!! You are all really sweet.

AMAZINGLY GOOD NEWS!!!!!!

A Chicago hospital that tested antibodies found 30 percent of those tested had antibodies.

https://chicagocitywire.com/stories/530092711-roseland-hospital-phlebotomist-30-of-those-tested-have-coronavirus-antibody

Magnifying this percentage to the entire USA population, that would mean the death rate for the virus is 0.015 percent, about on par with the seasonal flu. 
thanks

some really good news regarding asymptomatic spread! 

Per Wuhan Health Commission, the 300 asymptomatic carrier identified by large scale PCR testing between 15/05/2020 and 01/06/2020 have had their saliva and throat swab sample taken, and these samples have undergone isolation and incubation experiment at Chinese Academy of Science Wuhan. All samples have failed to result in incubation of live virus.

Experts believe the negative result of incubation experiments with the saliva and throat swab sample point at either minuscule viral load, or non-viable viral fragments unable to cause infection. Furthermore, samples from toothbrush, drinking cups, masks, towels and other personal effects have been taken from the 300 asymptomatic carriers, all have tested negative. On top of this, 1174 close contacts of the 300 asymptomatic carriers identified have all tested negative on PCR tests. All of these point at the conclusion that the asymptomatic carriers discovered in Wuhan are not infectious.

6,"Does anyone else get avoidance anxiety from text messages, emails, Reddit mail, any electronic correspondence?","Like I enjoy chatting with people in person, over the phone I don’t mind, either. With new people I get slight anxiety but it’s not crippling in any way. 

However, for some reason e-correspondence really gets me. Especially talking to people who are very pushy and demanding for quick replies. I don’t always feel like answering at the moment so I’ll put it off, but then I get very anxious knowing the reply is waiting for me, and I ignore it, and it makes me more anxious thinking the person is getting angry at me, and it’s a very vicious cycle. 

The only time I don’t feel this way is when I’m either very busy working (and then I use the messages as a welcome distraction) or when I take Adderall for ADHD, because then I feel very assertive and have no fear. 

I think the lock down has made things worse because now I don’t go to the gym (usual fear release) and there’s no social time to replenish my mind in preparation for online messages, since they take a lot of mental effort. 

I’m curious to see if anyone else experiences this, and hopefully I won’t avoid your replies 😆

=========

Edit: Lmao this post blew up, and now I have 40+ replies to read. The irony is astounding! But I am to hear everyone else’s experiences too. 

I was thinking more and part of it may be due to the fact that each online message represents another demand on our time and another decision we must make. At least that’s part of the issue. And diverts from our energy when already in an inert place.

14,Does anyone ever feel like they are extremely lonely but are also the one isolating yourself? (Ex: not going outside your house for days but also declining any offers to go out?),"Hi. I’ve struggled with this on and off since I was a young teen. I grew up in the suburbs with immigrant parents and one older sibling who was always out with huge groups of friends or gfs and never home. My parents never ever went out (socializing felt like a burden to them, didnt have too many friends, couldn’t spend too much money) holidays were just another day at home, never anything special. it wasn’t until the last decade now that all kids are grown and they’re retired that they started traveling the world and taking up hobbies and making friends. When I was a kid and I complained about feeling cooped up at home, they couldn’t relate to my anxiety. I always felt like my close friends always had “other groups” of friends or huge families where there was never a weekend or day they’d be home moping. always had groups of friends besides our core friend group, so on random occasions where every person was occupied, it always hit me how extremely lonely I feel.

now, as an adult it still hits me here and there. Everyone knows I’m an extreme introvert and love being home. but lately I’ll be home for 3-4 days straight, can’t bring myself to leave my 1000sq ft apt I live alone in to get the mail, take out trash, or drive to run errands as my simple “socialization for the day.” I have a bunch of things I could be doing outside, errand-wise, or at home (chore-wise, ex: decluttering closets, getting some freelance projects done, job hunting, etc.) but instead I can’t bring myself to do any of them and fixate on my loneliness. 

I let the dishes pile up, eat junk food/instant ramen, just waste hours on YouTube or the internet, sit around crying for no reason, and when people text me to hang out I decline. I don’t understand what’s going on with me, it’s like I’ve reached such a level of being a slob that I can’t bring myself to get ready in 20 min to go outside and hang. My family will even ask to have dinner or something, and the thought of having to coordinate 3 different parties and choose a restaurant and think about 5 hours of productivity I won’t get back (though let’s be real, I won’t be doing anything productive) gives me extreme anxiety.

I’m torn between wanting to bask in solitude and being miserable being so lonely. Can anyone at all relate or is this an issue specific to me since childhood? Am I just a lazy POS and that’s my problem?",fbq6n2,1325,1.0,75,2020-03-01 06:31:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/fbq6n2/does_anyone_ever_feel_like_they_are_extremely/,False,False,2020,3

It's like my body turned into a chicken.

34,Today I managed not to look away when a girl made eye contact.,"I'm usually very shy and insecure around girls. If one makes eye contact I look down or away immediately especially if I find her cute.

Today though a group of three attractive girls were walking towards me. My eyes met with one of them, I held her gaze for a second or two and she gave me the biggest most beautiful smile! It really made my day and gave me a huge confidence boost.

It made me reconsider what is it that I'm being insecure about? I'm lacking confidence and I don't even know why. Amazing what a simple smile can do!

0,Anyone else more anxious about COVID restrictions being lifted than they were about them being implemented?,"I have adapted really well to the social isolation and working from home thing.

However when I think about how I’ll have to go back to my typical 8-5 grind with a 2 hour commute on top of those hours, I feel super anxious. Anybody else in a similar boat?

You deserve to rest. I know everyone expects productivity from you right now, but it's okay to sleep longer than usual, play video games, or eat what you want.

9,Remember the 25% rule for social anxiety.,"25% of people will like you and nothing you can do will make them not like you.

25% of people won’t like you and nothing you can do will make them like you.

25% of people will like you but something you do could make them not like you.

25% of people won’t like you but something you do could make them like you.

You can’t really tell who is who in most cases and you have no control over who they are and how they react to you.

So it doesn’t make sense to try and figure it out or try to control it, just let it go. Someone’s reaction or perception of you is not your fault, just do your best and don’t let yourself get caught up using your imagination to guess what people are thinking about you.

Let me repeat the last part.

Don’t waste time and energy worrying about or assuming you know what anyone is thinking about you, using your imagination is most likely not accurate at all and especially if you have anxiety it can’t be trusted anyways.

You don’t need to respond to anything immediately, you don’t need to go out of your way to make sure someone doesn’t think the wrong thing in the majority of situations. It just doesn’t matter and it’s OK for people to be wrong!

So take a load off your mind and don’t let your imagination get the best of you.",fxc59w,1252,0.98,56,2020-04-08 18:42:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/fxc59w/remember_the_25_rule_for_social_anxiety/,False,False,2020,4

This morning, I was the only student that joined the call for the majority of the session. Another student joined about 10 minutes before the call was supposed to end. It didn't make me panic as much as I thought it would, but I did kinda panic a little bit whenever it took me too long to answer some of the activities.

I did get the chance to have a little bit of a one on one lesson to practice using words in the past tense. We have an Oral Interview coming up soon and I needed the practice because I will have to talk in the past tense. 

It also made me feel a little better about making mistakes (learning a second language is very hard). My professor was very patient when I took a little bit longer to answer some of the questions and was helpful when I couldn't remember some words.

14,Corona killed my anxiety,"Basically,  having to work from home and not go out to socialise has given my mind and body a much needed break.  

Working from home means that I don't have a lot of the job related anxiety that makes me dread Sundays and Mondays. I am also able to save on the 2 hours of commute and so I have a lot more free time.  

Not having to wake up early means I get 8 plus hours of sleep every night. I didn't realise how much lack of sleep was affecting my mood.  

Not having to go out means I no longer need to worry about my IBS related stomach problems. I also no longer feel pressured to socialise (im an introvert by nature and love staying at home and playing games / watching tv). 

With all the time I have, I finally feel like I am no longer running behind the ball, and have the time to reset, rest and do the things I love, without judgement.

20,"How being ""gifted"" led me toward anxiety and a feeling of stupidity","I was what one would call a ""gifted"" child throughout grade school. I got straight A's, took honors and AP classes, scored highly on standardized tests, even skipped a grade. I never studied for tests or struggled with homework, I just naturally retained all the information I was taught. I loved reading, I would read at least one book each week. I never procrastinated and genuinely enjoyed going to school.

All those years of performing so highly in grade school led to me and the people around me having very high expectations for my academic performance. Unfortunately for me, I found it harder and harder to meet those expectations throughout college. No matter how hard I try, I am completely unable to retain any information I learn, which frightens me because unlike grade school, this is information that will actually be pertinent to my future career. I end up procrastinating until the last minute to study or complete assignments because I am afraid of performing poorly. Whenever I try to read, it can't keep my attention. I recently took a standardized test, and I just performed ""below average to average"". All of those ""gifted"" attributes from my childhood just kind of... disappeared.

Now that I am graduating, I'm really scared for my future. I want to go into the sciences, it interests me and I care about it a lot... I'm just afraid that I'm not good enough. That I'm too stupid now. That I can't keep maintaining this image of high-performance and intelligence. I'm so afraid to try new things like research because I am afraid that I am going to fail and look stupid.

I feel like being raised as ""gifted"" has caused me to feel extremely anxious and stupid now that I am in the ""real world"". I'm curious if there is anyone else in this community that experienced a ""gifted"" childhood, or high childhood expectations, and now suffers from anxiety?

1,"Anxiety Pro Tip: Anxiety thrives on your avoidance. If you have an anxiety-provoking task to do, make it your first task of the day. Otherwise, it'll only start to feel scarier and harder to complete in your mind.","Avoiding the anxiety-provoking task feels good in the short term because your brain feels like it has avoided some kind of threat. This is one of the reasons why procrastination feels so good! However, avoiding the task just reinforces your belief that the task *is* a threatening one, so the anxiety gets more intense the next time you come to it. 

Making it your first task will eliminate this vicious cycle altogether. You'll likely feel better as you'll get a sense of achievement from ""beating"" the anxiety-provoking thing. There is also the added bonus that it won't be nagging the back of your mind for the rest of the day!

I’ve mentioned this to my husband and some friends and have been told it’s all in my head basically(in the nicest way possible). My husband will reassure me that I’ve done nothing wrong and no one is mad at me, but I usually have a really hard time shaking the feeling and sometimes it even lasts into the next day.

7,"Anyone else have ""functioning"" panic attacks where you feel awful, but can otherwise appear totally fine to others?","Apologies in advance for the long post. This is something I've been struggling with for a while, so I'm hoping that by sharing my experience, maybe I can finally legitimize what I've been going through. 

I have been having what I now know to be panic attacks since I was very young. Over the past few years, they have been getting worse and more frequent, and most often crop up when I'm out of the house (especially when I'm at work.) For a long time, I actually wasn't sure that they *were* panic attacks, because my doctors/therapists always described something very different from what I experienced.

Contrary to what I was told by my doctors, I often find that I can function (or at least appear to) perfectly well during a panic attack. My heart is racing, my hands are shaking, my chest feels tight, I feel like my knees will give out with every step I take... and yet I can take a phone call at my desk and sound totally calm and professional. I can greet clients and smile and make small talk, and no one around me can tell that something's wrong. (It's almost like I do these things on autopilot, because later, I find that I usually can't remember much of what happened or what was said.) Afterward, when I don't have to put on my ""brave face"" anymore, I feel physically and emotionally exhausted; the shaking and chills take a long time to subside, and I sometimes cry uncontrollably at trivial things. 

I suppose I should add that a lot of my anxiety rests in not wanting people to be mad at me, or not wanting to let people down. Even when I'm feeling really anxious or depressed, I have trouble asking for the time/space I need to take care of myself because I don't want to upset anyone or make them think I'm incompetent. So, I guess it makes sense that even when a panic attack comes on, I still feel compelled to push those feelings down and force myself to appear ""normal.""

I am pretty wary of speaking to doctors/therapists about these types of attacks, because on more than one occasion, I have been told that I'm totally wrong and they absolutely **cannot** be panic attacks, because if they were, I'd be hyperventilating and I wouldn't be able to control them so well. I feel like they think I'm just being overdramatic and looking for attention. Sometimes it really gets to me, and I start to worry that maybe I *am* just being dramatic and I don't ""deserve"" to call them that because there's nothing wrong with me. It's to the point where even if I'm with someone I trust (i.e. my husband or my mom) I usually don't tell them if an attack comes on because I feel like if I did, they wouldn't believe me; from the outside, I'd appear to be perfectly fine. 

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I feel really alone, so I came to you, people of Reddit, hoping that you can help me find some closure.

12,Anyone always have a show playing in the background to help anxiety?,"For me it started a few years ago when I lived by myself and I couldn't take the complete silence. It just gives me too much free brain space to focus on my other senses. With sounds in the background, it's a bit easier to drown out stuff like heart palpitations or thoughts about how scared I am. I mean, it doesn't stop anxiety and I still get anxiety attacks but it does soothe me to an extent. So if I'm by myself, I have something playing almost all the time, usually from when I wake up to when I go to sleep, but especially at night. I wonder if there's any harm in playing sounds all day long. I don't play it loud but maybe the constant stimulation has a negative effect on the brain. Either way, I can't stop now, I just get way too anxious without anything in the background and I prefer a show with people talking to a white noise machine.

So, anyone do that too? What shows do you watch? I usually just rewatch shows old favorites, and I leave new shows for when I actually want to pay attention. I've been playing Friends and Brooklyn 99 a lot recently.

Edit: This got so many replies! I appreciate everyone who took the time to comment.

but then my (well-established) struggle with loneliness and rejection = lack of value and self-worth makes me really angry offended, then sad because I feel “god I must be so terrible, that’s why people would rather not communicate with me and instead communicate with others” 

Then I reach out or try to communicate my situation gently, (even asking honestly AITA). the response is more like “Hmm tbh I haven’t really been putting effort into doing things or seeing people. Not that I don’t ask to do things but... I just am not expecting to do anything maybe? Or expecting people to do things with me? And so, if people reach out to me, that’s cool.

All of that sounds extremely healthy and understandable, so I repeat the cycle again. I can’t seem to feel normal in this world. It’s like dancing off beat all the time.

22,I am so proud of my wife,"My wife has extreme anxiety and when she does something that upsets me, that triggers it. It is super hard for me because I can never express myself in our relationship. 

Well tonight I was having a really hard day. I expressed it to her and she ignored me. She didn’t pick up on how hard my day was even though I expressed it very clearly. Later she could tell that I was even more sad and knew it had something to do with her. I didn’t want to go into detail because it would of set off a panic attack and I wouldn’t of been able to handle both my shit and her panic attack. I needed to take care of me tonight. 

So I tried to be as involved in our night as possible but let her lead and suggest what we did tonight. Obviously she could tell that my night was off and she started to become very distant. I got more upset at this because I wanted to be comforted. 

After a couple of hours she came out and said “ I know you need me tonight but I don’t know if I am strong enough.” She was talking behind a door and refused to come out. “But I just want to let you know that I love you and one day I will be able to comfort you.” 

After we kept talking she finally came out and I was able to open up and get the care and love that I needed. 

She didn’t have a panic attack. She did cry and almost went into it a couple of times but she was able to stay present and be what I needed in a partner tonight.

I would not be where I am in my life without his love. Pets hold a special place for people with anxiety.  He was there providing comfort when I had bad days. He gave me purpose when I felt I had none. He gave me unconditional love. I didn’t have to worry about my insecurities around him. He loved me as I was. He was with me when I hit my rock bottom. He was with me during my years long recovery cheering me on and providing support during the low times. He gave me companionship when I would isolate because the world was too much to take.  He was my spirit animal. He had anxiety too and took Prozac. He was excited when I got home and would cry when I left, sometimes when I even just left the room. He loved me and I loved him and I will forever miss him and cherish the blessing he was in my life.

Edit: thank you everyone for your kind words. They do provide comfort. And thank you for the golds.

90% of the time when I leave the house I get the runs. Like really bad. Almost always I have to turn back, take a shit and try again. Sometimes it doesn't work and I can't go. Not even to the grocery store for example.

I've used meds (benzos) for it for a while which usually work, but whenever I try to seek help the nr1 concern is "" well you gotta get rid of those pills "". I don't care a flying fuck if I'm injecting heroine if I manage to go to work, leave the house, do normal stuff.

Not even 1% of people can fathom the struggle some people have to just go buy groceries.

I've tried to seek help with this but every single time **only** thing I hear is "" stop using meds "". I've used benzos 3 times in past 3 weeks. I'm improving, no one cares. I'm working on my diet and excercise, no one cares. All I hear is "" stop using meds, stop using meds "". From medical professionals, family and friends.

True, meds might make it so that without them normal things become more difficult. But my goal for now is to travel to work. Any means necessary. Okay I stop meds then what ? No one gives me the step 2.

I've been unemployed for 6 months and my nr1 goal is to get a job, manage to get there and do well.

Thanks for the rant. Peace.

Edit/update:

Had a dr's appointment today.  I told her several times that my only goal is to travel to work. I said very clearly that I still need help, but I didn't care if it was in a form of benzo's, other meds or therapy.

As a result she prescribed more benzo's. And psyllium seeds.

Edit: I think it needs to be here, ‘Objectively, depression and anxiety both suck, sometimes **the change** from months long depression to anxiety, and vice versa, **feels better**. Then you realize it is not energy or motivation but anxiety, it is not calmness it is numbness from depression. I really hope you will get better and find help, because those changes between those two are sometimes very misleading, and can be a false promise.

11,UPDATE: Today I had a job interview and I managed to go. No one seems to understand that for some people it's a tremendous struggle.,"As the original post got quite a lot of attraction I'll post an update.

Original post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/gwfrjt/today\_i\_had\_a\_job\_interview\_and\_i\_managed\_to\_go/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/gwfrjt/today_i_had_a_job_interview_and_i_managed_to_go/) 

&#x200B;

Yesterday evening I got a call that they wanted me there today. I said sure, started prepping for the journey ( buses/trains are the most difficult part for me ). I ate all the right foods, slept enough, felt good. I took max dose of meds to ""guarantee"" success. 

Even with the meds and proper mindset, I was struggling at the second I left the house. Every step felt heavy, I wanted to turn back instantly. I made it to the first train then to the trainstation which had a bathroom. I had 45minutes to gather my thoughts before taking the next train to the destination.

I got on the train and things just got worse and worse and worse. Every passing stop I just wanted to jump out, crawl into a ball and cry. 2nd to last stop it became unbearable. I jumped off the train and took the next bus home. Mission failed.

I called my employer and was brutally honest about my situation. They seemed very understanding and offered to keep a 0hr contract indefinitely if I get my things together to a stage where I can reliably commute to work. So I made a good first impression and this guy seemed to appreciate honesty instead of me making up some bs lie about "" having some upper respetory symptoms "" or whatever which would've bought me some time. But I like honesty. I don't have to remember any lies and a lot of people appreciate it.

Even tho they were very kind and understandable, I feel like absolute shit right now. For past 7months my **only** goal was get a job, go there, do well. Be normal. Today even with medication I couldn't do that.

I haven't given up all hope yet and I'll start improving my diet even more and hopefully get to therapy asap. Apparently for people like me, sometimes the therapist meets half way if they know that leaving the house is difficult for the patient. Or even comes to your house. So that's great.

This was a major, major setback, but as my dad says "" You do everything you can, and that's all you can do "". I did everything. I prepared for everything.

13,Does anyone else feel anger toward their parents for “causing” their anxiety disorder?,"As I have gotten older, I have started to realize that my parents(mostly my mom) have a lot to do with my anxiety. My mom has been all over me since i’ve been a little kid. She shit talks everyone, always points out my flaws, and in general has tried to control my life. 

This has made me anxious, insecure, and have a low self esteem. I can usually circle back most of my anxiety back to how she has treated me over the years. Some of it came from bullying too of course.

My main point is that: does anyone else with a similar upbringing have any sort of anger toward their parents for some of the mental issues they might have caused? I am now almost 22 and I find myself upset with how my parents raised me. I am trying to pick up all the pieces and push myself in the right direction because in a lot of ways my parents failed. 




**Disclaimer**: let me say that I am not trying to pull a victim card here. I try my best to take responsibility for how I am and am doing my best to correct my issues. My parents have done A LOT for me over the years and I am grateful for that.

16,Anyone else suffer from driving anxiety?,"Seriously, I don’t understand how people aren’t absolutely terrified of driving. You’re inside a three-ton metal death machine surrounded by other death machines, all speeding down a narrow strip of concrete in close proximity to one another. One tiny slip up, just the slightest bit of drift, could kill or horribly maim you and everyone else around you. If you do cause a crash, you could be left dead, debilitatingly injured, or with a lifetime of guilt for hurting someone else.

I hate seeing people get mad at me when I make a mistake. I hate wincing in fear when I have to squeeze between a parked car and the opposite lane, praying I don’t hit someone. I hate when people tailgate me when I’m at the speed limit or slightly above. When I see children walking dangerously close to the road I’m terrified they’ll trip and end up under my wheels, with me not having time to brake. There are so many variables and the risks are so high. How people enjoy it is beyond me.

0,At the end of my first ever session my therapist said something I’ll never forget,"EDIT: WOW! Thank you so much guys for your kind words! I’m in the UK and have just woke up to all of this positivity. I knew reddit was an awesome place but this has just confirmed it even more. We all deserve contentment, thank you so much 💕

So after years of childhood trauma, anxiety and depression I finally got to a stage where I could afford decent therapy and had my first session today. My therapist seems really nice and her little room was the perfect environment for me to feel comfortable talking.

At the end she asked me what I wanted from therapy. As I was telling her all about me and my life, I was constantly worried about her thinking I was overreacting, judging my stories or thinking them not serious enough to require therapy and that I was just a weak person. She looked at my blankly and said ‘is it a big deal for you?’ I said, ‘yes, massively’ and she just simply replied ‘well then it’s a big deal...’, and just shrugged her shoulders and started talking about our next session.

Honestly it was like an epiphany. I realised that if something is a big deal in MY universe, then it is a big deal because it’s me that matters and someone else not thinking it’s serious does NOT invalidate that. I’m always so anxious that my problems will seem silly to someone else, but actually if they really care about helping you get through it, they won’t judge the nature of the problem but try and help you through it anyway because they know it’s a serious problem to you. Your problems are all valid and they’re all worth fixing guys, don’t ever forget that xx",hqlsf8,3454,1.0,88,2020-07-13 19:18:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/hqlsf8/at_the_end_of_my_first_ever_session_my_therapist/,False,False,2020,7

While I was playing in the garden I fell over and injured my hand. My knuckle was bleeding quite a lot and I still have a scar from the injury to this day. Crying, I ran inside to my mother.

After treating my wound, she spanked me as punishment for my mistake.

If my mother had decided to give me comfort and reassurance in these kinds of situations, maybe in my adulthood, when I made a mistake, my natural response would be to try to soothe myself and calm down.

Instead, when I make a mistake, my natural response is to feel anxiety or panic, and it's really difficult for me to calm down.

I'm hoping that this realisation will be the first step towards me being able to overwrite my childhood conditioning and learn how to treat myself with acceptance and understanding.",homwjx,1706,0.99,101,2020-07-10 10:58:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/homwjx/i_just_realised_the_reason_i_panic_when_i_make/,False,False,2020,7

Edit #3: I'm so happy i posted here! I felt so alone because I hadnt told anyone and you guys are so nice! I cant even describe how happy I am! THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!

Edit #4: As a medical student, I think it's my duty to tell you guys that the treatment for anxiety is based on therapy and medication. Anxiety is due to your negative thoughts due to any past experiences. You need therapy to fix your thought process, and that decreases or even eliminates anxiety If you have really bad anxiety, medication will help you cope. But it's not the solution because your bad thought process is still there. Meds are good to get your symptoms in control.

You need therapy in all cases of anxiety. 

You do not always need meds. Meds are for those people who are having a harder time coping with their symptoms

And your first therapist might not be amazing. You have to search for one that fits you.

Today is my birthday. I am not big on birthdays, I don't like to celebrate it and in my opinion, this day has nothing to be celebrated about, being born was neither my choice nor my accomplishment.

Anyway, I woke up this morning at around 4 am, which is not my normal time of waking up, and I had this tight feeling in my stomach and this sinking feeling in my gut like something bad was gonna happen, I don't know how to describe it.
I am not new to this feeling, I have had it for years, before every flight I had to take, no matter what time of day, before any meeting early in the morning (even if it is a casual meeting where nothing is at stake), even so much as if I had planned to do anything in the morning, I would wake up with this weird engulfing feeling. It used to happen everyday a couple of years back, but now it's reduced to only when there is ""something"" happening..any something. 

I always thought this is my anxiety but today, it's nothing today, it's a birthday but I have absolutely nothing planned, I live with my parents and they couldn't care less about this day and I really don't want to think of this day as anything special. Why the hell am I waking up with this weird thing in my gut..is this what excitement is? Am I subconsciously excited about my birthday?

1,Healthy people talk about anxiety as if it’s something you can control...,"“Just breathe!” “Think positively.” “Worrying only makes you suffer twice.” Ya know, those kinds of saying. 

I wish it was that easy. If I could control it, it wouldn’t be called an illness. 

This morning I woke up feeling perfectly fine (which is rare), was sitting on my couch reading then all of the sudden, my heart started beating so fast for no fucking reason, and I started hyperventilating. It took like 2 hours to collect myself and I had no idea what that whole episode was about.

So don’t tell me it’s something I can control, I had a panic attack while thinking about literally nothing.

Edit: Thank you to all the healthy people that replied to this post saying: “We mean well”. I get that. But it’s not helpful at all, when we’re venting and your first reaction is defensiveness.

3,Does anybody else have anxiety on your days off because you are “wasting” it doing nothing?,"I have been like this for years but I feel it’s been worse lately because of COVID and the fact that I’ve been working from home. I always felt anxious/guilty when I would relax, hangout inside and play video games on my days off by myself. I felt like I was supposed to be doing something productive, exercising the dog, etc. But I was working a more labor intensive job before. I now have a desk call center job and have been stuck working from home since March. So on my days off, if I don’t have plans, I’m still home and feel like I should be out doing something. But some weekends I just want to do nothing, even if it’s beautiful out (I usually pray for rainy days when I’m off so I feel less guilty.) I also hate the heat so when it’s too hot, I don’t want to be outside. AND I usually get house chores done on my first day off so I can relax later but I still am anxious all day because I’m relaxing and playing video games. I feel like I waste my all my days off thinking of things I SHOULD have done and then when I go back to work, I feel like I wasted all my days off thinking of things I should be doing instead of mentally relaxing. I’ve honestly found myself either drinking or getting High more on my days off just so I can forget these feelings and relax.

You are going to make it through this even if you feel like you aren't.  No matter how alone you feel, its just that, a feeling, in reality you have us all with you. This is not a journey you are taking by yourself.

Crying is not weakness, its emotion. Its empathy and you are blessed to have it in the times in which we live. Its a resource even more precious  than platinum.  We aren't broken, its the world around us that is. We just see it for what it is and care enough for those whom are cold.

Stop being so hard on yourself, you are exactly who you need to be. Don't let a day go by without telling those around you that you love them and learn to accept love from others even if you feel like you don't deserve it. You do, we all do.

One race, the human race. One love.

I have awful anxiety and always plan out my routine with at least an hour gap of having to get somewhere. But when the time comes to actually leave the house, I... can’t? Like the ability to get out of bed, to put clothes on, take my pills, to ensure I put some sort of substance into my body... is exhausting and I keep putting it off until I’m literally so late that it makes me hate myself even more. But yet the consequences of my actions aren’t as anxiety inducing now that I realize that I’m late? 

I lay there like “oh I should leave in 10 minutes but I haven’t even gotten up... what is the point?” and then drag myself out of bed, cursing myself for giving in. 

And then the entire time I’m on my way there, my depression hits and I’m beating myself up because DUH, I’m awfully late and now the other party who told me a time to meet up has to wait for my sad, pathetic self to show up. I don’t know what’s wrong with me and I don’t think this is normal?

26,Really missing the pre-COVID world when my severe anxiety was just cuz of regular trauma lmao,"Hi beautiful people ❤️ Just wanted to vent here over the same feelings everyone else probably has. 

I’ve been watching a lot of shows (haven’t we all tbh) lately and seeing people living normally onscreen makes me so sad. I’ve become so used to how we’re living now that it sometimes trips me out to see people without masks on TV. I hate that going to the grocery store gives me intense anxiety now and that Wal-Mart feels like a goddamn battle zone for me lmao. I hate how paranoid and helpless I’ve been feeling. I hate that I’m afraid to leave my house and fear every time my loved ones do too. I hate that my boyfriend and I feel like we’re in a long distance relationship when he’s only 40 minutes away haha. I hate that I can’t hold my baby cousin and see his chubby lil face. I hate that I can barely see my loved ones outside of the house and I worry about them every day. I hate that I have to plan how I can do basic things like going to the post office or going to work just to minimize exposure. I hate that the government where I live is basically useless in keeping us safe and they just keep prioritizing money over our health. I hate that almost no one in Hawai’i (where I live) is taking it seriously anymore, tourists are still coming in, and our numbers are literally tripling by the day. 

My OCD and anxiety has kicked into an intense high gear ever since this happened and it’s so emotionally draining. And it doesn’t help that every extreme precaution I take for my parents sake, they don’t follow. Whenever I get home from work or the store, it’s like a 30 minute process of sanitizing all my belongings that I brought, showering, washing my clothes, and cleaning my hands a million times. But my family doesn’t do the same so I’m worried that it’s all for nothing. We’ve luckily been ok for the most part and I feel privileged to be able to say that. I feel a little silly complaining, but as a house full of essential workers (aside from my dad who got fired from his job at the beginning of COVID after 19 years) I’m just constantly on edge. I just wanna protect all my loved ones and I feel like I can’t. And I know I can’t. I just wish I could. 

I just needed to vent because like everyone else, I just feel so drained. But I still feel lucky to have what and who I have at the same time. I just wish this was over already. It feels like it won’t ever be.",ii3u7i,1131,0.99,49,2020-08-28 09:17:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/ii3u7i/really_missing_the_precovid_world_when_my_severe/,False,False,2020,8
27,"Feels like I am constantly bracing for the next ""bad thing"" to happen to me.","Title pretty much sums it up. I feel like I can never relax, never live fully or happily, because I am simply constantly mentally preparing myself for whatever next bad thing will happen to me. For example, I finally met this pretty great person, we had a great time, and yet somehow, even when I was most happy with them, I was mentally preparing myself for the inevitable fact that it would fall apart (and it did, but, granted, that was because of lockdowns and stuff).

Health worries are also pretty prominent. Whenever I'm pretty healthy, I can never enjoy it, because I frankly am just getting ready and thinking about what next health woe will be thrown my way and how I will be miserable because of it. Even now, I have a problem where I literally can not stop thinking about worst case scenarios, regardless of likelihood. I have done everything I can -- called my specialist, set up an appointment, and will receive the next step in treatment, and I have refilled my current medication to treat it. And yet, here I am, worrying obsessively about infection or something -- despite me having this problem for three years and my worst case scenario not coming true. (\*\*knock on wood\*\*).

I can't relax. I can't stop bracing for the next bad/uncomfortable thing to happen, and even when I am doing everything I possibly can, I don't feel good enough to live my life. I am tired and miserable. I know I need a therapist, but office closures make it tough to do so, especially as I want to see one in person.

EDIT: Wow, I really had no idea this post would take off the way it did. It's funny that I used my throwaway account, for discussing some of the issues that I'm most embarrassed about, and am getting some of the best responses and best advice on.

But then my mom spoke for me (she works at the same place I do) and said I wanted another day for more hours so I was scheduled another day and only had one day off.

31,Does anyone else avoid the news these days?,"Hi, all. Is anyone else having to almost completely avoid the news right now? I almost feel like it's ""attacking"" me when I listen to it or watch it, ramping up my anxiety levels & frankly making me feel almost paranoid. I'm having to stay off Twitter entirely, and off FB as much as possible. It's all so awful most of the time, and there's nothing I can do about it. I feel a bit guilty sometimes, thinking that as an adult I've got a duty to keep up with the news, and also, as a Christian, I ought to be aware of what's going on in the world so I can at least pray for it. I have trouble even talking about certain subjects now, because it can set me down deep, dark rabbit holes and trigger a depressive episode. And, although I feel really lonely and isolated, I still need to be careful what I expose myself to - for example, a friend of mine keeps pushing really scary conspiracy theories which does my head in. I don't mind talking to her about almost anything else, but not that, as once I've spiralled down, it can be days before I haul myself up again!

I was trying to explain to my mother that I've got really burned out and feel hypersensitive. I'm not proud of myself for it, as I'm sure I'm not being very mature, but there's only so much fearmongering a person can take, and like many people (I suspect), I've been fearmongered half to death over the past few months.

These days, we're all connected 24/7 and there's almost no hiding from anything. We ""have"" to think about Covid all day, every day - we're not being allowed to put it out of our minds for even one second. When I was growing up, we had news programmes, of course, and newspapers, but somehow, it wasn't in our faces all the time & we could take a break from it. Also, the media seems to have been more trustworthy back then, even if it wasn't - at least, there wasn't all this fear of ""fake news"". Part of my problem these days is the feeling that i can't even trust what I read any more.

So I try to focus on other things: watching TV shows, knitting (I'm making soft toys to give to people to cheer them up a bit!), listening to audio books and podcasts, learning Irish on Duolingo and also praying, as I find that a comfort. It's hard though!

(I'm not saying I don't take Covid seriously, btw - I do. I wear a mask on the rare occasions I go out and keep my distance.)",ia7nas,977,0.99,104,2020-08-15 13:48:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/ia7nas/does_anyone_else_avoid_the_news_these_days/,False,False,2020,8

For example, you can search things like ""Rain city background"" or ""medieval town ambiance"" or ""crackling fireplace and rain background"", a lot of YouTubers have uploaded thousands of videos that you can just leave playing in the background.  Last night I slept to an International Space Station ambient video.

35,So I hospitalised myself,"I suffer from existential pure-o anxiety.

That means I obsessively ask a lot of deep questions about reality, and the inability to find conceivable answers causes me a great deal of paralysing anxiety.

Currently I'm obsessing about the nature of time. Did everything come into being at the, well, beginning? Has something always existed? Has that something existed in eternal time, or a timeless/changeless state until time/events began? What caused them to begin?

None of the possibilities even make sense to me, and that really disturbs me.

So I decided to go to a mental hospital. Being in the calm, orderly environment helps a bit, and the doctor is very empathetic and really tries to understand what's going on in my head.

She is trying out some medications to reduce the anxiety, and other types of therapy will also be available. Luckily I live in Europe so I don't have to pay for any of this. Though food is pretty shit. 😀

I never thought I’d be able to do this honestly. I overthink everything constantly and worry very easily and so I never thought id be able to actually handle a job.

4,You are safe,"Hey you. Hi. You are safe in this moment. I know you are scared. It makes sense that you would be scared. You’re not crazy and there is nothing wrong with you. 

Even though you are scared, you are safe. Even though you are scared, you are loved. I love you. I don’t know you, but if people can hate indiscriminately, I can love indiscriminately. I love you. There is love all around you in little, gentle ways. 

When someone smiles at you, they are sharing a small bit of love. When someone lets you pass in traffic or lets you merge, they are offering you a tiny bit of love.

Every “please” and “thank you” is love. Even when something is someone’s job - such as a store clerk wishing you a good day, or the coffee shop person chatting you up per corporate policy. They are still extending love.

Accept the little moments of love.

Accept the little moments of safety, too.

Right now, in this moment in time, you are safe.

It is okay to be afraid. I still love you. Do you love you? You must.

Hold yourself, please. Do it for me. Put your arms around yourself. Pet your face gently. Tell yourself, “I love you. You are safe. It is okay to be afraid. There is nothing wrong with you. You are human and you are feeling afraid and I am here with you.”

Do not treat yourself with contempt and do not abandon yourself for being afraid. You deserve unconditional love. Stay with yourself and be kind to yourself even though you are struggling.

Tell yourself, “I will not abandon you. I will not judge you. I will not reject you just because you are afraid.”

Keep your promise to yourself.

Tell yourself “I love you, sweetheart.”

When you are ready, share a small bit of love with others. Smile to them. Say please and thank you. Wish them well. Be kind. Let them merge in traffic. Do it without expectation for something in return.

Pick up a piece of trash because you love the park. Say, “I love you park. Let me help you feel nice. It’s okay. I got this.” (Even if you just say it in your head).

Radiate love and safety. Receive love and safety.

I love you.

6,I absolutely hate being a high-functioning person with generalized & social anxiety disorder.,"I go through my day and no one knows how much effort it takes me to fake socializing, to fake talking to people, most people just assume I'm a bitch at first until they get to know me because I don't speak up very much but when I do, I sound confident.. but only because I FORCE myself to. 

I get most things done on my checklist. I workout, I eat healthy, I have a degree, I'm in a relationship, I pay my bills, I seem like I have my shit together. But I don't. I spend most of my time over-analzying things I've said, walking around faking everything all day, worried I can't trust anyone around me and over-analzying my relationship, calling myself a loser, telling myself I'm not good enough, having PTSD flashbacks from an abusive childhood. And it's wild that no one has any idea. And I'll never let them know. Because I'm embarrassed.

So if you see someone who seems like they have their shit together or you're jealous, or you think they just don't talk to you a lot because they don't like you.. maybe consider that they are high-functioning. I think we tend to forget that depression & anxiety don't only present as not being able to get out of bed or do anything.",jgczkl,1750,0.99,126,2020-10-23 01:11:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/jgczkl/i_absolutely_hate_being_a_highfunctioning_person/,False,False,2020,10

9,I WENT TO A PARK BY MYSELF,"I’m a 26 y/o and for the first time since high school I was able to go for a walk at a public park by myself! 

Last December I tried to take my life because of my social anxiety and depression. 10 months later I was able to conquer my fears! 

I took advice from a friend as my anxiety was starting to feel uncontrollable. I started to drive to the park every morning, but couldn't get out of the car. I continued driving there every morning to attempt to make myself more comfortable with my surroundings. The morning I got out of the car I was feeling scared stepping out of the car, but as I started walking a sense of pride came over myself. I was so happy I made it this far that I continued to walk and walk and walk and got to experience a joy in myself that was long overdue!

I started to get into a routine, journaling (writing three things I love about myself, + and - things that happened throughout the day, three short term goals I want to accomplish), walking, meditating, etc. I’m just so darn proud of myself! 

One baby step at a time!

I don’t think I’m some special case or anything, I know many have it much worse. I often excuse my constant worrying by prefacing to someone that I have anxiety, and hate when they just say “oh well everyone has anxiety”. 

I know that, but sometimes, I wish someone would just say “thank you for telling me.”

But today I was feeling good, I think I had done pretty well at an Exam I was studying all week for, and it was almost the weekend.  I was in the class we're in and kept sneaking glances at her. The feeling in my gut surged when I thought about asking for her phone number. I keep thinking of reasons why I shouldn't, even though I know I wanted to. I finally just told my self ""Screw it, I'm doing it"" and threw caution to the wind, ignoring the feeling in my gut.

I asked her after class was over, and she had me give her my number and texted me afterwards. Idk if anything will come of it, but this felt like a huge milestone for me!

I posted a really nice picture of my grandparents on old school cool and it blew up. The responses were 99% positive and I got a lot of sweet messages, and there was absolutely no reason for me to even be worried. But I spent all day yesterday in a constant state of anxiety. The more traction my post got, the worst my anxiety felt. I really wish I wasn’t like this, I really hate that something so silly can trigger such a big reaction out of me.

Edit: I know it’s a small thing, but I feel really understood.

0,Can we just have a round of applause for restaurants that post their menus online,"It's sooooo much easier going to a restaurant/café/fast food joint/whatever (for the first time) when you can check out the contents and prices of their menus beforehand, and this especially comes in handy to my socially anxious peeps. Sometimes I see a restaurant that looks promising, but I chicken out because I like to have my order locked and loaded before even setting foot at the place.

Fist of all, If you have or had a shit day, I'm sorry and I hope tomorrow will be better for you. And secondly, yes, initially this was indeed another one of those essays and let me tell you I'm emotionally drained now, still anxious though of course. But instead of deleting everything because of all the ""what ifs"" and posting nothing at all I thought I'd finally write my first, rather unemotional, post on reddit (yay).

Also I'm procastinating important work stuff because I woke up with a lump in my throat and a nice slice of despair about my life -again- and have now literally been doing nothing but stalking the internet and pacing up and down, feeling bad about it (reasonable, yes). I know, there's not really much to answer on here and honestly, it's just one of those days I feel like an improper human being. I think I really need a very long hug.

7,Does anyone else get anxious when they hear any type of yelling?,"Before I start, I want to mention that I have not been diagnosed with anxiety so far, but this is the only community where I feel like I can let this out and ask this question. (Also im new to Reddit and don’t know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) 

So I’m currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I’d say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and ‘good’ kid so never got into trouble much. That’s also why I can’t recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn’t okay so I don’t think that would have affected me.

However, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn’t even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student’s name while I’m doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn’t even angry. 

Or a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn’t wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. 

My sibling who is 12 can be described as a ‘troublemaker’ I guess. They’re the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents’ nerves. They don’t listen, aren’t okay with being told “no” and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I’ve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I’d be in the same room, other times I’d be in my room and they’d be downstairs. During these times I’ll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I’m in the same room I won’t even say a word and just get up and leave because it’s too much. 

I have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really don’t understand why this happens to me

Fast forward to the next morning, I’m still anxious, I barely slept. 

I don’t smoke, barely drink but I wanna feel comfortable again.

**Edit**
I didn’t think this would get as much response as it did. 

I’ve watched my father suffer from severe panic attacks for the last 15 years. He had to retire early and it took years for him to get disability. 

I watched him every morning with crippling anxiety to where he throws up. He doesn’t even have to leave the house, as soon as he wakes up he’s sick. He’s been on Xanax for 10-12 years probably. It’s the only thing that helps him. 

As a child who witnessed what severe anxiety and panic attacks can do to a family, I never want any of my family to experience it or anyone else out there. There were times my family only made $400 a month when my dad used to make $2,000 every 2 weeks. 

Anxiety and panic attacks are an internal monster that break people down until they have nothing. It’s crappy, but true.

18,PLEASE DONT POST ABOUT YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS ON SOCIAL MEDIA WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT!!!,"My mom posted several times on her Facebook talking about my recent hospital (psych ward) stay.

“Mom, please take this down. As I said in person I would really prefer it and strongly ask that you dont talk about my mental health or my issues on your Facebook with people whom I don’t know. I love you, and no offense to anyone who’s read this post, but this information is private about me and I do not like that it has been shared without my consent. I understand your concerned for me, but this is no ones business but my own and my doctors. Thank you all for the well wishes, and have a blessed day.” 

Hopefully the embarrassment will get her to take it the fuck down. And before you ridicule me I did what I thought necessary. She needs to learn her place. She can’t go spouting my shit to everyone she meets. I won’t tolerate that shit. I’m not a minor any more, I’m a grown ass adult, and if I didn’t live in her house still she wouldn’t know a damn thing about me anymore. This shit is why I have trust issues.

Like all the air in the room is sucked out and logically you know it’s not true but your whole body and mind is telling you it’s over. Is that how it felt when you got nervous for a sec when you dropped something or forgot something?

5,The best gift I could have gotten on Christmas,"My teenage son has OCD and for the last year+ his brain has been telling him that I am “infected” so he often won’t stay in the same room as me, sometimes won’t talk to me, races away from me and won’t touch things that I’ve touched.

It’s incredibly challenging and hurts my heart.

For Christmas, he said I get a hug. I could see him taking deep breaths (subtly) and preparing himself. I asked how long I could hug him and he said as long as I wanted. When I hugged him, I asked him if I could give him a kiss, too, and he said yes, so I kissed his head.

It filled my heart with so much warmth and peace and happiness and I can still feel it a couple hours later.

I truly understand anxiety and I know just how difficult this was for him. It was the most selfless and loving and special gift I could have gotten.

Also, as a side note, my older son got me an extra gift for my stocking because I’m divorced and this is my first Christmas as a single woman. (I invited their father over last year to help them with the transition, but not this year). My son wanted to be sure I had something in my stocking since my ex always did that for me.

10,"Whatever you do, don’t believe the thoughts your anxious mind brings","I’m probably gonna delete this post later cuz of my anxiety but just wanted to give a reminder to you guys.

When your anxious, your mind thinks the worst possible scenario, not the most REALISTIC scenario. The worst possible scenario could have a <1% chance of being true but it doesn’t feel like that in the state of anxiousness.

It’s a trap, it feels like you’re gonna be stuck like this forever, which inevitably gives you more anxiety and now you’re stuck in a loop.

Its easier said than done but learning to accept that the worst case scenario can happen seems to be the best way to deal with anxiety.

Again, you’re thinking about the most unlikely, worst case scenario. No, you’re not going to go crazy, you aren’t gonna have a heart attack, your life isn’t ruined forever, you’re intrusive thoughts won’t clog your mind forever.

Paranoia. Constant worry. Incapacity of joy and calmness. All this in a loop. All of this makes me forget about my body. So it accumulates a huge amount of stress.

When my body is relaxed, my mind follows it.

I always forget about this. Always. And if I remember I don't do anything about it because I'm too busy worrying about shit.

Take a deep, really deep deep breath. Hold it. Let it go.

Dance.

Take warm or cool baths.

Comb your hair.

Drink lots of water.

Stretch.

Take sunbathes.

Hydrate your skin.

Put your feet on scented water.

Run.

Ride a bicycle.

Cry.

Walk on the rain.

Get a massage.

Feel the wind on your face.

Get a sweet hug from a loved one.

What that asshole doesn't know is 1.) I was authorized time off for my anxiety and did not need a doctor's note from him. I was genuinely seeking help and 2.) I got a second opinion from someone who took mental health more serious who gave me a doctor's note to stay out of work for 2 weeks and gave me the suggestion to talk to a therapist. 

I return to my new doctor at the end of next week to see if more time is needed or if medication needs to be prescribed for my anxiety and depression.

- Alternatively, limiting screen time (phone or television) before bed 
- Diffusing essential oils / spraying pillow before bed
- YouTube videos of distant sounds or ambient sounds
- ASMR videos
- Taking melatonin or Calm (Magnesium Citrate) before bed
- Yoga and meditation in combination or separately 
- Self-care routine before bed 
- Dedicating “worry time” and trying to talk yourself out of the anxious thought spiral early on
- Trying to dedicate your bed for sleep, rather than hanging out there when you aren’t sleepy 
- Taking CBD before bed
- Limiting caffeine and alcohol

10,hidden ways you’re keeping your body in fight or flight mode,"1. tongue cemented to the roof of your mouth? not only are you tensing your jaw, you’re constricting the muscles in your throat. this can make it feel like it’s closing, and can make you swallow more air which in turn can make your stomach hurt. let your tongue rest.

2. head feel heavy as hell? kinda dizzy and wobbly? like a band wrapped around your head?
tension headaches. your neck doesn’t wanna hold up your head anymore. before freaking yourself out. focus on your neck and shoulder muscles, are they sore as hell? move your neck around. drop your shoulders. massage them. watch how fast your head clears up.

3. feel gassy? like you need to burp or fart or something? you just might. get on your knees, put your ass in the air and relax that butt. drink club soda. do yoga. being too gassy can keep an anxious person in fight or flight. 

4. speaking of butts, are you clenching your butthole really tight for no reason? mhm. your body thinks it’s in danger. relax that thing.

5. let your damn tummy hang out. no one cares. give your guts some room to breathe. then breathe WITH that tummy, not your chest.

6. PLEASE. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. BREATHE OUT. DEEP BREATH OUT. HOLD YOUR BREATH. 
THEN BREATHE IN. YOU SHOULD BE BREATHING IN HALF AS LONG AS YOU BREATHE OUT. YOUR LUNGS KNOW WHAT TO DO, BREATHE RIGHR FOR THEM.


you can’t relax your mind if your body is not relaxed. check these off. then calm your mind. i hope they help. ❤️

I wanted to talk about breathing.  

A very common technique for coping with anxiety is to breathe deeply - you’ve probably heard this or seen it in an infographic.  This is indeed a helpful technique, but unfortunately I don’t think it is explained well and I have often seen users say that it can make their anxiety worse.  This comes as no surprise when in response to anxiety or a panic attack all you hear is “take a breath!”  Great, I’ll do that, thanks.  I’m going to break down the proper technique piece by piece in the hope that it helps someone out.  

When you are anxious many people feel like they are hyperventilating and the answer to that is because you tense up and your breathing becomes shallow and “high up” (your breaths are filling your upper lungs) which makes the anxiety worse.  You are, in fact, hyperventilating, but you can fix this.  You are in control of your breath as much as it may not feel like it in a moment of panic.  

What you want to do is called [diaphragmatic breathing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphragmatic_breathing) (or belly breaths if you’re a normal person and not in a medical profession).   To demonstrate this, sit up in a comfortable position and place a hand gently beneath your ribs and on your upper belly - concentrate on expanding this area with each inhale.  This is the breathing you are aiming for.  

What we will be doing is commonly called “[box breathing](https://imgur.com/0N53Gah)”.  

Taking belly breaths:

1. Slowly inhale on a count to four (I find through the nose most effective but breathing through the mouth will do you no harm - just keep it slow). 
1. Hold the breath for a count to 4
1. Exhale for a count to 4
1. Hold the empty lungs for a count to 4.  

Repeat until your anxiety eases or your breathing resumes a normal rhythm.  

That’s it!  I hope this explanation helps out someone, I know it certainly helped me.  Practice it when you’re calm and the next time the anxiety ramps up, give it a try.  I’ve also used this technique to steady myself for taking low-light photos and building card towers.  Bonus.  

Love, 

Remy",ktbvae,1306,1.0,132,2021-01-08 21:10:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/ktbvae/how_to_breathe_a_better_way/,False,False,2021,1
14,"Does anyone else talk to themselves and have conversations in your mind all day, everyday?","I tend to over think EVERYTHING from having to plan my trip to the store to my boyfriend not cuddling me before we go to sleep leaving me crying because I think he doesn’t love me anymore. It affects me so much in my life when sometimes it’s not even worth it, it’s just me entertaining a unrealistic thought. Everyday from the moment I wake up till I go to sleep I am talking to myself in my brain mostly it speaks negatively it makes me overthink everything I do. I am at the point where I know I am overthinking and entertaining unrealistic ideas but once it’s in my mind I can not get it out. I get these thoughts that somehow get into my mind and I won’t let go of it and keep digging at it and keeping the topic wondering in my mind all day or for days even. It can be something so small and I can’t focus on anything else but that one thing or something multiple things. I have tried to explain this feeling to people close in my life, I try to explain it as having multiple tabs open on your browser and you are running through the tabs clicking and opening every tab as if you are rushing a last minute research assignment jumping from tab from tab. Whenever i explain my over thinking they tell me “you’re just making yourself over think, you’re doing this to your self just stop overthinking” which makes no sense to me!! How can I just stop thinking?? i would love to but my brain is just always running. This happens even when I am trying to go to sleep which makes sleeping soo hard i have gone to the doctor for insomnia and depression but I have never thought these are the results and side effects of having tons of anxiety. It’s all a dangerous cycle I have fell in for years. Although at first i remember it being mostly depression and feeling of helplessness but these days it’s not even me getting anxious from being depressed because I wouldn’t say I’m depressed anymore but I just anxious, more than I ever have been. So I’m starting to see maybe it’s anxiety that is the stem for most of my other problems. I’m so tired of it effecting my everyday life.

20,Reminder: Anxiety is suffering a simulation,"The suffering is real but you're suffering a simulation. It's not real. 

It's imaginary. 

It's all lies.

A part of your own mind made it up so it can't be an actual danger.

Actual dangers come from outside you.

Fear is meant to protect you from danger. 

But when fear overworks and causes life to become a living hell, it loses its whole point of existence.

Fear isn't meant to make you suffer endlessly, it is only meant to spur you to act in defense for a short while. If you keep looping in a fear cycle, fear has defeated its own purpose and should stop functioning.

There is a reasonable amount of light fear called Eustress that is justified and keeps you on your toes in a hostile environment. Anything more than that fear, anything that paralyses you, that hinders your full functioning, that prevents you from thinking straight, that prevents you from working according to a plan, is excess fear, and by definition has defeated its own purpose. Such fear has no point existing.

The higher number of times you affirm ""I'm actually safe except for XYZ"" the the faster you will feel better.

Remember, unless you're actually in an active war zone or shooting, you;re quite safe. Say it to yourself - ""I'm actually quite safe except for XYZ"".

Finally, remember: Hot flashes, crawling ants, crampy, pain, tingling, needles and other sensations, are _discomfort_, not danger. 

Discomfort is uncomfortable, but safe.

28,Job hunting when you have an anxiety disorder...,"I honestly feel like if there was one thing that could perfectly trigger my anxiety attacks and tick all of the boxes that trigger my panic attacks, it would be job hunting. And it has.

Questioning my overall self-worth? Check.

Questioning my few skills? Check.

Panicking at long job descriptions where the words blur together from said panic and nothing makes sense because my brain stops functioning as my heart palpitates and my hands shake? Check.

Feeling like an overall failure because I don’t qualify for/get rejected from a job? Check.

Becoming overstimulated and hyperventilating from the sheer amount of positions to scroll through? Check.

“They expect *all* 45 bulletpoints of this from me? I’m not capable, I’m just a jack of all trades, my brain would explode on a daily basis, I can’t do this.” Check. 

Re-doing my resume 35 times because it’s just never *perfect* enough? Check.

Not being able to decide what I want to do with my life and thus experiencing an overwhelming desire to just give up? Check.

Catastrophizing my situation, which then turns into full blown panic attacks on a weekly basis because I haven’t heard back from any jobs and thus being convinced I’ll be unemployed forever? Check.

Job hunting is a soul-sucking experience for everyone involved. At the same time, I’m convinced it’s one of the most unbearable experiences for people who struggle with GAD. Or at least it seems to be for me.

Typing this after waking up today to find myself finally recovering from two straight days of panic attacks coupled with some fabulous depressive episodes thrown in. I was knocked completely out of commission after a week of overworking myself with the job hunt, and spent two days crying, shaking, taking Ativan when needed, and feeling like “nothing will ever be okay again”.

3,"The whole world seems excited for lockdown to end, but no one seems to be talking about those of us who are feeling anxious about normal life returning. Surely I am not on my own?","This has been a strange year for everyone, with huge life changes for all and so much sadness throughout. Even if your lockdown experience has been overly positive, you will undoubtedly have experienced any number of struggles along the way. 

My relationship with my girlfriend ended almost 2 months ago now, and whilst there have been good days and bad days, I can’t help shake this feeling of dread and anxiety over normal life returning. It’s as if life is going to take off full speed ahead and I’m going to be left in its wake, struggling to adjust to this new single way of life. 

Everything you hear on the news speaks about excitement, parties, pubs, nightclubs and all the ‘joy’ that this is going to bring, but no one seems to address the fact that it’s going to be a real struggle to adjust back into this ‘normal’ way of life for many of us.

I’m sure I’m not alone in this and I’d love to hear that others are feeling the same way x",lqt7cs,1618,0.98,127,2021-02-23 21:12:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/lqt7cs/the_whole_world_seems_excited_for_lockdown_to_end/,False,False,2021,2
4,Please start exercising,"I’ve had absolutely crippling anxiety for the past 2 years. I would end up in the ER, sometimes 2, 3, even 4 times a week because of intense panic attacks. I would have seizure like activity and the doctors thought I was having seizures when I was coming in or I had a brain bleed. It was horrible.

But recently I’ve started working out. I walk for an hour at about 3.5 MPH (brisk pace) and lift weights for about 30/40 mins. Sometimes I’ll skip lifting certain days if I’m too sore or skip walking if my shins hurt too much and use that day to self care and R.I.C.E. to avoid injury. 

When I tell you I’m a different person, I really am. Just after about a week and a half so much has changed. I haven’t had a panic attack or anxiety for about a week. I became a hypochondriac and would worry about every little thing in my body. I have chronic pain so most bodily sensations are extremely exaggerated because my nerve sensitivity. Even when I have bowel movements they can be uncomfortable for painful when most people don’t notice them. I’ve really honestly ignored a lot of them. I can go through my day with my pain pretty much fine now. I’m starting to get some of my natural humor and confidence back. Not much has really changed on the surface, but my mind has healed to what feels like years worth of therapy. 

I’m planning on continuing this, and I would recommend you start if you haven’t been already. Once you start working out you will enjoy it, as long as you ease into it and don’t overwhelm yourself. You’ll start to enjoy it and make goals. And the future will no longer be littered with fears and anxieties, but hope and motivation towards your goals. 

Best of luck to all of you!

Edit: WOAH! I had no idea this was going to explode! Thank you everyone for the awards and your kind words. I wish everyone luck. I’m sorry to anyone who said they’re unable to workout for any reason. I highly suggest trying to contact a specialist (doctor/private trainer/psychologist/therapist etc.) to help you work through any limitations you’re having. Everyone should have at least one thing they can escape to to help their anxiety. 

I do still get some anxiety working out but with time it’s subsiding. What helped the most was easing into it and making sure I was comfortable with my heart rate before trying to push myself.

Part of me wants to try new things but other parts of me know this would be just to check off some boxes and i’d be back to square one anyway.

I feel like i have no purpose and i waste my free time trying to figure out who i am instead of being able to BE who i am. I just want the world to pause until i figure it the fuck out so i dont waste another day feeling like this. this has been going on for probably a decade now.

Having a friend or my SO coming over at noon? That's right, trying not to vomit all morning and getting super bloated! By the time they arrive I often feel too sick to enjoy myself.

15,It’s honestly baffling to me that there are people who approach new experiences without crippling fear,"Seriously. I got a new job and I had my first real task earlier this week. And I spent the *entire* week in and out of anxiety attacks. Couldn’t get out of bed. But also couldn’t sleep. I felt physically ill and wanted to vomit but I couldn’t. I couldn’t eat anything except some bread that I forcefed myself just so that I could take antacids. And all I could do was sob uncontrollably and think of how much I want to die. 

Then the work task I had been dreading happened, and...my symptoms just melted away. It was almost magical. I felt so relieved but also so incredibly stupid. I *knew* nothing seriously bad could happen, that even the worst case scenario was pretty alright. But my body was just convinced I was going to die. It’s like my nervous system is a mechanical bull without an off switch and all I can do is hang on for dear life while it knocks me around and tires itself out. No chance at conversation or understanding, just mindless panic.

16,I no longer have suicidal thoughts,"Well actually I haven’t had it for maybe weeks now, not since January or early February. In my head, what started off as a thoughts of how to kill myself if I reach my suicidal phase turns into a “I want to die.” But I realize that I can’t kill myself, because I can’t do it, it’s not in me, it’s in my head but it doesn’t tell me to do it. I never attempted it and can’t even cut my arm. So I stop having it because it’s not gonna happen.

For a while, I think the reasoning behind this is because I’m a coward, I couldn’t end the pain of living so I have to live like you’re half alive and half dead at the same time. Recently, I talk about this to a lad I know, and he said that wasn’t cowardice, that was bravery. 

Because despite all the shit that happens to me and around me and in the world, I still choose to live. Despite growing up in a dysfunctional family, despite not studying that much in school and potentially not getting into college, despite the world being a shitty place where the rich gets richer where the rest burns in hell. Despite all of that odds, I’m still here. Not living fully, but still breathing, that’s a plus for me I guess, I am crawling but I am moving slowly. I went to sleep that night and give myself a smile in the dark because why not? It’s a command given by a brain, but a smile.

20,Consumed by regret after missing out on life for 26 years.,"I am 26 and have not lived. I've never learned how to swim, never learned how to drive, never had sex, never been in a relationship, and never left my hometown. I am a 15 year old in an adult body. Barely passed high school and college (<3.0 GPA). Got fired from my first professional job during college in under a year for performance issues. Graduated college and haven't found a full-time job after almost two years. Still live at home. Feel like imposter around people my age and younger in long-term relationships, marriages, and careers. 

I was diagnosed with GAD in my last year of university and have been through five therapists on-and-off over the past ten years. I was never really one to blame my upbringing for personal issues, but it's difficult not to resent my parents and society to some extent. Single mother, absent father, low-income household. The impact it's had is obvious, and I recognize the same emotional immaturity and dysfunction across my family. 

The acute anxiety I experienced in my teens and early 20's has shifted toward an increasingly all-consuming grief of my adolescence. It is becoming harder to wake up in the morning. My last hope is landing a decent job and being able to buy some lost time, but at 26+ it's hard not to feel like my inexperience is exponentially insurmountable toward developing a fulfilling career and intimate relationships. I struggle to convince myself it's not too late to live, and that if I manage to, the rest of my life will not be plagued by current regrets.",ldb1h3,979,0.99,134,2021-02-05 16:37:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/ldb1h3/consumed_by_regret_after_missing_out_on_life_for/,False,False,2021,2

I'm very emphatic too, and I usually imagen how is does the characters feels. 
Don’t get me wrong, I know what is real life and what isn’t. But I took comfort in imaginary worlds and usually overindulge in this feelings and worlds.

We all have that thought of “this looks so dumb” , “why am I doing this?” when about to post online on a subreddit, and in social media in general... 

Know all those TikTok “famous people” ?? They are human, too. They probably were sure as ducky duck scared to post online for others to view , judge , comment , like , etc.,, but now look? They are perfectly okay with posting whatever — even sometimes the silliest, stupidest things... those who comment “I wish I had the ability to do what you do” ... *You can* 

Nothing is stopping you. You are only stopping yourself! 

With one little push of a “post” could change your life.. change someones life, emotions, thinking process.. think its scary , right?! It is!!

Yes , anxiety...other mental illnesses... but THOSE DO NOT DEFINE YOU. You are more than your mental illness. Don’t be afraid to do what you love, and keep doin it! 

I am with you every step of the day. 

Together, we will both live our “dream life” ... take care, sendin prayers that you have a good life!",mcs4fd,1071,0.98,112,2021-03-25 06:54:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/mcs4fd/nobody_will_probably_read_this_but_if_you_do/,False,False,2021,3

14,"I hate how, since we were young, society has engraved on us that we should have our lives figured out on our 20s.","I've been living like a robot these past few days and I've been telling myself to numb everything so I wouldn't get hurt. How nice would it actually be to not think and feel at all huh. It doesn't help that the people around me see this robot as a 'strong' person who can stay composed at the face of adversity. I'm not strong and I wish I can just yell it out but that would cause more pain within the family that would only end with one affected party, which is, *surprise surprise,* me. I don't have my life figured out at 20 and my mind is very persistent in chasing this hourglass time limit of succeeding in life.

There is a lot of nostalgia attached to these items, so they also feel comforting in a way.

But I've started to think if I may reduce my anxiety by simplifying, as the things also seem to take up a lot of mental energy for me.

I notice when I've been out biking/walking that my anxiety increases a lot when coming back to my house.

Society treats those who are anxious or timid like garbage, play things to troll and fuck with.

People are animals, if you show even the slightest nervousness they pounce, they double down and try to stress you more, or laugh at you, ect. I've seen this from young, middle aged and old, from people of all cultures and background, it's absolutely disgraceful.

I want to get into writing more, but when I show someone what I wrote, if I get anything more than ""nice"" or ""cool"" then I start having bad anxiety. I understand that having your own work criticized is extremely important to grow in just about any aspect, but I am absolutely terrified of it. If I get any positive feedback, I think I didn't earn it or that I'm being patronized. If I get negative feedback in any way, shape or form, I'm extremely discouraged and get too depressed to put in more effort to fix my mistakes, which leads to worse results and therefore worse criticism, and the cycle starts again. 

Or even worse, I'll just straight up refuse to ask anyone for feedback and then when I finally do work up enough courage to ask, it'll be I'm an objectively inferior state than it was before.

0,My Uber driver had a panic attack mid-ride. Here's what happened.,"It was early afternoon and I had summoned an Uber driver from my home to take me to a friends house to watch some basketball about 25-30 minutes away.

He arrives, greetings were fine, asked me how my day was, standard stuff. Not much talking between us, and honestly I don't mind. Car was clean as well!

&#x200B;

About 20 minutes into our drive I notice he's sort of glancing in the rearview at me like he wants to say something, he starts kind of breathing deep breaths and says: ""Sorry I have to pull over."" I reply: ""Ok is everything alright?."" He says ""Sorry having a panic attack.""

I remained calm and told him, ""Ok that's fine man, I have panic attacks too, I'm not going anywhere important, take your time.""

Luckily he was able to pullover, we were in a residential area with a hill next to us and side walk.

He wasn't really speaking much at this point and I told him: ""I know when I have these attacks I like to be alone, don't worry I'm not in a hurry, I'll be over here on the curb playing games on my phone take your time, let me know if you want to call anyone.""

&#x200B;

About 20-30 minutes later, I told him I could drive him the rest of the way so he could finish his trip and make money, he said to give him a few more minutes. He was able to calm down enough to drive us. We arrived fine, I tipped him told him this is my number if he needs to talk with someone with anxiety as well and went on our ways. I think fresh air and giving him space helped him instead of worrying about finishing his trip with me. Anyways just a small story I had today.

3,"I had a panic attack while driving, pulled over off the road to stay safe, and someone hit me at full speed while texting and driving. My car was totaled.","I've been diagnosed with GAD and have had a few pretty bad panic attacks in my life. Last night I was driving from my old apartment to my first house I just bought with the last load of my house plants (I had about 35 in the car, it's a hobby of mine).

For some reason I'm still unsure of, I started having a panic attack. My heart rate went up, the pit of my stomach dropped, I felt woozy, broke out in cold sweat, and felt extremely anxious. Right before going onto the highway, I pulled to the side off the road with my hazards on to give myself time to come down off of this panic attack. I called my partner, who was at the house, and told him I was having a panic attack and he  worked with me to help me get grounded and calm. 

I ended the call after about 8 minutes and told him I would call him back when I felt good to drive again. The intensity of the attack was coming in waves at this point, but it was gradually lessening. Less than 2 minutes after the call ended, someone rammed full speed into the back of my car. My car was lurched forward with an awful crunch, plant dirt and debris flew every where, I was thrown forward but my seat belt caught me. I was OFF the road to the side with my hazards on, this guy had to have somehow swerved and not seen my car to have hit me. 

I had no immediate injuries, but I was terrified. I've never heard myself scream like that. The panic attack I had almost gotten under control was now replaced with absolute mayhem of fear and pure adrenaline. The guy came out of his car and approached mine, I was already on the phone with police. He kept trying to give me his license and saying he was going to give me his insurance info. I was sobbing and telling him to wait I'm on the phone with the police. He handed me his license, so I took a picture of it while trying to describe to the location to the 911 operator. He took his license and drove off without getting his insurance. He spoke not great English and I think he was terrified and didn't know what to do. 

The police came with an ambulance. They took my vitals. I had no pain in my neck, back, stomach, or any where. I told the police what happened and showed them the pic of this guy's license. They were like ""WTF this guy gave you his license but not his insurance and drove off?"" That is a hit and run felony. I think the guy was trying to do the right thing but got scared and fled. The police caught him in about 30 mins. Turns out a car with a lot of front damage can't get very far.

My car was totaled, the back wheel was completely torn off and the back axel was twisted beyond repair. Many of my house plant's pots had shattered immediately. I had to leave half of them in the car as it got taken to an impound lot because there wasn't enough room in my friend's car who came and picked me up. I loved this car so much, it saved my fucking life. I was beside myself seeing it being towed away, broken beyond repair, with some of my beautiful house plants still in it. 

I am fully covered for by insurance so they will be paying me out for the value of my car. I will be able to go to the impound lot to get the remainder of my plants and belongings. 

What just strikes me as so fucking cruel was that I had a panic attack and chose to safely move off the road to not put myself or other drivers in danger, and I still got hit and my car was totaled. 

I'm so grateful to still be alive and not in tjr hospital. But I'm scared about what this means for me and my anxiety moving forward. Will I have PTSD from this? Will I be scared of driving/cars moving forward?",n1smxe,1754,0.99,109,2021-04-30 12:19:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n1smxe/i_had_a_panic_attack_while_driving_pulled_over/,False,False,2021,4
4,My therapist gave me some information that was a game changer.,"It was another day at therapy. Going thru the motions and questions, feeling like I was making now progress and pretty much wasting my time down a dead end road. I was telling her how much I hate to pick up phone calls, hate doctors appointments, hate social gatherings, etc. She asked me why I hated them. And for me, it’s just plain uncomfortable. My mind goes to: who’s thinking this about me? why is this person calling me? Why do I have to do more bloodwork? If I don’t put myself in those situations, I don’t have to worry about all those things. 

She says, that’s good! You’re beginning to see the root problem is discomfort. Comfort is something we naturally seek. It’s built in our DNA. BUT! Comfort all the time has a price. Just like too much of anything; coffee, sugar, working out, alcohol. You’ve trained your mind to view discomfort as an enemy. The feeling of discomfort isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In some cases it can be, but in some cases it’s the process of growth. It’s like growing pains. Sure you feel achey but your body is in the process of moving to something better. It’s completely fine to feel discomfort when you start to actually pick up the phone, actually go out and get an oil change, or putting yourself out there to your friends. But the more you do it, the more you’ll realize you can do. And the less it will be in the form of discomfort. Give yourself room to fail sometimes but by all means continue forward. 

It took me a few weeks to think about and process this information until I decided to be brave enough to try. And I have to say, I’m glad I did. Just like she said, I began to see I COULD. And it’s been a game changer.

8,Does anyone else feel most of their anxiety would dissipate if society would just lay off?,The majority of my anxiety is driven by societal expectations. I don't have a license because I hate driving...an expectation that didn't even exist before the 1900s. I hated school and struggle with work because I constantly feel I'm not smart enough for the task. I hate money and insurance because I never have enough. I hate appointments and social gatherings because people expect me to appear normal and put-together.

I rehearsed my opening line and all possible outcomes. I considered just not calling, but told myself ""NO this is important, you can do this!""

I finally press the call button and the signal sound makes me even more anxious. I keep breathing and rehearsing.

And then they just... don't pick up.

One of my coworkers said “It’s ok, breathe in, breathe out”. Later, she came up to me and asked if I had anxiety. I said yes, I’ve had it since I was 7.

21,I ate after 5 days.,"I knew it was time to eat. I have emetophobia ( the fear of vomit ) & it has stopped me from eating for the last 5 days.

Today, I was going to go another day without eating to avoid a panic attack. But enough was enough.

I had a few fries, a chicken nugget & 3 bites of a burger. It wasn't much, but it was something & I'm so happy. 

It was hard to swallow & chew, but I managed to do so calmly :) I go to the doctors tommorow to get anxiety medication as well!!

UPDATE : I got the medication. Before taking it, I was having mini snacks like smoothies & crisps. Then for dinner my mum brought home KFC & I could barely eat it. So I decided to take the first pill, very worried.

At first I was confused as to how to feel about it, I just felt numb. But then I started eating, without a thought in my head. No nausea, no dry throat, no rapid heartbeat. I ate my first BIG meal & feel no guilt. I truly feel like I've found myself again.

24,Don’t trust your anxiety! Today I got proof it isn’t always right.,"Today I had to do a big presentation at work to some important people. I was quite anxious as I’m still fairly new-ish to the job and still feel like a huge imposter. I’ve also got a new manager who sat in on the presentation to check everything went okay. 
I did it and when I came out the other side my anxiety was telling me it went terribly. Though I tried not to show it, throughout the presentation, the anxiety was saying, “oh god, you’re bombing, end it so the audience can stop feeling awkward and embarrassed for you.” I was sure that my manager must be quite disappointed. I fully expected to get a call from her to go over what went wrong and how to improve. 

Instead, she copied me in to an email between her and her boss giving me a “shout out” because I handled the tough questions “like a pro, giving extremely confident and good answers.” She also added that at the end, the head of department of the client I was presenting to had said the presentation was “one of the best” he’d seen and he’d found it “extremely useful and insightful”. 

I feel like she and I were at totally different presentations but it just goes to show, your anxiety is not always right about the situation and your perception does not always align with everyone else’s. 
Ignore the anxiety voice and just keep on going!

I also have bad health anxiety so maybe focusing on it has been making me feel weird. I’m not sure. 

Does anyone else get random heat palpitations, the need to take big breaths and do breathing exercises, and also the feeling of not wanting to do anything? 

I contacted my doctor cause the heart palpitations and the need for breathing exercises usually happen at night.  
But I have to wait two weeks to have a 10 min phone call with my doctor. 

The only times I’ve ever felt this way were times when I was having such bad anxiety, but I don’t recall the heart palpitations. 

But like I said, I don’t have reasons to be THIS anxious.. unless I just don’t realize that I am actually this anxious.

I am **SO** proud of myself, and I know only people with anxiety will be able to appreciate the strength this took and how much of a victory it is! 

I have always had a severe needle phobia (avoided HPV vaccine in school, flu shot, refused tetanus and refused all blood tests). It got to a point where I had to get my flu shot up my nose as a spray every year (ridiculous, I know. but the phobia was deeply ingrained into me)

I knew I would finally have to face my phobia again with the COVID vaccine. Because I knew if I freaked out and just avoided it, it wouldn't be just me I was endangering. Since the start of the year, the vaccine is all I've been thinking about. I was *dreading* getting that text message to say it was my turn. And then I was having several panic attacks a day leading up to the appointment. It was pretty rough.

When the nurse called me in and sat me down, it felt like I was going to pass out or puke or burst into tears... but then I just had this... surreal moment of clarity. I just focused on one of the wall tiles and just... almost tuned out of the situation. And then I felt it go in, and it hurt and I was terrified, but also strangely empowered? Like I couldn't believe I actually got to this exact moment without losing it and running out. 

I felt dizzy with relief and happiness when it was over, I think the nurse probably thought I was crazy haha. I'm just so damn proud I've faced one of my fears. My arm is pretty sore a day later, but I'm doing just fine!

8,My therapist recently taught me a trick that has been actually changing my life,"It's pretty simple and may seem obvious, but just make up your mind. That's it. Think about a thing, take in all the factors/risks, then *decide* what you're going to do. 

Don't question it after that. You already know you spent the time ruminating over it, you already took in every detail, now stop the cycle of over/repetitive thinking and decide. I know it's easier said than done, but with some practice this can be so helpful. 

Most fear/anxiety comes from the unknown, yeah? I think many people agree about that. We can never be sure what will happen in a future situation, so we tend to spin it *over* and *over* and *over* for no reason. Spinning it again won't make the answer any clearer, just make up your mind and stop. You'll see what happens when you get there, all that you can control is what *you* do leading up to it. 

I really hope this can help some of you. I've struggled with GAD and many phobias/panic attacks for years. This has been the most impactful trick that I've used.

I have been handling my anxiety quite well over the last few months after having figured out some of my major trigger. With numbers going down in my city, restaurants are opening back up and people want to meet and socialize I have felt much more anxious over the last few days. 

I got quite comfortable in my covid routing and bubble over the last year. It hasn't taken all of the anxiety away but reduced the social aspect by a lot (maybe not to my long term advantage though). 

I have vacation time planned in the next few weeks and just had an anxiety attack over planning on where to go/what to do for just a couple of days. Last year a friend and I planned to take a trip together, which we now had to cancel because I could not get vaccinated early enough. Now we want to spend the time together in some other way and while trying to find some options closer to home I realized what I have been so anxious about. Going out, meeting other people, stepping out of my routine and comfort zone. Its crazy. I used to thrive with travel and new cultures/people and today I caught myself hoping that guidelines won't be relaxed so that I have a good excuse to stay in my bubble.... 

I have honestly no idea what to do with this. I need to stay careful and take precautions for my physical health (pre-existing conditions) while I cannot neglect my mental health but am not sure if its better to just go for it or let my anxiety dictate my vacation plans and social life again....

I've seen quite a lot of people asking about how I got here. The thing is, I don't have a simple answer (although I guess the answer to anxiety is never simple).

If it wasn't for my lovely SO I wouldn't have gotten this far. At one point he said: I want to go on holiday. We don't have to be gone for long, we don't have to go far away. You can choose the location and if you just want to hang around the hotelroom every day that's fine. But I need a break from daily life. 

I spent most of the holiday in the hotel but I did go for a few walks. Having a panic attack in a different country feels different; the people who see you will never see you again, so it took away some of the shame aspect for me. 

After that summer college started again. I hadn't gone much the year before but I talked to my teachers and they allowed me to repeat the year. I didn't dare to take the bus (my anxiety is centered around being locked up) so I cycled to college every day for a while. 

When the weather got colder I realized I didn't want to cycle 13 kilometres through the snow so I tried going by bus. Not going anywhere, just getting in and seeing how many stops I could survive.

So, I kind of did exposure therapy on myself. I eventually got through the waiting list of a psychologist but by then I could go out by myself. After she went away for pregnancy leave I just pushed myself further and further. 

SO and I moved house in April to a cheap but lovely appartment in a lovely neighbourhood in a small village. I finally feel a bit at peace and I think that caused my sudden progress. 

This probably won't really help anyone as seeing a  professional probably is better than doing it all by yourself. I am just lucky enough to have my SO for support, even if he will never understand how important he was in this process.",o9ug52,1230,1.0,101,2021-06-28 21:59:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/o9ug52/i_am_so_proud_of_myself_and_i_need_to_tell_someone/,False,False,2021,6
6,I'm quitting my job due to anxiety. I feel like a failure.,"The day has finally come. After six years of teaching, I know I need to quit. My acid reflux and insomnia have gotten so bad that I feel like dying most days. People keep telling me to hang in there - that teaching gets better with time and experience. But it only keeps getting worse for me. The racing thoughts are ceaseless.

Now I need to figure out how to tell my supervisor. I know it's going to be a huge disappointment to him. He needs me. My school needs me. My students need me. But I need to put my health first now. I can't imagine what everyone is going to think of me. They will probably think I'm crazy or weak or both.

I've been looking for other jobs the past two years and haven't been able to find anything. I will be moving back home and living off of unemployment for as long as I can. Hopefully I can find something else soon.

Edit: Wow I want to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart. I've never felt so seen and supported in my life (and I'm not just saying that). I wrote this post as a ""let me just get these bad feelings out and send them out into the universe"" type of thing, never thinking I would get so much love in return. You are all amazing people and you are all FIGHTERS - not failures. You have helped me see that I am not a failure either, and I wish I could give each and every one of you a hug. I wish all of you the happiness and health that life has to offer. Thank you x a million.

7,I just shat myself during a panic attack. None of you can top this.,"Felt an attack starting in the morning. Decided to take a couple of benzos and go upstairs. In the middle of the staircase, my legs gave out and I knelt on the steps. My bowels then decided this is the time to go. 

Spent the next half hour cleaning myself, but at least most people will never top this.✌🏼✌🏼 

...Yes I am ok now, but fuck this shit.

8,I wish I could have a surgery to get rid of this fucking anxiety,"I've done so much work to get where I am and it never gets easier, it never gets better, it never heals and it never stops being hard. Compared to what I was a few years ago I am so far ahead... but it's fucking exhausting, I feel like every I have a weight around my neck.

9,I quit my six-figure job to recover,"This was possibly the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make. I’ve been at this job for 5 months now and the workload was immediately unmanageable for one person but I kept pushing through thinking I was just weak, I needed to work harder. After all this was an opportunity of a lifetime and others would kill to have this job!

It got to a point where my anxiety and depression was out of control. I dreaded work every morning and was crying 3 times a day every day for a month. I couldn’t stomach any food until dinner time. I wasn’t taking breaks and I was doing 12 hour days. Exercise was out of the question of course.

I knew I needed to quit but I felt like I couldn’t. I didn’t want to be that person that gives up. On top of that I felt incredibly guilty that if I did quit, my workload would be dumped on my boss and the team. I was (and still am) anxious about what people think of me. Do they think I’m a quitter?

All I was focused on was others and I forgot about me. How sad is that. 

The past week I managed to scrounge up the pieces of myself scattered across the floor and peel myself out of bed at 6:30 to run in the morning. I may have severe anxiety and depression but this is the one thing I can do for myself. 

I still have this nagging thought that I am crazy to throw away this salary but at the end of the day no amount of money is worth trading in my mental health for.

I don’t have a fully laid out plan of what I’m going to do but all I know is right now I need to heal and recover. Financially I am okay and my angel of a partner is supporting me in this.

I am by no means on the other side yet but I thought I would put this out into the world for anyone else who feels stuck in their job and afraid to quit. Feel free to DM.

UPDATE: Writing this update on 10 June 2022 (a week out from 1 year ago). Thank you to everyone that commented at the time. Your encouragement really helped me through a tough time. Over the past year I have consistently received private messages from people that have gone through or are currently going through the same situation.

At the time of my original post I felt so alone because I couldn’t find other people going through the same thing. I thought I would just be sending a rant into a black hole and it wouldn’t mean much but it has really been worth putting out there just to see how many people have reached out and the conversations that have come from it. 

As an update, I took 2 glorious months off and looking back, quitting was the best decision I ever made. I was ashamed and guilty for a while but I had the gift of TIME. To do things I wanted to do that had nothing to do with work and to heal. Of course I had incredible support so I could focus on building myself back up. I’m now back at work at a previous job (before the heinous one referred to above) and I’m doing well. I still have anxiety obviously but off anti-depressants now.

If you’re ever in the same broken state I was, I know that hesitation so well. I know its a tough decision but I still 100% recommend quitting. A career is not the entirety of life.",o0ovub,969,0.99,134,2021-06-15 21:19:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/o0ovub/i_quit_my_sixfigure_job_to_recover/,False,False,2021,6

12,I was just harassed in public,"This is why I hate going outside by myself. I simply went to get money out of a cash machine and in the parking lot there were a group of ‘men’ loitering outside their van. They started talking about my ass and how they couldn’t stop staring at it, like I was a meat product. I tried quickly to get money out of the machine and on my way out one of them slaps my ass. I felt so humiliated I ran home taking a longer route to avoid walking past them again. I want to cry. I am going out for a work meal and now I feel like I am dressed too provocatively and every person is going to think I’m a slut. I am wearing trousers and a crop top because of the hot weather. My anxiety is through the roof, I just want to curl up in bed and never go outside again.

Edit: thank you all for such supportive and kind messages. It’s so nice to be reminded that the world isn’t full of horrible people. It made me cry how supportive you all are. Thank you for the suggestions that I should report these people, once my head is clear I will definitely do something about it.

13,"I have illness anxiety disorder, and failed to get my scheduled COVID-19 vaccine a few months ago. Yesterday I bit the bullet and got my first dose! Yayy!","I'm not an antivaxxer! I believe in modern medicine. 

I was always scared of getting the vaccine, because we don't know the long-term effects of it. And I was also scared of getting it with the medication combination I'm on for my bipolar disorder, because I didn't know how it could react. 

The first time I told myself I would get it if I stop taking my medications a week prior to clear it out of my system so I can get the vaccine all by itself. That was a huge mistake, because of my bipolar disorder I became very mentally unstable which also in turn exacerbated my anxiety. And so I failed to make the appointment. 

This time, I got the vaccine and ironically I wasn't on any medication at all because my doctor took me off one medication because of it not working, and also because I've been in a major depression the last two weeks I literally forgot to take the other of the two medications for a week straight. *yes!, really it's as simple as I forgot, I know it's bad*. 

So not only did I push through the anxiety of getting the vaccine, I also got what I wanted in that I got it without being on medication. *It wasn't on purpose I swear! Haha* 

My arm hurts like hell and I feel really lightheaded and dizzy today But otherwise I'm okay. 
However I am highly unstable, because I'm not on any medication and my doctor is gone for the next two weeks on vacation. Another psychiatrist at the clinic told me not to restart my meds until I see my psych. (after stopping lamotrigine for more than five consecutive days You can't just simply restart it, You have to retitrate up to the target dose again)

The pharmacist as well as the nurse at the vaccine site said it's okay for me to take my Ativan, a benzodiazepine, before and after getting the vaccine but I decided not to because I fear mixing it with the vaccine. 

So I am just pushing through the anxiety that the symptoms are giving me and I'm doing okay! 

But I'm super proud of myself for biting the bullet and getting the vaccine as I am much more scared of catching COVID-19 than I am of the vaccine.",o3o6wb,899,0.97,67,2021-06-19 19:43:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/o3o6wb/i_have_illness_anxiety_disorder_and_failed_to_get/,False,False,2021,6
14,"I miss the days when I could relax, when my mind wasn't always searching for the next thing to be so overly nervous about","I hear so many friends talk about how middle school was awful for them, but I look back and remember it so fondly. Not because it was my ""glory days"" or anything like that, but because it was the last time I can remember being able to enjoy life as it comes, and to take things one moment at a time. Just being able to play video games and relax without my mind wandering to ultimately pointless things to be anxious about. Being able to enjoy my hobbies, being able to go out in public without thoughts consuming me about the judgement of every stranger that walks by. I miss the days of being able to do nothing productive, and not be wrought with guilt about it.

I'm 26 now. The best way I can put things is that on paper, my life looks pretty great. Anxiety makes things pretty tough a lot of the time, as I'm sure you can all empathize with. I'm sitting here right now at 1 pm on a Saturday; I don't have work today, all my chores are done, the apartment is spotless, and my grocery shopping is all done, yet just sitting around and wanting to have a lazy day is the hardest thing for me. I suppose I just needed to vent about this. I miss the way my mind used to work.

0,I took a blanket and a hot water bottle out to a homeless man sleeping under the stairs on my apartment building. I'm shaking and feel faint but am proud I did it.,"It's about 2 degrees Celsius at night where I live right now, for context. As I arrived home late this evening I saw a homeless man sleeping under some building insulation fabric in the outdoor stairwell of my apartment building. 

As soon as I got inside my nice toasty apartment I couldn't stop thinking about how the poor guy must be freezing. I couldn't help but feel such an aching sadness that so many people just would walk past, not doing anything because of their discomfort, just like the discomfort I was feeling. I decided fuck it, show this guy the care and common decency you would want if you were in a similar situation. I found a spare blanket I had, nice and fuzzy and warm, and a hot water bottle I don't use and filled it up with hot boiled water. I was shaking so hard at this point and almost chickened out. 

Barely getting my key in the door to unlock my deadbolt as I was shaking so much, I forced myself to walk outside to him with the blanket and hot water bottle. I apologised for disturbing him, and simply said he must be freezing and to keep both items. He told me I was a gem, and thanked me.

Im back inside my apartment now, feeling like I'm about to faint from the adrenalin and starting to cry from the stress of the situation, but I am so proud of myself. I conquered the anxiety today in favour of my gut feeling and desire to act on my belief of kindness to all.

I feel I'm making a big deal out of literally just being a decent human, but it was a big deal for me and my anxiety so I wanted to share the success.",okttam,2360,0.99,103,2021-07-15 14:20:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/okttam/i_took_a_blanket_and_a_hot_water_bottle_out_to_a/,False,False,2021,7

12,I hate constantly feeling like someone is mad at me,"It’s so tiring to constantly worry and have to check with people if they are mad. It makes people feel like I make everything about myself. When in reality I just need to make sure nobody is upset. I have a constant need to be liked and loved. I know everybody pretty much wants these things. But I get sick and feel extremely horrible when I even get a slight hint that someone might be upset with me. It’s just so tiring. I hate it and I feel like I can never be completely normal. I’ve made immense progress but it’s never going to be normal again. I can’t stop feeling guilty for everything I’ve ever done. And when I confess to family members about my guilt they act like I’m worrying about nothing. 

I obsess over things that happened years ago. And can’t let them go ever. I just cannot stop obsessing over things that probably didn’t even involve me or that nobody remembers or cares about anymore. I’m tired of thoughts that I’m a horrible person. I’m just so tired of it. It gets old to never feel comfortable with myself. The only times I do is when I’m in a group of people having fun. And I’m able to make them laugh. Whenever I’m alone and that connection is gone I just panic.

At this point I’m worried that I must be high maintenance and just need a lot of attention. I just want people to like me. I literally cannot stand the thought of people hating me. And I know there’s gotta be people out there. I know and understand why people get upset at my guilty feelings and confessions. It’s just hard to stop. I feel like I need reassurance which is a short lasting fix.

I know I have to start working towards something in order to feel fulfilled but since i have no idea what i want, i lose motivation soon enough. And thus i get stuck in this cycle of mediocrity, of understanding what i need to do, but not a reason as to why to do it. 

At this point im not even sure wether iv ever had or still have depression/anxiety/mental illness, i just know that since i was a kid ive never ever felt fullfilled. The past years ive seen problems come at me from so far away but i never seem to have the energy to move out of the way of the problem coming at me.

And lately it seems all the rest i get is from ether being asleep or getting drunk/high and finally getting rid of the annoyance that is being consience without purpose.

9,I'm angry at everyone who didn't notice I was struggling as a child,"This turned out to be quite a long ramble/vent but I just needed someone to listen.

I recently started the long process of getting a diagnosis and help for my anxiety. I haven't even gotten to a psychiatric nurse yet, not to speak of a doctor or an actual psychiatrist, but I have talked to the nurse who took first initiative in my case. She was very kind and offered to meet me face to face a few weeks before the psychiatric nurse appointment so I wouldn't have to wait well over a month to get any progress at all. During my appointment with her we quickly got to at least one of the reasons as to why I'm so anxious and it helped me realise that I have actually been prone to anxious behaviour from a young age.

What's now bothering me is that after the appointment I started to realise that I was indeed displaying signs of anxiety or trauma responses as a child but none of the adults in my life actually noticed it or cared enough (or maybe knew enough) to do something about it. Absolutely no one. I had both of my parents and many many teachers who just ignored all of it and that is probably one of the reasons I'm such a mess today. I did not get the help I needed as a child and now everything is a million times worse.

Now every time I get an anxious spell I cannot stop thinking about how the people who were supposed to care for me failed me horribly. It got even worse yesterday when my mother told me a story of her completely ignoring some quite alarming behaviour because she thought it was just a quirk of mine. I had an event I consider traumatic during my first ever swimming lesson in 1st grade. Long story short, the swimming instructor was angry screaming at me because I, as a 7 or 8 year old child, couldn't float on my own yet. After this event I completely stopped doing everything that had to do with swimming even though playing in the lake with floaties on was one of my favourite summer activities before the incident. I didn't continue swimming until over 5 years later when I finally learned how to swim due to mandatory swimming lessons as a part of school sports. Even now almost 20 years later I get anxious at the smell of swimming pools and chlorine and I avoid swimming halls, especially the one where it happened.

Yet somehow, my own god-damn parent, who was often overprotective of me, didn't think there was anything alarming about that. She was telling the story like it was just a weird little thing I chose to do, one of those funny little childhood anecdotes. And the swimming incident is just one of the many different events I remember, where I displayed anxiety symptoms and no one took them seriously. I just want to be angry and scream at everyone who did not notice my problems but that's never going to happen and I know that one day I will just have to make peace with the fact that most of them will never know how badly they failed me. But today is definitely not that day.",owodyh,988,0.98,108,2021-08-02 21:30:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/owodyh/im_angry_at_everyone_who_didnt_notice_i_was/,False,False,2021,8
10,People don't understand what anxiety is,"People don't understand what the impact of an anxiety disorder really is.

I really wish i could explain just how it feels to have GAD. But i don't know how so i'm just going to write what we have to deal with which people never seem to understand.

Anxiety disorders do not mean we feel anxious once in a while, it means we have to actively work on ourselves every day to live a comfortable life.

We have to regulate our diet and cut out certain food ands drinks.

We have constant tight muscles and often develop injuries because of this, not only that but stress weakens the immune system.
There is many more health issues we have or can develop because anxiety isn't just mental, it often represents itself physically.

We are unable to work or go to school because the stress of sensory input is too much. 

We can't leave our house or do regular tasks that others consider to be normal. It's a learning progress for us and we need patience.

We can be stuck in anxiety spirals for months and have anxiety attacks so bad that we lose a lot of weight because we are unable to eat, sleep or function and have very bad symptoms like puking or fainting.

We can be triggered by any stressful event and lots of things hit way harder for us like physical pain.

I wish the medical world would put more focus on anxiety so we don't have to go to the ER 3 times in one week because our anxiety attacks are so bad we literally can't do anything.

Im so tired of the mistreatment of us and people not understanding, feeling like i can never be myself or feel ""normal"" again.

I feel fine at the moment.
The only downside is that the side effects I have to look out for are almost exactly the same as manifestations of my anxiety, but I'm a little too relieved to think about it right now.

1) love yourself. Actually mean it though. Look in the mirror and instead of analyzing your body over anything that appears to be different tell yourself how amazing you are. 

2) drink water, I mean lots of water, drink some liquid IV also. Comes in many flavors and it’s a lot healthier than other drinks. Try to lay off the sodas (however treat yourself every now and then)

3) sleep. I mean sleep like you never slept before. Go to bed earlier, turn your phone on airplane mode and just let the cold room engulf you as if you are in the Arctic (that’s how cold I love it) 

4) eat healthier. Try not to eat chips, junk food. Baked chicken and veggies are great always. (Again treat yourself every once in awhile) 

5) breathing exercises. This is a great way to relieve stress and anxiety. Did you know breathing can help with a lot of medical problems? I suggest you read a book called “Breath” by James Nestor. It’s an extraordinary piece of work.

However, today I decided to go out into the park and I really craved a cup of hot coffee and only place around was a massive Starbucks.

I had no idea how to order or what to order so I asked the nice girl at the counter for a recommendation and size, waited for my cup and even drank it inside surrounded by people without a single panic attack! 

I feel really proud of myself and I have no one to share it to.

6,Does anyone else find themselves having anxiety about having to get up early in the morning?,"I'm 27. I've been trying to get to the root of my anxiety and this morning, while driving to work, it dawned on me (no pun intended) that the source of my anxieties might have to do with my disdain of having to get up early for work.

I have a problem where I can't stop thinking about work during weekends, when I'm home at night, on vacation, etc. Work dominates my thinking, but in an unproductive way. I don't go over anything specific, I simply ruminate about the fact that I have to do it. A lot of it has to do with my disdain of not being able to have full control over my time and having to sacrifice so much of my life to a job.

I typically end up having a decent day at work, nothing wild. Every now and again I'll have a hell day. I often fear having those days, weeks in advance, and they typically never come, but they eventually do. 

Going back to my time, a massive hurdle for me is accepting that I need to get to bed early so that I can have enough energy for the following day. There is something about that...and it makes me feel powerless. It feels like the rest of my life is just a waiting room for work but I realize how absurd that sounds. I know it's untrue, but we also live in such a hyper industrial and profit-addicted capitalist society that I know (unfortunately) that what I'm saying has some form of validity to it, and I wish it weren't so.

Anyone else experience this? I'm a grown guy with a career and yet here I am, at the best job I've had to date, miserable about having to go to it because it means I don't have full control over my time.",quvxse,1047,0.99,158,2021-11-16 01:29:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/quvxse/does_anyone_else_find_themselves_having_anxiety/,False,False,2021,11

It's also not just one run of diarrhea, it can be like an ordeal of 2 or 3 runs to the toilet. I'm really not comfortable to have these ""diarrhea runs"" at a friends or family house, as they usually get quite concerned once I start running, wondering if they did something that made me sick.

5,What having Anxiety look like:,"No motivation.

Shortness of breath.
Overthinking. 
Negative thinking. 
Sleep problems.
Sleeping  to escape from reality. 
Crying.
Disassociation.

1,Ukraine Megathread,"Update 4/15: A group of people from this community have created r/UkraineAnxiety

Update 4/13: We have decided to formally close this thread to new comments. We feel that this thread is too taxing for us to moderate and is no longer worth the strain on our mod team like it was back when the situation was brand new. We want to thank everyone who has stuck around to help others stay level-headed through this whole mess!

Update 3/27: Due to all the feedback we got from updates 3/20 and 3/21, we have decided to relax the requirements for posting links. You are free to post a link you want help with or to add commentary on to help others understand it in a less anxious way, and now you can once again post links to good news as well as create good news collections (see the current stickied comment which includes some info on reassurance-seeking behavior). Our one requirement is that you should refrain from posting multiple times over a short period with good news links. If someone does this we will begin taking down their comments as spam. In this case it would be better to put together multiple news links and then post them as a single comment.

*~~Update 3/21: Please see the current stickied comment for more information. It is ok to include a link that is causing you anxiety and asking people to help explain it better. It is also ok to provide a news link alongside your own commentary about the article to help people understand what it is saying in a less anxious way. We're specifically going to remove comments that have one or more news links without asking for help or providing original commentary about the article.~~*

*~~Update 3/20: We have seen a large amount of posts that are mainly about sharing/discussing specific news articles. Please remember to keep everything relevant to anxiety. If a comment is just a news link then we have decided we will have to remove it to keep the thread on topic.~~*

Hi everyone,

It has been requested that we create a megathread for all of the events that have been happening with regards to the conflict in Ukraine. We decided that this is a good idea since so many people have been experiencing extreme anxiety because of it.

We have opted to have this thread be sorted by Best for the time being. To read and respond to the latest comments you can manually change the sort to New. The reason we’re doing this is because we want the most helpful and most grounded comments to float to the top to help as many people as possible keep their anxiety under control during this difficult time.

For those who want to talk with other anxiety sufferers in more of a live format, feel free to join our official Discord server with this invite link: [https://discord.com/invite/9sSCSe9](https://discord.com/invite/9sSCSe9). We have added a special channel to it called ""#ukrainediscussion"" so people can talk about what's happening and help each other.

As always please remember to be supportive and report any problematic comments so we can remove them as soon as possible.

Thanks!

1,Does anybody else cope by just looking forward to going to sleep,"A coping mechanism I have is that I’ll sort of get through the hours of the day until it is nighttime and I know I can have the sweet release of sleep soon. Of course this isn’t every day but I usually look forward to sleep because it’s the only time I am really guaranteed not to feel anxiety/dread.

Of course, some days I will sorta forget about it, but it seems that the like the main objective of the day is to get to the end of it. Funny enough, I actually don’t mind living like that, I find it very comforting knowing I get an 8-hour break from my anxiety every day. I still have plenty of days where I am enjoying the things through the day, but even on those days when 5 hours fly by I’m like “oh bonus I’m closer to bed”.

Some days it’s like my only hope though where I am really all over the place and it’s my anchor to keep going. Idk, I’m sure it sounds bad that I “look forward to going to sleep everyday” but I find it a pretty good coping mechanism.",tjg8w0,1200,1.0,104,2022-03-21 16:50:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/tjg8w0/does_anybody_else_cope_by_just_looking_forward_to/,False,False,2022,3
2,I (41M) stood up for myself in a relationship for the first time in my life. It cost the relationship but I feel great about valuing my needs. Use meds if you can people. I wish I started sooner.,"She told me kissing me wasn't worth it. She said she won't be able to give me a family I wanted so what's the point. She could have been discussing the weather. 

She then in the same breath asked me to help her with a presentation. 

She is a doctor. Makes 4 times more then I do. She is accustomed to getting her way. Saying things without consequences. 

Not this time. Not with me. 

 I stood up. Told her she needs to reevaluate her wants in life and I'm going to give her her space. 

I left. She messaged me. She wanted me to go on a trip with her. She said she was willing to pay.

 I asked her ""what's the point?"". 

Before meds I would have been at her beck and call. I would have been in shambles. I would have given her opportunities time and time again. 

I will miss her mother. I will miss her dogs. I won't miss being treated that way. I am saddened that I'm alone again. But I'm effin proud that I drew my line in the sand and refused to budge. 

If you have the opportunity to seek help, use meds etc please do so. The power and self worth that comes with less anxiety is amazing.
