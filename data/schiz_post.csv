24,A reminder to fellow schizophrenics...,"I suffer with schizophrenia. I try to remind myself these things: the voices do not exist. Your family is not trying to kill you. Killing yourself to reach another reality is not a sound idea, despite how much you might believe in it. You will die. Just because you don’t know what happens after death doesn’t mean you should take the chance. You will never see your family again if you do that because people in caskets can’t see their family. You can’t read minds. No one can. So how can you be reading your teacher’s negative thoughts about you? It’s not happening. You cannot see the future. It’s impossible. Otherwise how have we not been able to predict earthquakes or cancer cures? You are not the only person convinced they are experiencing the apocalypse or the return of god. This does not make those delusions true. You are sick. Just like someone with pneumonia. You are gonna make it. I am not trying to tell you what your experience is. This is mine. Understanding this really helped me personally. I learned the hard way I should not listen to voices that tell me to harm myself.",fafi0y,218.0,0.94,93.0,2020-02-27 17:25:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/fafi0y/a_reminder_to_fellow_schizophrenics/,0.0,0.0,2020,2

Even though I dropped out twice and had to be hospitalized a couple times, I made it to the end! I'm exhausted now but it was worth it. Ive finally earned my BA in psychology! I plan on using it to get a job as a behavior tech this summer or volunteer for a crisis line, and I'll be applying to MA in counseling programs.

4,My brother with schizophrenia jumped in front of a car going 60+ miles last Saturday. I watched him die in the ICU alone with me.,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I knew he was schizophrenic and tried to tell my family long before he was diagnosed. They didn’t believe me. Even after he was diagnosed they didn’t buy it. Of course they tried to help, but they were treating it like someone going through a phase or like something that was temporary. 

I came here 6-ish months ago looking for help. You all gave me wonderful advice but it was me against my family and they wouldn’t listen. 

It just got too bad. He was too far gone. My family keeps telling me “there was nothing we could do” and that virtually all people with schizophrenia live terrible lives until they die alone (of course they finally admitted it was schizophrenia after he died). But I know that isn’t true because I see many of you on here trying and succeeding— people with this illness CAN be helped. I don’t have the heart to verbally disagree with them because the lie helps them sleep at night.

Edit: forgot to mention he was also schizoaffective.

Edit: not sure where I gave the impression that my family didn’t care about him. They tried very very hard. They were just treating it as if it were a phase or a personality problem. If someone is severely schizophrenic they need more help than the ‘average’ person with common emotional issues.

Edit: can people stop blaming my family please",hx0x0r,276.0,1.0,72.0,2020-07-24 12:30:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/hx0x0r/my_brother_with_schizophrenia_jumped_in_front_of/,0.0,0.0,2020,7

22,There isn’t just a stigma surrounding schizophrenia and related conditions. There is a stigma surrounding psychiatry.,"TL;DR at the bottom. 

The schizo stigma gets talked about a lot. I do not see many people addressing the stigma surrounding psychiatry. 

There is an entire subreddit devoted to it. The members do not seem to realize that what they really are is anti modern medicine. There isn’t a single criticism of psychiatric treatment that could not be said of other specialties. 

If you’ve been in the mental health system for a while, you’ve probably heard all of the criticism. 

1. They don’t know how the medication works
2. The medication doesn’t work
3. The medication has bad, sometimes permanent side effects. 
4. Hospitals are prisons that take away your basic human rights. 
5. Some of the medications are very addictive. 
6. Psychiatrists are just guessing, they don’t really know what’s wrong with you. 
7. This list could go on and on. 

Every one of these weak criticisms could be said of all fields of medicine. Only psychiatry deals with the bad rap. 

Let’s start from the top. 

1. “Method of action unknown” is said of a great many meds. We don’t know how anesthesia works. We use it every day and it clearly works, however it works. It can also cause delirium and worsen dementia in the elderly. 

2. Most of the clinical trials performed for antipsychotics show 80% of patients reporting a reduction or elimination of symptoms. Plenty of other medications do not work for everyone. There are people that have had surgery that swear gabapentin totally relieves their pain. Other patients say it’s like taking sugar pills. They need a different stronger medication(with worse side effects)

3. Speaking of side effects, you’d be hard pressed to find a medication that doesn’t have any. Listen to any drug commercial if you don’t believe me. It’s a cost/benefit analysis. If you have crazy high cholesterol, you may take statins. They help lower cholesterol but they give you liver problems. You take the statins because you fear a heart attack over liver disease. It’s the same reason we take “zombie pills” to relieve the torture of hallucinations. 

4. While not all hospitals are exactly like a secured psychiatric facility, no hospital is fun. Also, if your condition is bad enough, a regular hospital won’t allow you to leave either. Armed security will make you stay. They’re every bit as much of a “prison”. Oh, and you don’t need to be in a mental hospital to get sedated if you act up. 

5. Many medications have the potential for addiction. Opioids get a bad rap these days, but even drugs like lyrica can be abused. You can get addicted to DXM cough syrup. 

6. There’s no such thing as doctor House and his team. They don’t run test after test until they learn your condition and cure you with a pill. I went to the ER covered in red bumps. The doctor said I had “non specific viral rash”. My second opinion said that it was obviously mononucleosis. The test was negative but the doctor said it didn’t matter. 

In summation. Psychiatry works like all other medicine. We must fight the stigma of psychiatry before we can win the fight of ending the stigma of schizophrenia. If you believe that something can go wrong with your heart, which is nothing more than a pump, then you must believe that something can go wrong with the most complicated organ in your body. 

Some quotes from my doctor: 

“there is no distinction between a physical and mental illness. The two aren’t separate.” 

“Ultimately, whatever causes mental health issues is a physical thing”

“It’s not mental health. It’s just health”

TL;DR: anti psychiatry is BS that is actually anti medicine.",jon52w,204.0,0.96,172.0,2020-11-05 17:39:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/jon52w/there_isnt_just_a_stigma_surrounding/,0.0,0.0,2020,11

12,Police officers interacting with people that have Schizophrenia,"Hey y'all. Im a cop.

I don't understand what it is like to live with Schizophrenia, and I don't understand Schizophrenia in general. 

My question - For those that have Schizophrenia, if you were having some sort of breakdown or Schizophrenic episode (I don't know the proper terminology, bear with me) how can a police officer help you/not make things worse if they end up getting called to handle the situation?  

Im being genuine here. I want to help work towards a better future for us, and a big part of that is understanding different mental states. So let's talk!

18,Most so-called mental illness advocates have no idea what mental health help is in the US.,"You hear it all of the time from so-called progressives. “That homeless person needs mental health help” or “that criminal doesn’t belong in prison, they need mental health treatment”

While those statements may be true, the majority of these people have no clue what the mental healthcare system is in the United States. 

It is, at best, outpatient treatment where you get prescribed medication that, while it treats your symptoms, makes you feel awful. It is, at worst, a prison-like hospital where you stay indefinitely until you tell a doctor “I’m fine” enough times until a doctor or judge allows you to leave, sometimes with court ordered injections. 

Again, mental health treatment is what many homeless and “criminals” need, but the vast majority of so-called mental illness advocates haven’t the slightest idea of what they’re condemning people to when they suggest mental health help. 

What advocates need to focus on is improving the quality of the mental healthcare system. There needs to be a much heavier focus on talk therapy and much less 10 minute sessions with a doctor that prescribes you a random antipsychotic and sees you again in 2 months. 

Mental hospitals need to look more like a hotel than a prison. They need to be places of comfort. They need to be places that the mentally ill aren’t afraid to go to(and most people that have been to psych hospitals are). 

In summation, I think that the people who have a “help is out there” attitude need to realize that, in many cases, help is not out there. That needs to change. 

We need a mental healthcare system that is something to be desired, not feared.",ldan6n,191.0,0.99,52.0,2021-02-05 16:19:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/ldan6n/most_socalled_mental_illness_advocates_have_no/,0.0,0.0,2021,2

7,“Schizophrenia will ruin your life”,"When I first got diagnosed in a hospital  I thought of it as a death sentence. I was 18(20 now) and I knew it was progressive. I thought about the horror stories of losing my family and becoming homeless or having to take meds that’ll make me fat and lay in bed wanting to die all day. And the more I thought like that, the more it became true. 

But I can say now that I’m doing really well. I got on abilify and for whatever reason it works better than Zyprexa. I have a job, a place to sleep, I call my family every day to wish them a good day and to show them that I’m in a good place mentally. I’ve begun programming and working on projects. I have friends, I no longer abuse drugs, etc. 

Sometimes though I do still experience psychosis and even at work. But to me it’s nothing to be scared of. It’s like back pain. Some people experience it temporarily while other people it’s an everyday struggle. Schizophrenia to me is my form of back pain. And now that I’ve learned more about the illness and my specific delusions that come up I can dismiss it and move on with my day. The voices can be scary but when they happen(99% after I get off work). I take a nice warm shower. Lay in bed, and take a sleeping pill and pass out. 

This illness CAN ruin your life, but I won’t let it happen to me. I’ve reached out for help from god, doctors, and my family. I want to help people who are not as fortunate to have those resources. Because even though there’s not a cure there is hope to live a happy life",opcb4g,195.0,0.99,31.0,2021-07-22 11:55:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/opcb4g/schizophrenia_will_ruin_your_life/,0.0,0.0,2021,7
